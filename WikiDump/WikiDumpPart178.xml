I have written the Wikibook [[Usability for Nerds]] which discusses the user interfaces of technical products. In a few examples I have excerpts of screendumps from commercial software. It is arguable whether such screen excerpts are copyright protected or not, however, they are not allowed on Wikimedia Commons. Therefore, I need to upload them as fair use. Where can I upload them, and how do I get permission? [[User:Agnerf|Agnerf]] ([[User talk:Agnerf|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Agnerf|contribs]]) 10:16, 4 August 2014 (UTC)
:They are subject to copyright which is why they are not permitted on Commons. Do you understand what Fair Use means and how it limits the use of such images here?

::Yes. [[User:Agnerf|Agnerf]] ([[User talk:Agnerf|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Agnerf|contribs]]) 12:53, 4 August 2014 (UTC)

::::He stated &quot;It is arguable whether such screen excerpts are copyright protected or not, however, they are not allowed on Wikimedia Commons.&quot; that implies some understanding and at least that he has read the information on the subject at Commons.

Bryan has not moved his bot ([[User:BryanBot]] (mwclientbased, python)) to toolslabs, this means that the bot will stop working in a few dayes (toolserver will be switched off the 30th).

A green bean is a vegetable. Green beans are sold fresh, frozen or canned.

qingdouh shih yi zhoong shucaih, shihchaang yoou xinxian, leengdohng huoh guahnzhuang chushouh.

----

Green beans are cooked by steaming, boiling, stir frying, deep frying, or in casseroles. In the United States, they are sometimes served in casserole with mushrooms, onions and cream. In Chinese cuisine, they are often stir-fried with garlic and douchi (fermented black soybeans). In Japanese cuisine, they are served as tempura.

----

Green beans contain lectins. That makes them harmful if a person eats too many raw or improperly cooked ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pitchers are by far the most critical players on defense. They are so important on defense that their ability to hit a pitched ball is trivial. When a pitcher falters or tires he is often replaced with a relief pitcher. Pitchers get credit for winning or losing games. A statistic known as earned-run (ERA) average measures the effectiveness of a pitcher, a low ERA generally indicates a good pitcher and a high one indicates a poor one. The pitcher's position in scoring is designated with the number &quot;1&quot;

== Pitching ==

The pitcher spends most of the time when his team is on the field in nearly the center of the infield. He can throw left-handed or right-handed (but he is not allowed to go from pitching left-handed to right-handed or vice versa during the game) and he can throw overhand (the vast majority of pitchers so do), side-arm, or underhand. 

== Getting outs ==     

A pitcher gets most of his success by inducing outs from batters that he confronts. That can result from a strikeout that results from the pitcher getting the batter getting three strikes or hitting a ball so that the batted ball leads to an out (fly balls and line drives caught before landing, ground balls typically to infielders who throw the ball to another base to put out a base runner (usually the batter who must reach first base lest he make an out). If he induces three outs before any runs score, then he has done a good job in that inning.   

A pitcher throws a baseball toward the plate, and with that the action usually begins in baseball.  The pitcher ordinarily throws the ball toward home plate, where the batter tries either to hit the ball or 'take' a pitch. The batter must swing at a pitched ball that goes through any part of the strike zone lest he get a called strike which may contribute to a strikeout, but if the batter swings and misses at a pitched ball whether it is in or out of the strike zone, then such results in a strike that can also contribute to a strikeout.

The strikeout is ordinarily the least troublesome (but not always the best) result for a pitcher. The batter is out without effectively hitting the ball (except for the rare and unlikely situation in which the batter takes a called third strike or swings and misses but reaches first base when the catcher fails to catch the ball and cannot throw to first base to put out the batter at first base). Pitchers can also get outs (successes against a batter) by inducing the batter to hit a ball so that it either 

(1) is caught as a fair or foul fly before it can reach the ground, or
(2) is hit to a fielder (typically an infielder, which can include the pitcher or catcher) after hitting the ground who then either touches a base while in possession of the ball before a runner who must reach that base, or throws the ball to another infielder who can touch the base before a base runner obliged to reach that base can touch it.

Failure of a pitcher to get an out typically comes from one of three causes:

(1) a '''hit''' which results from a batter hitting a fair ball so that it hits the ground before a fielder can retrieve it and throw it to a base so that some infielder can put a base runner out -- or either reaches the fence on the fly or flies over the fence (a ball hit in fair territory but over the fence is the disastrous '''home run''' that allows the batter and all base runners then on base to score runs).

(2) a '''walk''' in which a batter refuses to swing at four 'balls&quot; before hitting a fair ball or getting a third strike, or (the intentional walk, which is an option in some situations) in which the pitcher deliberately throws a fourth unhittable ball outside the strike zone. The batter is allowed to reach first base, and base runners are compelled to advance as necessary (the batters are usually delighted to advance a base)  

(3) a '''hit batsman''', an incident in which a ball striking the batter or his clothing, shoes, or batter's helmet (but not his bat) with a ball not in the strike zone at which the batter does not swing         

Pitchers choose the pitches that they use in an effort to confuse a batter typically to induce an out. Such will usually be done with some understanding of the ability of the hitter.

== Rules of pitching ==

The pitcher must not commit a balk while pitching. The pitcher must have contact with the 'rubber' on the pitcher's mound. The rules against the balk practically define how a pitcher can pitch.

With any runners on base -- any base -- a pitcher commits a balk if he:

switches his pitching position from the windup to the set (or vice versa) without properly disengaging the rubber;

while on the rubber, makes a motion associated with his pitch and does not complete the delivery;

when pitching from the set position, fails to make a complete stop with his hands together before beginning to pitch;

throws from the mound to a base without stepping toward (gaining distance in the direction of) that base;

throws or feints a throw from the rubber to an unoccupied base, unless a play is imminent;

steps or feints from the rubber to first or third base without completing the throw (doing so to second base is legal);

delivers a quick return, a pitch thrown right after receiving the ball back, with intent to catch the batter off-guard;

drops the ball while on the rubber, even if by accident, if the ball does not subsequently cross a foul line;

while intentionally walking a batter, releases a pitch while the catcher is out of his box with one or both feet

unnecessarily delays the game

pitches while facing away from the batter;

after bringing his hands together on the rubber, separates them except in making a pitch or a throw;

stands on or astride the rubber without the ball, or mimics a pitch without the ball; or
throws to first when the first baseman, because of his distance from the base, is unable to make a play on the runner there.

delivers a pitch during a squeeze play or a steal of home, if the catcher or some other player steps on or in front of home base without possession of the ball, or touches the batter or his bat. The ball is dead, the batter is awarded first base, the pitcher is charged with a balk, and the run scores.

Any balk with a runner on base allows each runner to advance one base, including home plate for a runner at third base as the pitcher starts to throw his pitch. Balks are comparatively rare, but they can cause a run to score even ending a game. 

Pitchers are never allowed to make deliberate throws at the head or neck of the batter. Umpires have discretion in determining whether a pitcher has deliberately thrown at a batter. In the most flagrant cases an umpire can eject a pitcher for throwing a pitch intended to
cause injury to the batter. Accidents happen, and umpires are accepted to interpret not-so-deliberate throws as non-violations.   

== Tampering with the baseball ==

A pitcher is never allowed to alter a ball in any way by rubbing it against anything (including his clothing and flesh, emery boards, sharp objects) or applying any foreign substance including his own saliva or perspiration which creates a &quot;spitball&quot; that travels erratically. A pitcher caught tampering with the ball will be ejected from the game.

At the discretion of the umpire (typically during cold conditions), umpires will allow pitchers to blow onto their hands so that they can keep their hands nimble enough to pitch effectively.

== Pitch types ==

== Attempting to prevent baserunner advances  (stolen bases, wild pitches, passed balls) == 

A pitcher must try to avoid making a wild pitch if runners are on base. Such a pitch goes past the catcher  and gives one or more base runners a chance to advance a base. A passed ball or stolen base often results from a pitcher either throwing a pitch far out of the strike zone that the catcher cannot catch or a pitch for which the catcher cannot prepare (such as a low and inside pitch when the catcher expects one high and outside).   

A pitcher has some responsibility for deterring the stolen base. To thwart the stolen base a pitcher can pitch efficiently, not giving the base runner an edge in an effort to steal the next pitch. 

Typically he pitches so that the pitched ball gets quickly to the catcher who can then make a throw to the base that the base runner is attempting to steal. Of course the pitcher can put a greater effort into inducing an out that might make a stolen base irrelevant. He can throw to an occupied base or to one to which a runner is running.

== Fielding == 

Once the ball is hit, the pitcher is for all practical purposes another infielder. He can catch fair or foul flies (although he usually defers the catch to other infielders or the catcher), and he can retrieve ground balls that he can then throw to bases in efforts to put out base runners. He can usually reach first base before a batter running to first base. On a ball hit to the right side of the infield, a pitcher is usually expected to run to first base, especially if the batter causes the first baseman to go far from first base in an effort to retrieve a ground ball in the knowledge that he must throw to another fielder. In the event of a rundown play he can throw a ball and tag a runner. On what could otherwise be a wild pitch or passed ball he may run to home plate in an effort to retrieve a ball bouncing back or thrown by the catcher to tag a base runner attempting to score.

== 90% of the game? ==

It is an old saying that pitching is 90% of the game. Such is terribly imprecise. Runs scored and runs prevented are equally important; offense is just as important as defense. 

Pitchers are 'only' about 40% of the 25-man roster. At the low end, teams may have eight pitchers active at one time and at the high end, teams may have eleven. Pitchers are not 90% of the trade value of a team; teams have traded two starting pitchers for one regular position player. The best pitchers do not win 90% of the games that they pitch. No pitcher consistently gets 90% of all batters facing him to make outs.     

Most likely, pitching is 90% of the choices on defense. Teams can win or lose because the manager removes a pitcher too late, and a pitcher can win or lose a game in a critical situation through a bad selection of pitches. Teams generally don't get a chance to change a batter's swing during a game.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Self-explaining user interfaces are preferred if they can be implemented without too much complication. A drop-down menu is a good example of a self-explaining interface.

[[File:Menu (computing) example.PNG|center|Drop down menu]]

A bad example is a desktop shortcut in Microsoft Windows 7. This square, which just looks like an empty space, is actually a shortcut that you can click on to view the desktop. It is not obvious that this little square actually has a function - or what that function might be. A user looking for a shortcut to the desktop is very unlikely to find it.

[[File:Windows 7 desktop shortcut click area.png|center|Clickable square in Windows 7 to launch desktop]]

An icon or pictogram is intended to be self-explaining, and it works well if it is easy to understand or the meaning is generally known.

[[File:Aseos para Minusválidos.jpg|center|Pictogram for handicap access]]

But an icon or pictogram is useless if incomprehensible or easily misunderstood. This pictogram means ''Remember'', but it may be misinterpreted to mean ''Emergency room''.

[[File:Pict. Remember.jpg|center|Pictogram Dressed finger]]

This icon, named ''Control Center 3'', opens the software for controlling a scanner. This is not obvious to the user.

[[File:Icon control center 3.png|center|Icon Control Center 3]]

While a self-explaining button or icon can be useful, it should not be so conspicuous as to be disturbing or importunate.

The {{wp|Common Gateway Interface}} ([[Apache/CGI|CGI]]) allows to execute some Python programs on an HTTP server.

== Installation ==
By default, open a .py file in HTTP returns its content. In order to make the server compile and execute the source code, he must be placed in a directory including an ''[[Apache/.htaccess|.htaccess]]'' file, with the lines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.python.org/howto/webservers.html|lang=en|title=HOWTO Use Python in the web}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
 AddHandler cgi-script .py
 Options +ExecCGI

Attention: on the Unix-like servers the files aren't executable by default, so this must be set with the command: ''chmod +x *.py''.

== Examples ==
The module &lt;code&gt;cgitb&lt;/code&gt; is used for debugging:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!C:\Program Files (x86)\Python\python.exe
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
print &quot;Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n\n&quot;
print &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Local directory&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&quot;
import cgitb
cgitb.enable()
import os
print &quot;The CGI file is located into:&quot;
print os.path.dirname(__file__)
print &quot;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

The usage of a form needs an &lt;code&gt;import cgi&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fr.openclassrooms.com/informatique/cours/apercu-de-la-cgi-avec-python&lt;/ref&gt;. 

For a [[MySQL]] database, its &lt;code&gt;import MySQLdb&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://pypi.python.org/pypi/MySQL-python/1.2.5&lt;/ref&gt;.

The following file is called ''CGI_MySQL.py'', and uses the both modules:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!C:\Program Files (x86)\Python\python.exe
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
print &quot;Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8\n\n&quot;
print &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;DB CGI&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&quot;
print &quot;&lt;h1&gt;MySQL extraction&lt;/h1&gt;&quot;
print &quot;&lt;ul&gt;&quot;
import cgitb
cgitb.enable()
import cgi, MySQLdb
form = cgi.FieldStorage()
if form.getvalue('name') == None:
	print &quot;&lt;h2&gt;Research a name&lt;/h2&gt;&quot;
	print '''
	&lt;form action=&quot;CGI_MySQL.py&quot; method=&quot;post&quot;&gt;
	&lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;
	&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;&lt;/form&gt;
		'''
else:
	print &quot;&lt;h2&gt;Result&lt;/h2&gt;&quot;
	print &quot;List for &quot; + form.getvalue('name') + &quot; :&quot;
	connection = MySQLdb.connect(user='login1', passwd='passwd1', db='base1')
	cursor = connection.cursor()
	cursor.execute(&quot;SELECT page_title FROM page WHERE name ='&quot;+form.getvalue('name')+&quot;'&quot;)
	for row in cursor.fetchall():
		print &quot;&lt;li&gt;%s&lt;/li&gt;&quot; % row[0]
	connection.close()
print &quot;&lt;/ul&gt;&quot;
print &quot;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Principle ==
In order to protect a directory in particular (and its subdirectories), it suffices to place a file called &lt;code&gt;[[w:.htaccess|.htaccess]]&lt;/code&gt; inside. Apache will instantly apply its rules after, only in this tree structure.

Attention: the Windows explorer doesn't allow to name some files beginning by a dot, but a text editor is able to save as ''.htaccess''.

For example, to forbid to visualize a directory files which hasn't got any index (eg: .html, .php), add the code: &lt;code&gt;Options -Indexes&lt;/code&gt;.

== Protection by provenance ==
Numerous robots uses to try to crack some databases (for instance via {{wp|PhpMyAdmin}}). To protect from them, it's possible to authorize only two IP to read the directory:
;&lt;code&gt;deny from all&lt;/code&gt;
;&lt;code&gt;allow from 127.0.0.1&lt;/code&gt;
;&lt;code&gt;allow from 127.0.0.2&lt;/code&gt;

If the authorization ranges have some addresses in common with the prohibited ranges, it's better to specify their precedence (the lines order in the .htaccess file doesn't change anything):
;&lt;code&gt;order allow, deny&lt;/code&gt; : begin by the authorizations and then start the interdictions, by risking to ban what was previously allowed.
;&lt;code&gt;order deny, allow&lt;/code&gt; : the contrary is less restrictive.

== Protection by password ==
=== Authentication configuration ===
It's imperative to allow the authentication parameters modifications in the Apache settings.

The directive [http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/core.html#allowoverride AllowOverride] of a parent directory must contain the option &lt;code&gt;AuthConfig&lt;/code&gt;.

The directives to place in the &lt;code&gt;.htaccess&lt;/code&gt; are:
;&lt;code&gt;AuthType basic&lt;/code&gt;: authentication type communally adopted but poorly secured.
;&lt;code&gt;AuthName &quot;My message&quot;&lt;/code&gt;: the text as an invite in the dialog box.
;&lt;code&gt;AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/my_passwd&lt;/code&gt;: the passwords file path.
;&lt;code&gt;Require valid-user&lt;/code&gt;: specifies that a valid account is needed to accede to the folder.

We can also use &lt;code&gt;Require user toto sasa&lt;/code&gt; to authorize only the two accounts ''toto'' &amp; ''sasa''.

The authentication type ''basic'' uses not crypted passwords.

Some other more secured types exist, like ''digest'', which is recommended to combine with [[../SSL|HTTPS]].

The first request is addressed to the protected directory and provokes the displaying of the dialog box, from which the user should identify (with login and password):
* If the password is invalid, the dialog will be displayed again.
* If it's valid, the navigator can record it, and never ask it again until the next relaunching.

=== Passwords file ===
The following command creates a passwords file called with one user ''toto'':
 htpasswd -c /home/user/www/.htpasswd toto

To add or modify a user:
 htpasswd /home/user/www/.htpasswd sasa

Then, tell to .htaccess the .htpasswd path with:
 AuthName &quot;Protected page&quot;
 AuthType Basic
 AuthUserFile &quot;/home/user/www/.htpasswd&quot;
 Require valid-user

== Redirections ==
The syntax is the same as the general URL rewriting, unless it will only affect the .htaccess directory.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== CGI scripts ==
The CGI ({{wp|Common Gateway Interface}}) is a norm permitting Apache to execute some programs, which can be written in any programming language ([[Bash Shell Scripting|Bash]], [[C]], [[Java]], [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python]]...), from the moment it's executable and it respects certain in/out constraints.

=== Configure the CGI scripts access ===
To make Apache interpret the scripts, it's necessary to do a minimum of settings in the site configuration.

==== ScriptAlias ====
The directive (from ''httpd.conf''):
 ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ ''/scripts path/''
precise the folder name where Apache is authorized to executer the CGI scripts&lt;ref&gt;http://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/en/howto/cgi.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

Unix example:
 ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /var/www/cgi-bin
Windows example, use the URL format (no backslash):
 ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ &quot;C:/wamp/bin/apache/apache2.2.27/cgi-bin/&quot;

Actually the path &lt;code&gt;/cgi-bin/&lt;/code&gt; doesn't really exist, it's redirected to the scripts path, set by the directive, and it allows to write some URL like &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://server/cgi-bin/my_script&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

==== ExecCGI ====
The following clause activates the option &lt;code&gt;ExecCGI&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;/var/www/cgi-bin&lt;/code&gt;, which authorize Apache to execute some scripts on the server:
 &lt;Directory /var/www/cgi-bin&gt;
   Options ExecCGI
 &lt;/Directory&gt;

For example, if a script is called &lt;code&gt;essai.cgi&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;/home/httpd/cgi-bin&lt;/code&gt;:
 &lt;Directory /home/httpd/cgi-bin&gt;
   Options ExecCGI
 &lt;/Directory&gt;
Then, call the URL: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://serveur/cgi-bin/essai.cgi&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

==== AddHandler ====
This clause permits to choose the files extensions which will be authorized, eg:
 AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .exe .pl .py .vbs

==== Recapitulation ====
Full example on Windows, in the Apache configuration:
 ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ &quot;E:/www/cgi-bin/&quot;
 &lt;Directory &quot;E:/www/cgi-bin/&quot;&gt;
   Options FollowSymLinks Indexes
   AllowOverride All
   Order deny,allow
   Allow from all
   Require all granted		
 &lt;/Directory&gt;

In &lt;code&gt;E:/www/cgi-bin/.htaccess&lt;/code&gt; :
 AddHandler cgi-script .cgi .exe .pl .py .vbs

=== Write a CGI program ===
The main constraint concerns the program outputs. If a CGI script generates some data on its standard output, he must display an HTTP header before, allowing to identify them.

==== Bash ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
#!/bin/bash

# Header
echo &quot;Content-type: text/html&quot;

# Header end
echo &quot;&quot;

# Content to display in the navigator
echo &quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;Hello World!&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

This script generates an HTML page.

==== Perl ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
#!c:/perl/perl/bin/perl.exe -w
use CGI;
my $query = new CGI;
my $Name = $query-&gt;param('Name');
print $query-&gt;header();
print &quot;Hello World!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Python ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!C:\Program Files (x86)\Python\python.exe
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
print &quot;Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8&quot;
print
print &quot;Hello World!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

==== VBS ====
For Windows&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.uniformserver.com/index.php/CGI:_VBScript_CGI&lt;/ref&gt;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
'!c:/windows/system32/cscript //nologo
Wscript.Echo &quot;Content-type: text/html&quot; &amp; vbLF &amp; vbLF
WScript.Echo &quot;Hello World!&quot;
Wscript.Quit 0
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Known errors ===
* &lt;font color=red&gt;Error 500 ''Server error!''&lt;/font&gt;: replace a &lt;code&gt;Deny from all&lt;/code&gt; by a &lt;code&gt;Allow from all&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;font color=red&gt;Error 403 ''Forbidden access''&lt;/font&gt;: impossible to list this folder, so call directly its files.
* If the file source code is appearing in the navigator: the .htaccess is not properly set.
* &lt;font color=red&gt;''couldn't create child process''&lt;/font&gt;: replace the path after [[wikt:shebang|shebang]]. For example: 
*:&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/perl&lt;/code&gt; par &lt;code&gt;#!c:/perl/perl/bin/perl.exe -w&lt;/code&gt;.
*:&lt;code&gt;#!/usr/bin/env python&lt;/code&gt; par &lt;code&gt;#!C:\Program Files (x86)\Python\python.exe&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;font color=red&gt;''End of script output before headers''&lt;/font&gt;: missing header (eg: move the importation before &lt;code&gt;print &quot;Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8&quot;&lt;/code&gt;). But it can also be the symptom of a compilation error in the script language.
* &lt;font color=red&gt;''malformed header from script: Bad header:''&lt;/font&gt; : the header is not adapted (eg: replace &lt;code&gt;#print &quot;Content-Type: text/plain;charset=utf-8&quot;&lt;/code&gt; by &lt;code&gt;print &quot;Content-type: text/html\n\n&quot;&lt;/code&gt; if there is a &lt;code&gt;print &quot;&lt;html&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; after).

Otherwise consult the Apache logs...

Quiteunusual, or anybody else, could you add 'pornhub' to the spam blacklist?  Or tell me how to do so as I'm not quite sure. Thanks.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:28, 27 March 2014 (UTC)

: I'd never dealt with the blacklist, but with a bit of hunting I see the page is [[MediaWiki:Spam-blacklist]], and the documentation for it, such as it is, is [[mw:Extension:SpamBlacklist]].
: The page is divided up into sections according to which admin add the entries.
: Pretty much every entry starts and ends with &quot;\b&quot;, which apparently means &quot;unless preceded/followed by a letter&quot;.

Once you have VirtualBox installed on your host computer --
it doesn't matter if your host OS is Linux, MacOS, or something else --
setting up an Ubuntu virtual machine is easy.

=== host operating system pre-install steps ===

* Go to http://www.ubuntu.com/ , hit the &quot;download&quot; link, and pick whichever version of Ubuntu you want to try out in a virtual machine. For example, you may want to try the 32-bit version of Desktop Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS. Download it to your host computer. This may take a few minutes -- continue with the following while it's downloading.
* Start the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager.
* Hit the starry blue &quot;New&quot; icon.
* Name the virtual machine. (Many people give woefully uncreative names like &quot;testUbuntu14&quot;)
* Choose Type: Linux
* Choose Version: Ubuntu (32 bit).
* Hit the next button a few times (default 512 MB RAM, 8 GB hard drive file -- you can make these bigger or smaller later)
* You should see an icon for your virtual machine in the left sidebar of the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager.

* (Optional: If your purpose for setting up this machine is to practice installing Ubuntu on a RAID array in a safe sandboxed environment, set up additional virtual hard drive images now under Settings &gt;&gt; Storage).

* Click on the icon for that virtual machine (&quot;testUbuntu14&quot;) and hit the big green arrow &quot;Start&quot; icon.

* Has the download finished yet? When it's done downloading, you should have a file that ends in &quot;.iso&quot;.

* The &quot;Select start-up disk&quot; window should pop up. Hit the little folder icon to bring up a file chooser, then pick the ISO image you just downloaded. If you want to try the 32-bit version of Desktop Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS, you'll choose the &quot;ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-i386.iso&quot; file and click the &quot;open&quot; button. That should close the file chooser. Then click the &quot;start&quot; button.

* A window saying something like &quot;testUbuntu14 [Running] - Oracle VM VirtualBox&quot; should pop up and take a minute or so to boot up. Eventually it should show a big &quot;Welcome&quot; window with two big options: &quot;Try Ubuntu&quot; or &quot;Install Ubuntu&quot;. We hit the &quot;Install Ubuntu&quot; option.

* (By default, we'll be running in a tiny 640x480 pixel &quot;virtual monitor&quot; window for a while -- we'll fix the screen resolution later).

=== installing inside the virtual machine ===

The previous steps created .vdi file that acts like a fresh, empty hard drive,
and now we're going to install Ubuntu on it
exactly the same we would on a physical machine with a physical fresh, empty hard drive.

* We pick the &quot;Install Ubuntu&quot;, make sure everything is checked on the &quot;Preparing to install Ubuntu&quot; screen, then hit the &quot;Continue&quot; button.

* You are at the &quot;Installation Type&quot; window, still inside the &quot;testUbuntu14 [Running] - Oracle VM VirtualBox&quot; window, right? We accept the default &quot;Erase disk and install Ubuntu&quot; and hit the &quot;Install Now&quot; button. (There's also a &quot;Encrypt&quot; option here that does full-disk encryption,&lt;ref&gt;
EFF.
[https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/11/privacy-ubuntu-1210-full-disk-encryption &quot;Privacy in Ubuntu 12.10: Full Disk Encryption&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt; and a &quot;Encrypt my home folder&quot; option&lt;ref&gt;
Dustin Kirkland.
[http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7568/1/ &quot;Ubuntu’s Encrypted Home Directory: A Canonical Approach to Data Privacy&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt; a few steps later).

* ... Continue ...

* After entering your user name and password and hitting &quot;continue&quot;, Ubuntu will take many minutes install.
* Write down that password on a sticky note. We'll need it later.

* Eventially you see the &quot;Installation Complete&quot; message. Hit the &quot;Restart Now&quot; button.

* Typically Ubuntu shows a &quot;All processes ended within 2 seconds&quot; message, with a few more obscure messages. If it appears to hang on that screen, at the top of the &quot;testUbuntu14 [Running] - Oracle VM VirtualBox&quot; window, hit the &quot;close window&quot; icon and choose &quot;Power off the machine&quot;, OK.
* Open up the Oracle VM VirtualBox manager. The &quot;testUbuntu1&quot; VM currently has the &quot;Powered Off&quot; icon, right? Select the VM, and hit the green arrow &quot;start&quot; icon.
* It may take Ubuntu a minute to boot up the first time from a cold start. (VirtualBox *should* have automatically ejected the ISO image, so you'll see a normal Ubuntu desktop with the default Ubuntu background, menu bars, etc.

* This would be a good time to hit the &quot;Software Updater&quot; icon on the left side (not to be confused with the &quot;Ubuntu Software Center&quot;), and install the latest updates.
* Hey, remember that password we wrote on a sticky note earlier? Type it in and hit the Authenticate button.
* This may take a few minutes -- minimize the Updater window and continue with the following while it's downloading and installing updates.

So, are we finished installing?

== return to the host operating system for further installation steps ==

Next we install the Guest Additions.&lt;ref&gt;
VirtualBox manual.
[https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html &quot;Guest Additions&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;

* Go back to the host operating system. At the top of the &quot;testUbuntu14 [Running] - Oracle VM VirtualBox&quot; window, choose Devices &gt;&gt; &quot;Insert Guest Additions CD image...&quot;
* (VirtualBox simulates inserting a CD into the simulated optical drive, and Ubuntu auto-mounts that CD under &quot;/media/a/&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;
Ask Ubuntu.
[http://askubuntu.com/questions/22743/how-do-i-install-guest-additions-in-a-virtualbox-vm &quot;How do I install Guest Additions in a VirtualBox VM?&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;
* When Ubuntu gives the &quot;VBOXADDITIONS... automatically started. Would you like to run it?...&quot; pop-up window, hit &quot;run&quot;.
* Hey, remember that password we wrote on a sticky note earlier? Type it in and hit the Authenticate button.
* Ubuntu pops up a new terminal window and takes a minute to install and start up &quot;VirtualBox Guest Additions&quot;. When the last line of that terminal window says &quot;Press Return to close this window...&quot;, click inside that window and press Return.

* Go back to the host operating system. At the top of the &quot;testUbuntu14 [Running] - Oracle VM VirtualBox&quot; window, most people find it convenient to enable Devices &gt;&gt; Shared Clipboard &gt;&gt; Bidirectional.

* Shut down the virtual machine from the &quot;gear&quot; icon in the upper right corner, &quot;Shut down...&quot; &gt;&gt; Shut Down.
* Open up the Oracle VM VirtualBox manager. The &quot;testUbuntu1&quot; VM currently has the &quot;Powered Off&quot; icon, right? Select the VM, and hit the green arrow &quot;start&quot; icon.
* (The next time you restart after installing the guest additions, the &quot;virtual monitor&quot; window should now be 800x600 pixels).

* (Now when you look under &quot;/media/a/&quot;, the &quot;Guest Additions CD image&quot; is still there -- do I need to do something to &quot;take it out of the (virtual) drive&quot;? If so, how?)

* (optional) To automagically resize the size of the virtual monitor to fill the &quot;testUbuntu14 [Running] - Oracle VM VirtualBox&quot; window whenever you stretch or shrink that window,
** At the top of the &quot;testUbuntu14 [Running] - Oracle VM VirtualBox&quot; window, choose View &gt;&gt; Auto-resize Guest Display.
** When you installed the Guest Additions (as described above), that option should have been enabled. There is apparently two separate bugs that can keep it greyed out even after installing the Guest Additions and rebooting:&lt;ref&gt;
VirtualBox bug tracker.
[https://www.virtualbox.org/ticket/1591 &quot;Ticket #1591 (closed defect: fixed)&quot;: &quot;auto-resize guest display is greyed out&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=5836082 &quot;virtualbox resolution above 800x600&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;
** Some people suggest editing a &quot;&lt;code&gt;/etc/X11/xorg.conf&lt;/code&gt;&quot; file, but that file apparently no longer exists in Ubuntu14.
** Some people suggest using apt-get to (re)install guest additions, uninstalling that version, and then re-install the guest additions again from the VirtualBox ISO:&lt;ref&gt;
[http://blog.coolaj86.com/articles/screen-resolution-virtualbox-guest-additions-ubuntu-and-you.html &quot;Screen Resolution, VirtualBox Guest Additions, Ubuntu, and You&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;
*** Inside the virtual machine, open a terminal window and run &quot;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get install build-essential dkms virtualbox-guest-additions-iso&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Hit &quot;y&quot; to continue.
*** Next, uninstall the guest additions: &quot;&lt;code&gt;sudo apt-get remove --purge virtualbox-guest-additions-iso&lt;/code&quot;. (We only installed it to pick up a bunch of dependencies; it's probably the wrong version for whatever version of VirtualBox you have running on your host).
*** At the top of the &quot;testUbuntu14 [Running] - Oracle VM VirtualBox&quot; window, choose Devices &gt;&gt; &quot;Insert Guest Additions CD image...&quot; and re-install it, as described above.
*** Reboot
*** wait a minute until the GUI desktop comes up
*** At the top of the &quot;testUbuntu14 [Running] - Oracle VM VirtualBox&quot; window, choose View &gt;&gt; Auto-resize Guest Display.


== A few things you can do with this virtual machine ==



If your purpose for setting up this machine is to practice administering RAID arrays -- setting up a new RAID array, failing, operating while degraded, adding empty hard drives to the array, rebuilding, scrubbing, etc. -- in a safe sandboxed environment, you can add and remove additional virtual hard drive images at any time under Settings &gt;&gt; Storage.



You can easily move this virtual machine to some other computer --
even a computer running a completely different host operating system.
(One exception: 64-bit Ubuntu will not run on 32-bit hardware.
32-bit Ubuntu, however, runs fine on both 64-bit Intel processors and 32-bit Intel processors.)

An operating system inside a virtual machine may see several hard drives.
Typically they are all actually &quot;.vdi&quot; files stored on a single host hard drive.
But some people tweak the VirtualBox settings so that the operating system can directly access (perhaps in read-only mode) physical drive(s),
so the hard drive that guest operating system sees is, in fact, a physical hard drive.

Many people disable the &quot;fading windows&quot; effect and other pretty effects by installing &quot;CompizConfig Settings Manager&quot; and turning off &quot;effects&quot; and &quot;Enhanced Zoom Desktop&quot;.

Many people install and use a &quot;fast, lightweight&quot; window manager such as
GNOME Flashback (Metacity)&lt;ref&gt;
Pjotr.
[https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/first &quot;Do this first in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
or
XFCE,&lt;ref&gt;
Pjotr.
[https://sites.google.com/site/easylinuxtipsproject/alternative &quot;Turn Ubuntu 14.04 into Xubuntu 14.04&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people install zRam for better performance with limited RAM.
This is a single command in Ubuntu 12.04 and newer: open a terminal window, and run&lt;ref&gt;
Andrew.
[http://www.webupd8.org/2011/10/increased-performance-in-linux-with.html &quot;Increased performance in Linux with zRAM (virtual swap compressed in RAM)&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
    sudo apt-get install zram-config

== Using ssh to access an Ubuntu virtual machine ==

Inside the virtual machine window, you can open a terminal window and
ssh to some other server -- that's all installed by default.

Often people want to access a text terminal on an Ubuntu server from a Windows box -- that takes a few more steps:&lt;ref&gt;
Ubuntu.
[https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring &quot;SSH/OpenSSH/Configuring&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://ubuntuhandbook.org/index.php/2014/04/enable-ssh-ubuntu-14-04-trusty-tahr/ &quot;Enable SSH in Ubuntu 14.04 Trusty Tahr&quot;].
&lt;/ref&gt;

* Make sure the openssh-server is installed:
** Open the Ubuntu Software Center from the left sidebar, type &quot;openssh-server&quot; in the search sidebar, and click the install button.
OR
** Open a terminal window from the left sidebar, and run the command

    sudo apt-get install openssh-server

* Edit the config file

    sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config

* Find the line that says &quot;PasswordAuthentication&quot;, and make sure it says

    PasswordAuthentication no

then save that file and exit.

* restart the ssh server

    sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart

* Install PuTTY on the Windows box. (This works more-or-less the same as the &quot;ssh&quot; command installed by default in Ubuntu).

* Get the IP address of the Ubuntu box: At the top of the virtual screen there's an icon that allegedly looks like an internet connection; pull it down and choose &quot;Connection information&quot;.

* Most likely the IP address will begin with &quot;10.&quot; or &quot;192.&quot;, a local address that is not usable outside the local network.

* ''(FIXME: is this really the Right Thing to Do?)'' In the Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager, select the virtual machine, choose the big yellow gear &quot;Settings&quot;, choose &quot;Network&quot; on the left side, and change the &quot;Attached to:&quot; from &quot;NAT&quot; to &quot;Bridged Adapter&quot;, and hit OK.

* Get the IP address of the Ubuntu box again: At the top of the virtual screen there's an icon that allegedly looks like an internet connection; pull it down and choose &quot;Connection information&quot;. (This will almost certainly be a different IP address than the one you saw before enabling &quot;Bridged Adapter&quot;).

* Run PuTTY on the Windows box, and type the &quot;Bridged Adapter&quot; IP address in the &quot;Host Name or IP address&quot; box, and hit Enter.

You should be able to log into the virtual machine now.

!&lt;/b&gt;In this section, we'll begin a more focused practice on the use of adverbs.  Adverbs, or verb descriptors, typically follow a uniform formula for creating -ly adverbs based on the root.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
Generally, to create -ly adjectives, you take the root word followed by -mente.
For example:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width =&quot;55%&quot; border = 0 font-size=&quot;12pt&quot;
&lt;center&gt;

|-
|width &quot;20pt&quot; |silenciosa [quiet] &lt;br&gt;
|width &quot;20pt&quot; |silenciosamente [quietly]&lt;br&gt;
| El hombre camina silenciosamente en la biblioteca.
|-
|width &quot;20pt&quot;|rapido [quick] &lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many ways that a user interface can react to mouse events. The most commonly used mouse events are:
* Mouse click. Used for following a link, activating an icon, or selecting an item.
* Double click. Used mostly for opening a program or highlighting a word.
* Triple click. Highlights a paragraph of text.
* Right click. Used for opening a context menu.
* Middle button click. Rarely used because not all mice have three buttons.
* Scroll wheel. Used for scrolling text. Not all mice have scroll wheels, but they are much used if present.
* Mouse-over (hover). Used mostly for changing the mouse cursor on objects that can be manipulated and for showing pop-up descriptions about objects.
* Mouse drag. Used mostly for moving objects or boundaries.
* Highlight by moving mouse with button down. Used for selecting text.
* Shift key + click. Extends selection.
* Ctrl key + click. Selects multiple items.
Most of these effects are not visible, and only proficient users are aware of all of them. However, it is good to support these effects because users may expect them to work.

Many user interfaces, such as office programs and websites, are so crowded with mouse effects that it is difficult to avoid activating them inadvertently. A user may click in a window just to move the focus to that window or place the cursor. But sometimes it can be difficult to find a place to click that doesn't do anything else than that.

Double clicking is inconvenient for many users and may be replaced by a middle button click (see [[Usability_for_Nerds/Hardware/Mouse|Mouse]]).

Mouse-over effects can be very disturbing, especially if the user interface is so crowded that it is difficult to find a place to put the mouse that doesn't do anything. A good alternative is to make a right-click context menu with a ''&quot;What's this&quot;'' option.

[[File:Right click whats this menu.gif|center|Right click what's this menu]]


A mouse-over effect is useful when it changes the mouse cursor to indicate a link that can be clicked or a border than can be dragged. This effect should be immediate. But the mouse-over effect that pops up a message should be delayed for approximately one second in order to avoid too much flickering. 

[[File:Mouse over help.gif|center|Mouse over popup message]]


The mouse-over effect may change the color of a link or underline it, but never change the font size. Any mouse-over effect that changes the size of an object can cause everything below the resized object to move, which makes the whole image flicker when the mouse is moved around. This is very disturbing.

Some programs have additional mouse effects that are disturbing. Clicking on a filename in Windows will select the file. But if the file is already selected, the click will rename the file. This is unexpected and may lead to inadvertent renaming of files. Some word processors will pop up a context menu when a word is highlighted with the mouse. This is disturbing because it covers some of the text. Often a user will highlight a word just to use it as a fixation point to the eye. Any side effect of highlighting the word is unwanted in this case.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Novice users tend to use the mouse for most commands, clicking on self-explaining menus and icons. Experienced users, on the other hand, often prefer to use keyboard commands for several reasons:
* Mouse operations require that the hand is moved back and forth between keyboard and mouse.
* Heavy use of a mouse can cause strain injuries.
* Using keyboard shortcuts is faster than using the mouse if the key combination is remembered

The current trend towards ever more fanciful graphical user interfaces that rely more on mouse effects and less on the keyboard is bad for heavy users (and very bad for people with impaired vision and other handicaps). In principle, all operations should have both a mouse command and a keyboard command.

The main problem with keyboard shortcuts is that they are not visible. Keyboard shortcuts should be indicated on the corresponding menus wherever this is possible.

[[File:Menu_(computing)_example.PNG|center|Drop down menu with indication of keyboard shortcuts]]

It is important that shortcut keys are standardized as much as possible. The user is more likely to remember a keyboard shortcut if it uses the same key combination in all software programs. Every program that has some kind of text editing, even if it is just a small text field in a dialog box, should use the same keyboard shortcuts for moving the cursor, highlighting text, copy and paste, etc. It would be inconvenient if every program that has a dialog box for entering a user name or a file name should have a help item telling how to copy and paste a word, and the user would be unlikely to read it. The programmer should always use standard library solutions for text editing fields, file dialogs, etc. in order to get the standard behavior and the standard shortcut keys.

The keyboard shortcuts should be the same in all programs and on all platforms and operating systems as far as possible. There are various pages on the web listing common standard shortcut key combinations. See e.g.

* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_of_keyboard_shortcuts Table of Keyboard Shortcuts on Wikipedia]
* [http://www.lib.uom.gr/accelerate/ttu_en/keys_general.html General Shortcut Keys, University of Macedonia, Greece]
* [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/keyboard-shortcuts Keyboard Shortcuts, Microsoft Windows]

Deviations from the standard behavior are annoying. In Gnome Gedit, for example, Ctrl+RightArrow moves the cursor to the next end of a word while in most other programs it moves the cursor to the next beginning of a word.

Some software programs have different shortcut keys depending on the language version. For example, Microsoft Office uses Ctrl+B for making text '''bold''' in the English language version, and different letters in other language versions depending on what &lt;u&gt;b&lt;/u&gt;oldface is called in that language. This is very unfortunate because people may switch between different language versions. In today's globalized world, people may travel and work in different countries, or they may use different language versions of the same program for a number of reasons.

Sometimes, there are multiple standard keys for the same operation. For example, ''Cut'', ''Copy'' and ''Paste'' can be Ctrl+X, Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V, respectively, or Shift+Del, Ctrl+Ins and Shift+Ins, respectively. It is important to support both standards because different users may have different habits. The latter standard is more convenient for heavy users because it makes it possible to select and edit text without moving the hands. The Del and Ins keys are close to the arrow keys used for highlighting the text to edit. A user who often does a lot of text editing is likely to learn these keystrokes so that they can edit text with the left hand on the Ctrl and Shift keys and the right hand on the Ins, Del and arrow keys and never move their eyes from the screen.

Mackerel is a common fish.  It is an oily fish with rich of omega-3.  

mackerel shih charngjiahn yourxihng yur, harn fengfuh omega-3.  

----

The flesh of mackerel spoils easily, especially in the tropics, and can cause food poisoning.

==IRate==
Describes a range of rates supported by the [[#ITelescopeV3|ITelescopeV3.MoveAxis()]] method (degrees/per second)  These are contained within an IAxisRates collection and serve to describe one or more supported ranges of rates of motion about a mechanical axis.   It is possible that the IRate.Maximum and IRate.Minimum properties will be equal. In this case, the IRate object expresses a single discrete rate.   Both the IRate.Minimum  and IRate.Maximum  properties are always expressed in units of degrees per second.  This is only using for Telescope InterfaceVersions 2 and 3

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How to plan your game out ==
''This a rough guide for you to follow when you're planning your game out.''

* Break your planning note document into different levels of indentation, for example: plan a world, then increase your indentation to plan the level, then increase your indentation to plan each part of the level, then increase the indentation to plan the aesthetics of that part. Note: if the document gets too large, it might be a good idea to swap a level of indentation into a different file or directory.
* Plan with images, this will help you and others visualise what you mean to get a better understanding.
* Plan out:
** Mechanics
** Worlds/locations/levels
** Aesthetics
** Character
*** Movement
*** Inventory
*** Attacks
** GUI
** Storyline/objectives

== Things to think about when you plan a new feature ==
* &quot;Replayability&quot;
:: Is this new feature worth replaying?
* Enjoyment
:: Is this new feature fun?
* Understandable
:: How easy is it for someone to pick up?
* Unique
:: How unique is this feature? Is it typical and too expected?
* Hard or frustrating?
:: It's good for games to be hard, it can make it challenging, but no one wants to play a frustrating game.

      <text xml:space="preserve">

ایک مرتبہ طاؤس یمانی نے حضرت کی خدمت میں حاضر ہو کر یہ سوال کیا کہ وہ کونسی چیز ہے جس کا تھوڑا استعمال حلال تھا اور زیادہ استعمال حرام ،
آپ نے فرمایا کہ وہ نہرطالوت کا پانی تھا جس کا صرف ایک چلو پینا حلال تھا اور اس سے زیادہ حرام -

پوچھا ! وہ کون سا روزہ تھا جس میں کھانا پینا جائز تھا ،
فرمایا ! و ہ جناب مریم کا روزہ صمت تھا جس میں صرف نہ بولنے کا روزہ تھا مگر کھانا پینا حلال تھا ،

پوچھا ! وہ کون سی شئے ہے جو صرف (خرچ) کرنے سے کم ہوتی ہے بڑھتی نہیں ، فرمایا کہ وہ عمر ہے ۔

پوچھا ! وہ کون سی شئے ہے جو بڑھتی ہے گھٹتی نہیں ،
فرمایا ! وہ سمندر کا پانی ہے ،

پوچھا ! وہ کونسی چیز ہے جوصرف ایک بار اڑی پھر نہ اڑی ،
فرمایا ! وہ کوہ طور ہے جوایک بار حکم خدا سے اڑ کر بنی اسرائیل کے سروں پر آگیا تھا ۔

پوچھا ! وہ کون لوگ ہیں جن کی سچی گواہی خدا نے جھوٹی قراردی ،
فرمایا ! وہ منافقوں کی تصدیق رسالت ہے جو دل سے نہ تھی۔

پوچھا ! بنی آدم کا ۱/۳ حصہ کب ہلاک ہوا ،
فرمایا ! ایسا کبھی نہیں ہوا ، تم یہ پوچھو کہ انسان کا ۱/۴ حصہ کب ہلاک ہوا تو میں بتاؤں کہ یہ اس وقت ہوا جب قابیل نے ہابیل کو قتل کیا ، کیونکہ اس وقت چار آدمی تھے آدم ، حوا ، ہابیل اور قابیل ،

پوچھا ! پھرنسل انسانی کس طرح بڑھی -
فرمایا ! جناب شیت سے جو قتل ہابیل کے بعد بطن حوا سے پیدا ہوئے ۔

پوچھا ! وہ کونسی صلواۃ ھے جو بغیر وضو کے فرض ھے -
فرمایا ! وہ آل محمد (ص) پر صلوٰٰۃ ھے -

.اللَّهُمَّ صَلِّ عَلَى مُحَمَّدٍ وآلِ مُحَمَّدٍ وعَجِّلْ فَرَجَهُمْ …

NGREDIENTS
CAKE:
3 large eggs
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup selfraising flour
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract
COCONUT CREAM FILLING:
2 cups milk
1 1/2 cups sugar
2 cups coconut milk
4 large yolks (reserve whites for meringue)
3/4 cup sweetened, shredded coconut
1/3 cup cornstarch
CAKE SYRUP:
1/2 cup coconut milk
1/4 cup coconut rum
MERINGUE:
4 large egg whites
12 tablespoon sugar

DIRECTIONS

To make the cake: Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter a 9 by 13-inch cake pan. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the eggs and sugar until pale and fluffy. Add the flour, baking powder, and vanilla extract; mix until just combined. Transfer the batter to the prepared pan. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center tests clean. Cool completely on a wire rack. Meanwhile, make coconut cream filling. 

For the coconut cream filling: In a large bowl, whisk together sugar, coconut milk, yolks, shredded coconut and cornstarch. In a large saucepan, combine milk and remaining cup sugar; heat over medium until sugar dissolves and milk is steaming. Gradually whisk the hot milk into egg mixture; return the custard mixture to the saucepan. Cook, stirring, until custard thickens, 3 to 4 minutes. Pour the custard into a heat-proof bowl. Cover the surface directly with the plastic wrap. Set aside to cool completely, about 1 hour (or up to overnight in the refrigerator). While coconut cream and cake cool, make cake syrup 

For the simple syrup: Combine water and sugar in a medium saucepan; bring to a boil. Transfer to a bowl with coconut milk and rum; stir to combine. 

For the meringue: Combine sugar and water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar, for 4 minutes. In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat the egg whites and remaining 1 tablespoon sugar. With the motor running, gradually beat in the syrup mixture in a slow, steady stream. 

To assemble the cake: Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Use a serrated knife to cut cake crosswise into 2 layers. Brush the bottom layer with syrup and spread with coconut cream. Add the second cake layer and repeat with syrup and coconut cream. Spread the meringue over the cake. Transfer the cake to the oven for 2 to 3 minutes or until the meringue is toasted.

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

This article examines the concepts of the ''function'' and the ''relation''.

A '''relation''' is any association between elements of one set, called the '''domain''', or (less formally) the &quot;set of inputs&quot;; and another set, called the '''codomain''' or '''range'''—but beware, these names are ''not'' entirely synonymous, as we will see in a moment—or &quot;set of possible outputs&quot;.

The word ''possible'' here is ''not'' so important for relations, because ''both'' the domain and range of relations can include elements that are ''never associated with anything''.  (It is more important for functions, as we will see.)  However, we sometimes wish to discuss only those elements of the codomain (or range) which ''are'' associated with at least one thing from the domain.  So, how do we refer to this &quot;set of ''actual'' outputs&quot;?  The answer depends on whether we used ''codomain'' or ''range'' above:

* If you call the &quot;set of possible outputs&quot; ''codomain'', as we usually do here, then ''range'' is still available; so we call the possible outputs the ''codomain'', and the actual outputs the '''range'''.

* If you use ''range'' for &quot;set of possible outputs&quot;, then you need another word for &quot;set of actual outputs&quot;: the most common one is '''image'''.

Note that, in either case, we have one term that is unnecessary (''codomain'' or ''image'') and one word that is ambiguous (''range'').  So neither choice is much &quot;better&quot; than the other, but we have to pick one and stick with it to avoid confusion.  Again, we typically choose the former.

For example, if the ''domain'' is a set ''Fruits'' = {apples, oranges, bananas} and the ''codomain'' is a set ''Flavors'' = {sweetness, tartness, bitterness}, the flavors of these fruits form a relation: we might say that apples are related to (or associated with) ''both'' sweetness and tartness, while oranges are related to tartness only and bananas to sweetness only.  (We might disagree on the actual flavors somewhat, but that is irrelevant to the topic of this book.)  Notice that &quot;bitterness&quot;, although it is one of the possible ''Flavors'' (codomain), is not really used for any of these relationships; so it is not part of the ''range'' (or ''image'') {sweetness, tartness}.

Another way of looking at this is to say that a relation is a ''subset of ordered pairs'' drawn from the ''set of all possible ordered pairs'' (of elements of two other sets, which we normally refer to as the ''Cartesian product'' of those sets).  Formally, ''R'' is a relation if

: ''R'' ⊆ ''X'' × ''Y'' = {(''x'', ''y'') | ''x'' ∈ ''X'', ''y'' ∈ ''Y''}

for the domain ''X'' and codomain ''Y''.  The '''inverse relation''' of ''R'', which is written as ''R''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, is what we get when we interchange the ''X'' and ''Y'' values:

: ''R''&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = {(''y'', ''x'') | (''x'', ''y'') ∈ ''R''}

'''''END OF FINISHED WORK'''''

Using the example above, we can write the relation in set notation: {(apples, sweetness), (apples, tartness), (oranges, tartness), (bananas, sweetness)}.  The inverse relation, which we could describe as &quot;fruits of a given flavor&quot;, is {(sweetness, apples), (sweetness, bananas), (tartness, apples), (tartness, oranges)}.  (Here, as elsewhere, the order of elements in a set has no significance.)

One important kind of relation is the ''function''.  A '''''function''''' is a relation that has '''exactly one output''' for every possible input '''in the domain'''.  (The domain does not necessarily have to include all possible objects of a given type.  In fact, we sometimes intentionally use a ''restricted domain'' in order to satisfy some desirable property.)  The relations discussed above (flavors of fruits and fruits of a given flavor) are '''not''' functions: the first has two possible outputs for the input &quot;apples&quot; (sweetness and tartness); and the second has two outputs for both &quot;sweetness&quot; (apples and bananas) and &quot;tartness&quot; (apples and oranges).

The main reason for not allowing multiple outputs with the same input is that it lets us apply the same function to different forms of the same thing without changing their equivalence.  That is, if f is a function with a (or b) in its domain, then a = b implies that f(a) = f(b).  For example, z - 3 = 5 implies that z = 8 because f(x) = x + 3 is a function defined for all numbers x.

The converse, that f(a) = f(b) implies a = b, is not always true.  When it is, there is never more than one ''input'' x for a certain ''output'' y = f(x).  This is the same as the definition of function, but with the roles of X and Y interchanged; so it means the ''inverse relation'' f&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; '''must also''' be a function.  In general—regardless of whether or not the original relation was a function—the inverse relation will ''sometimes'' be a function, and sometimes not.

When f and f&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; are both functions, they are called '''''one-to-one''''', '''''injective''''', or '''''invertible functions'''''.  This is one of two very important properties a function f might (or might not) have; the other property is called '''''onto''''' or '''''surjective''''', which means, for any y ∈ Y (in the codomain), there is some x ∈ X (in the domain) such that f(x) = y.  In other words, a ''surjective'' function f ''maps onto'' every possible output '''at least once'''.

A function can be '''neither''' one-to-one nor onto, '''both''' one-to-one and onto (in which case it is also called '''''bijective''''' or a '''''one-to-one correspondence'''''), or just one and not the other.  (As an example which is neither, consider f = {(0,2), (1,2)}.  It is a function, since there is only one y value for each x value; but there is more than one input x for the output y = 2; and it clearly does not &quot;map onto&quot; all integers.)

== Relations ==
In the above section dealing with functions and their properties, we noted the important property that all functions must have, namely that if a function does map a value from its domain to its co-domain, it must map this value to only one value in the co-domain.

Writing in set notation, if ''a'' is some fixed value:
: |{f(x)|x=a}| ∈ {0, 1}

The literal reading of this statement is: the ''cardinality'' (number of elements) of the set of all values f(x), such that x=a for some fixed value a, is an element of the set {0, 1}.  In other words, the number of ''outputs'' that a function f may have at any fixed ''input'' a is either zero (in which case it is ''undefined'' at that input) or one (in which case the output is unique).

However, when we consider the ''relation'', we relax this constriction, and so a relation may map one value to more than one other value. In general, a relation is '''any''' subset of the Cartesian product of its domain and co-domain.

All functions, then, can be considered as relations also.

=== Notations === 
When we have the property that one value is related to another, we call this relation a ''binary relation'' and we write it as
: x R y
where R is the relation.

For arrow diagrams and set notations, remember for relations we do not have the restriction that functions do and we can draw an arrow to represent the mappings, and for a set diagram, we need only write all the ordered pairs that the relation does take: again, by example
:f = {(0,0),(1,1),(1,-1),(2,2),(2,-2)} 
is a relation and not a function, since both 1 and 2 are mapped to two values, 1 and -1, and 2 and -2 respectively)
example let A=2,3,5;B=4,6,9 then
A*B=(2,4),(2,6),(2,9),(3,4),(3,6),(3,9),(5,4),(5,6),(5,9)
Define a relation R=(2,4),(2,6),(3,6),(3,9)
add functions and problems to one another

=== Some simple examples ===
Let us examine some simple relations.

Say f is defined by
: {(0,0),(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(1,2),(2,3),(3,1),(2,1),(3,2),(1,3)}

This is a relation (not a function) since we can observe that 1 maps to 2 and 3, for instance.


Less-than, &quot;&lt;&quot;, is a relation also. Many numbers can be less than some other fixed number, so it cannot be a function.

=== Properties ===
When we are looking at relations, we can observe some special properties different relations can have.

==== Reflexive ====
A relation is ''reflexive'' if, we observe that for all values a:
: ''a'' R ''a''
In other words, all values are related to themselves.

The relation of equality, &quot;=&quot; is reflexive. Observe that for, say, all numbers a (the domain is '''R'''):
: ''a'' = ''a''
so &quot;=&quot; is reflexive.

In a reflexive relation, we have arrows for all values in the domain pointing back to themselves:
:[[Image:Arrow diagram reflexive.png]]

Note that ≤ is also reflexive (a ≤ a for any a in '''R'''). On the other hand, the relation &lt; is not (a &lt; a is false for any a in '''R''').

==== Symmetric ====
A relation is ''symmetric'' if, we observe that for all values of a and b:
: ''a'' R ''b'' implies ''b'' R ''a''

The relation of equality again is symmetric. If ''x''=''y'', we can also write that ''y''=''x'' also.

In a symmetric relation, for each arrow we have also an opposite arrow, i.e. there is either no arrow between ''x'' and ''y'', or an arrow points from ''x'' to  ''y'' and an arrow back from ''y'' to ''x'':
:[[Image:Arrow diagram symmetric.png]]

Neither ≤ nor &lt; is symmetric (2 ≤ 3 and 2 &lt; 3  but neither 3 ≤ 2 nor 3 &lt; 2 is true).

==== Transitive ====
A relation is ''transitive'' if for all values ''a'', ''b'', ''c'':
: ''a'' R ''b'' and ''b'' R ''c'' implies ''a'' R ''c''

The relation ''greater-than'' &quot;&gt;&quot; is transitive. If ''x'' &gt; ''y'', and ''y'' &gt; ''z'', then it is true that ''x'' &gt; ''z''. This becomes clearer when we write down what is happening into words. ''x'' is greater than ''y'' and ''y'' is greater than ''z''. So ''x'' is greater than both ''y'' and ''z''.

The relation ''is-not-equal'' &quot;≠&quot; is not transitive. If ''x'' ≠ ''y'' and ''y'' ≠ ''z'' then we might have ''x'' = ''z'' or ''x'' ≠ ''z'' (for example 1 ≠ 2 and 2 ≠ 3 and 1 ≠ 3 but 0 ≠ 1 and 1 ≠ 0 and 0 = 0). 

In the arrow diagram, every arrow between two values ''a'' and ''b'', and ''b'' and ''c'', has an arrow going straight from ''a'' to ''c''.
:[[Image:Arrow diagram transitive.png]]

==== Antisymmetric ====
A relation is ''antisymmetric'' if we observe that for all values ''a'' and ''b'':
: ''a'' R ''b'' and ''b'' R ''a'' implies that ''a''=''b''
'''Notice that antisymmetric is not the same as &quot;not symmetric.&quot;'''

Take the relation ''greater than or equal to'', &quot;&amp;ge;&quot;
If ''x'' &amp;ge; ''y'', and ''y'' &amp;ge; x, then ''y'' must be equal to ''x''.
a relation is anti-symmetric if and only if a∈A, (a,a)∈R

==== Trichotomy ====
A relation satisfies ''trichotomy'' if we observe that for all values ''a'' and ''b'' it holds true that:
''a''R''b'' ''or'' ''b''R''a''

The relation ''is-greater-or-equal'' satisfies since, given 2 real numbers ''a'' and ''b'', it is true that whether ''a'' ≥ ''b'' or ''b'' ≥ ''a'' (both if ''a'' = ''b'').

==== Problem set ==== 
Given the above information, determine which relations are reflexive, transitive, symmetric, or antisymmetric on the following - there may be more than one characteristic. (Answers follow.)
''x'' R ''y'' if 
# x = y
# x &lt; y
# x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
# x &amp;le; y

===== Answers =====
#Symmetric, Reflexive,and Antisymmetric
#Transitive, Antisymmetric
#Symmetric, Reflexive, and Antisymmetric (x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is just a special case of equality, so all properties that apply to x = y also apply to this case)
#Reflexive, and Antisymmetric (and satisfying Trichotomy)

=== Equivalence relations ===
We have seen that certain common relations such as &quot;=&quot;, and congruence (which we will deal with in the next section) obey some of these rules above. The relations we will deal with are very important in discrete mathematics, and are known as ''equivalence relations''. They essentially assert some kind of equality notion, or ''equivalence'', hence the name.

==== Characteristics of equivalence relations ====
For a relation R to be an ''equivalence relation'', it must have the following properties, viz. R must be:
* symmetric
* transitive
* reflexive
(A helpful mnemonic, S-T-R)

In the previous problem set you have shown equality, &quot;=&quot;, to be reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. So &quot;=&quot; is an equivalence relation.

We denote an equivalence relation, in general, by &lt;math&gt;x \sim y&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Example proof ====
Say we are asked to prove that &quot;=&quot; is an equivalence relation.
We then proceed to prove each property above in turn (Often, the proof of transitivity is the hardest).

* '''Reflexive''': Clearly, it is true that ''a'' = ''a'' for all values a.  Therefore, = is reflexive.
* '''Symmetric''': If ''a'' = ''b'', it is also true that ''b'' = ''a''.  Therefore, = is symmetric
* '''Transitive''':  If ''a'' = ''b'' and ''b'' = ''c'', this says that ''a'' is the same as ''b'' which in turn is the same as ''c''. So ''a'' is then the same as ''c'', so ''a''  = ''c'', and thus = is transitive.

Thus = is an equivalence relation.

==== Partitions and equivalence classes ====
It is true that when we are dealing with relations, we may find that many values are related to one fixed value. 

For example, when we look at the quality of ''congruence'', which is that given some number ''a'', a number congruent to ''a'' is one that has the same remainder or ''modulus'' when divided by some number ''n'', as ''a'', which we write
:a &amp;equiv; b (mod n)
and is the same as writing
:''b'' = ''a''+''kn'' for some integer k.
(We will look into congruences in further detail later, but a simple examination or understanding of this idea will be interesting in its application to equivalence relations)

For example, 2 &amp;equiv; 0 (mod 2), since the remainder on dividing 2 by 2 is in fact 0, as is the remainder on dividing 0 by 2.

We can show that congruence is an equivalence relation (This is left as an exercise, below '''Hint''' use the equivalent form of congruence as described above).

However, what is more interesting is that we can group all numbers that are equivalent to each other. 

With the relation congruence ''modulo'' 2 (which is using n=2, as above), or more formally:
: x ~ y if and only if x &amp;equiv; y (mod 2)
we can group all numbers that are equivalent to each other. Observe:
: &lt;math&gt;0 \equiv 2 \equiv 4 \equiv \ldots \pmod{2}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;1 \equiv 3 \equiv 5 \equiv \ldots \pmod{2}&lt;/math&gt;
This first equation above tells us all the ''even'' numbers are equivalent to each other under ~, and all the ''odd'' numbers under ~.

We can write this in set notation. However, we have a special notation.
We write:
:[0]={0,2,4,...}
:[1]={1,3,5,...}

and we call these two sets ''equivalence classes''.

All elements in an equivalence class by definition are equivalent to each other, and thus note that we do not need to include [2], since 2 ~ 0.

We call the act of doing this 'grouping' with respect to some equivalence relation ''partitioning'' (or further and explicitly ''partitioning a set S into equivalence classes under a relation ~''). Above, we have partitioned '''Z''' into equivalence classes [0] and [1], under the relation of congruence modulo 2.

==== Problem set ====
Given the above, answer the following questions on equivalence relations (Answers follow to even numbered questions)
# Prove that congruence is an equivalence relation as before (See hint above).
# Partition {x | 1 &amp;le; x &amp;le; 9} into equivalence classes under the equivalence relation 
&lt;math&gt; x \sim y\ \mbox{iff}\ x \equiv y \pmod{6}&lt;/math&gt;

===== Answers =====
2. [0]={6}, [1]={1,7}, [2]={2,8}, [3]={3,9}, [4]={4}, [5]={5}

=== Partial orders ===
We also see that &quot;&amp;ge;&quot; and &quot;&amp;le;&quot; obey some of the rules above. Are these special kinds of relations too, like equivalence relations? Yes, in fact, these relations are specific examples of another special kind of relation which we will describe in this section: the ''partial order''.

As the name suggests, this relation gives some kind of ordering to numbers.

==== Characteristics of partial orders ====
For a relation R to be a partial order, it must have the following three properties, viz R must be:
* reflexive
* antisymmetric
* transitive
(A helpful mnemonic, R-A-T)

We denote a partial order, in general, by &lt;math&gt;x \preceq y&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Question:'''
# Suppose R is a relation on a set of integers Z then prove that R is a partial order relation on Z iff a=b raise to power r.

==== Example proof ====
Say we are asked to prove that &quot;&amp;le;&quot; is a partial order.
We then proceed to prove each property above in turn (Often, the proof of transitivity is the hardest).

===== Reflexive =====
Clearly, it is true that ''a'' &amp;le; ''a'' for all values a.
So &amp;le; is reflexive.

===== Antisymmetric =====
If ''a'' &amp;le; ''b'', and ''b'' &amp;le; ''a'', then a ''must'' be equal to ''b''.
So &amp;le; is antisymmetric

===== Transitive =====
If ''a'' &amp;le; ''b'' and ''b'' &amp;le; ''c'', this says that ''a'' is less than ''b'' and ''c''. So ''a'' is less than ''c'', so ''a'' &amp;le; ''c'', and thus &amp;le; is transitive.

Thus &amp;le; is a partial order.

==== Problem set ====
Given the above on partial orders, answer the following questions
# Prove that divisibility, |, is a partial order (a | b means that a is a factor of b, i.e., on dividing b by a, no remainder results).
#  Prove the following set is a partial order: (''a'', ''b'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''c'', ''d'') implies ''ab''&amp;le;''cd'' for ''a'',''b'',''c'',''d'' integers ranging from 0 to 5. 

===== Answers =====
2. Simple proof; Formalization of the proof is an optional exercise.
:Reflexivity: (''a'', ''b'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''a'', ''b'') since ''ab''=''ab''. 
:Antisymmetric: (''a'', ''b'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''c'', ''d'') and (''c'', ''d'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''a'', ''b'') since ''ab''&amp;le;''cd'' and ''cd''&amp;le;''ab'' imply ''ab''=''cd''. 
:Transitive: (''a'', ''b'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''c'', ''d'') and (''c'', ''d'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''e'', ''f'') implies (''a'', ''b'') &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; (''e'', ''f'') since ''ab''&amp;le;''cd''&amp;le;''ef'' and thus ''ab''&amp;le;''ef''

==== Posets ====
A partial order imparts some kind of &quot;ordering&quot; amongst elements of a set. For example, we only know that 2 &amp;ge; 1 because of the partial ordering &amp;ge;.

We call a set A, ordered under a general partial ordering &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;, a ''partially ordered set'', or simply just ''poset'', and write it (A, &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;).

===== Terminology =====
There is some specific terminology that will help us understand and visualize the partial orders. 

When we have a partial order &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;, such that ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; ''b'', we write &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; to say that a &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; but ''a'' &amp;ne; ''b''. We say in this instance that a ''precedes'' b, or ''a'' is a predecessor of ''b''.

If (A, &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;) is a poset, we say that ''a'' is an immediate predecessor of ''b'' (or ''a'' immediately precedes ''b'') if there is no ''x'' in A such that ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; ''b''.

If we have the same poset, and we also have ''a'' and ''b'' in A, then we say ''a'' and ''b'' are ''comparable'' if ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; ''b'' or ''b'' &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt; ''a''. Otherwise they are ''incomparable''.

==== Hasse diagrams ====
''Hasse diagrams'' are special diagrams that enable us to visualize the structure of a partial ordering. They use some of the concepts in the previous section to draw the diagram.

A Hasse diagram of the poset (A, &lt;math&gt;\preceq&lt;/math&gt;) is constructed by
* placing elements of A as points
* if ''a'' and ''b'' &amp;isin; A, and ''a'' is an immediate predecessor of b, we draw a line from ''a'' to ''b''
* if ''a'' &lt;math&gt;\prec&lt;/math&gt; ''b'', put the point for ''a'' lower than the point for ''b''
* not drawing loops from ''a'' to ''a'' (this is assumed in a partial order because of reflexivity)

=== Operations on Relations ===

There are some useful operations one can perform on relations, which allow to 
express some of the above mentioned properties more briefly.

==== Inversion ====
Let R be a relation, then its inversion, R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is defined by

R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; := {(a,b) | (b,a) in R}.

==== Concatenation ====
Let R be a relation between the sets A and B, S be a relation between B and C. We can concatenate
these relations by defining

R &amp;bull; S := {(a,c) | (a,b) in R and (b,c) in S for some b out of B}

==== Diagonal of a Set ====
Let A be a set, then we define the diagonal (D) of A by

D(A) := {(a,a) | a in A}

==== Shorter Notations ====
Using above definitions, one can say (lets assume R is a relation between A and B):

R is ''transitive'' if and only if R &amp;bull; R is a subset of R.

R is ''reflexive'' if and only if D(A) is a subset of R.

R is ''symmetric'' if R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is a subset of R.

R is ''antisymmetric'' if and only if the intersection of R and R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is D(A).

R is ''asymmetric'' if and only if the intersection of D(A) and R is empty.

R is a ''function'' if and only if R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;bull; R is a subset of D(B).

In this case it is a function A &amp;rarr; B.
Let's assume R meets the condition of being a function, then

R is ''injective'' if R &amp;bull; R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is a subset of D(A).

R is ''surjective'' if {b | (a,b) in R} = B.

== Functions ==
A function is a relationship between two sets of numbers. We may think of this as a ''mapping''; a function ''maps'' a number in one set to a number in another set.  Notice that a function maps values to '''one and only one''' value. Two values in one set could map to one value, but one value '''must never''' map to two values: that would be a relation, ''not'' a function.

{| align=&quot;right&quot;
|-
| [[Image:Allowed_mapping_for_a_function.png]]
|}

For example, if we write (define) a function as:
: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^2&lt;/math&gt;
then we say:
:'f of x equals x squared'
and we have
: &lt;math&gt;f(-1)=1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(1)=1&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(7)=49&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(1/2)=1/4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(4)=16&lt;/math&gt;
and so on.

This function f maps numbers to their squares.

=== Range, image, codomain ===
If D is a set, we can say
: &lt;math&gt;f(D) = \{f(x) |\ x \in D\}&lt;/math&gt;

which forms a new set, called the ''range'' of f. D is called the ''domain'' of f, and represents all values that f takes. 

In general, the range of f is usually a subset of a larger set. This set is known as the ''codomain'' of a function. For example, with the function f(''x'')=cos ''x'', the range of f is [-1,1], '''but''' the codomain is the set of real numbers.

=== Notations ===
When we have a function f, with domain D and range R, we write:
:&lt;math&gt;f : D \longrightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;

If we say that, for instance, ''x'' is mapped to ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, we also can add
:&lt;math&gt;f : D \longrightarrow R;\ x \longmapsto x^2&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that we can have a function that maps a point (''x'',''y'') to a real number, or some other function of two variables -- we have a set of ordered pairs as the domain. Recall from set theory that this is defined by the ''Cartesian product'' - if we wish to represent a set of all real-valued ordered pairs we can take the Cartesian product of the real numbers with itself to obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}=\mathbb{R}^2=\{(x,y)|\ x\ \mbox{and}\ y \in\mathbb{R}\}&lt;/math&gt;.
When we have a set of ''n''-tuples as part of the domain, we say that the function is ''n''-ary (for numbers ''n''=1,2 we say unary, and binary respectively).
=== Other function notation ===
Functions can be written as above, but we can also write them in two other ways. One way is to use an arrow diagram to represent the mappings between each element. We write the elements from the domain on one side, and the elements from the range on the other, and we draw arrows to show that an element from the domain is mapped to the range.

For example, for the function f(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the arrow diagram for the domain {1,2,3} would be:
[[Image:Arrow diagram example.jpg]]

Another way is to use set notation. If f(''x'')=''y'', we can write the function in terms of its mappings. This idea is best to show in an example.

Let us take the domain D={1,2,3}, and f(''x'')=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Then, the range of f will be R={f(1),f(2),f(3)}={1,4,9}. Taking the Cartesian product of D and R we obtain F={(1,1),(2,4),(3,9)}.

So using set notation, a function can be expressed as the Cartesian product of its domain and range.
 f(''x'')
This function is called ''f'', and it takes a ''variable'' ''x''. We substitute some value for ''x'' to get the second value, which is what the function maps x to.

===Types of functions===
Functions can either be '''''one to one (injective), onto (surjective), or bijective'''''.
 
''&lt;u&gt;'''INJECTIVE Functions'''&lt;/u&gt;'' are functions in which every element in the domain maps into a unique elements in the codomain.

''&lt;u&gt;'''SURJECTIVE Functions'''&lt;/u&gt;'' are functions in which every elements in the codomain is mapped by an element in the domain.

&lt;u&gt;''''''BIJECTIVE''' Functions&lt;/u&gt;''' are functions that are both injective and surjective.</text>

In this book, I will explain how to encrypt your partitions using Linux Unified Key Setup-on-disk-format (LUKS) on your Linux based computer or laptop.&lt;br /&gt;

== Linux encryption methods ==
There are two methods to encrypt your data:

=== Filesystem stacked level encryption ===
#eCryptfs - It is a cryptographic stacked Linux filesystem. eCryptfs stores cryptographic metadata in the header of each file written, so that encrypted files can be copied between hosts; the file will be decrypted with the proper key in the Linux kernel keyring. This solution is widely used, as the basis for Ubuntu's Encrypted Home Directory, natively within Google's ChromeOS, and transparently embedded in several network attached storage (NAS) devices.
#EncFS -It provides an encrypted filesystem in user-space. It runs without any special permissions and uses the FUSE library and Linux kernel module to provide the filesystem interface. You can find links to source and binary releases below. EncFS is open source software, licensed under the GPL.

=== Block device level encryption ===
#Loop-AES - Fast and transparent file system and swap encryption package for linux. No source code changes to linux kernel. Works with 3.x, 2.6, 2.4, 2.2 and 2.0 kernels.
#Truecrypt - It is free open-source disk encryption software for Windows 7/Vista/XP, Mac OS X and Linux. '''(Deprecated)'''
#dm-crypt+LUKS - dm-crypt is a transparent disk encryption subsystem in Linux kernel v2.6+ and later and DragonFly BSD. It can encrypt whole disks, removable media, partitions, software RAID volumes, logical volumes, and files.

== Install cryptsetup utility ==
You need to install the following package. It contains cryptsetup, a utility for setting up encrypted filesystems using Device Mapper and the dm-crypt target. ''Debian / Ubuntu Linux'' user type the following ''apt-get'' command:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;# apt-get install cryptsetup&lt;/pre&gt;

Sample outputs:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap;

''RHEL / CentOS / Fedora'' Linux user type the following ''yum'' command:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;# yum install cryptsetup-luks&lt;/pre&gt;

== Configure LUKS partition ==
'''WARNING!''' The following command will remove all data on the partition that you are encrypting. You WILL lose all your information! So make sure you backup your data to an external source such as NAS or hard disk before typing any one of the following command.

In this example, I'm going to encrpt /dev/xvdc. Type the following command:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;# cryptsetup -y -v luksFormat /dev/xvdc&lt;/pre&gt;

Sample outputs:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;WARNING!
========
This will overwrite data on /dev/xvdc irrevocably.
 
Are you sure? (Type uppercase yes): YES
Enter LUKS passphrase:
Verify passphrase:
Command successful.&lt;/pre&gt;

This command initializes the volume, and sets an initial key or passphrase. Please note that the passphrase is not recoverable so do not forget it.Type the following command create a mapping:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;# cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/xvdc backup2&lt;/pre&gt;

Sample outputs:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;Enter passphrase for /dev/xvdc:&lt;/pre&gt;

You can see a mapping name /dev/mapper/backup2 after successful verification of the supplied key material which was created with luksFormat command extension:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;# ls -l /dev/mapper/backup2&lt;/pre&gt;

Sample outputs:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 7 Oct 19 19:37 /dev/mapper/backup2 -&gt; ../dm-0&lt;/pre&gt;

You can use the following command to see the status for the mapping:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;# cryptsetup -v status backup2&lt;/pre&gt;

Sample outputs:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;/dev/mapper/backup2 is active.
  type:    LUKS1
  cipher:  aes-cbc-essiv:sha256
  keysize: 256 bits
  device:  /dev/xvdc
  offset:  4096 sectors
  size:    419426304 sectors
  mode:    read/write
Command successful.&lt;/pre&gt;

You can dump LUKS headers using the following command:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;# cryptsetup luksDump /dev/xvdc&lt;/pre&gt;

== Format LUKS partition ==
First, you need to write zeros to /dev/mapper/backup2 encrypted device. This will allocate block data with zeros. This ensures that outside world will see this as random data i.e. it protect against disclosure of usage patterns:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;# dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/mapper/backup2&lt;/pre&gt;

The dd command may take many hours to complete. I suggest that you use pv command to monitor the progress:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;# pv -tpreb /dev/zero | dd of=/dev/mapper/backup2 bs=128M&lt;/pre&gt;

To create a filesystem i.e. format filesystem, enter:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;# mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/backup2&lt;/pre&gt;

To mount the new filesystem at /backup2, enter:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;# mkdir /backup2
# mount /dev/mapper/backup2 /backup2
# df -H
# cd /backup2
# ls -l&lt;/pre&gt;

== How do I unmount and secure data? ==
Type the following commands:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;# umount /backup2
# cryptsetup luksClose backup2&lt;/pre&gt;

== How do I mount or remount encrypted partition? ==
Type the following command:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;# cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/xvdc backup2
# mount /dev/mapper/backup2 /backup2
# df -H
# mount&lt;/pre&gt;

See shell script wrapper that opens LUKS partition and sets up a mapping for nas devices.

== Can I run fsck on LUKS based partition / LVM volume? ==
Yes, you can use the fsck command On LUKS based systems:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;# umount /backup2
# fsck -vy /dev/mapper/backup2
# mount /dev/mapper/backup2 /backu2&lt;/pre&gt;

See how to run fsck On LUKS (dm-crypt) based LVM physical volume for more details.

== How do I change LUKS passphrase (password) for encrypted partition? ==
Type the following command
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;### see key slots, max -8 i.e. max 8 passwords can be setup for each device ####
# cryptsetup luksDump /dev/xvdc
# cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/xvdc&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;Enter any passphrase:
Enter new passphrase for key slot:
Verify passphrase:&lt;/pre&gt;

Remove or delete the old password:
&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap; 
white-space: -moz-pre-wrap; 
white-space: -pre-wrap; 
white-space: -o-pre-wrap; 
word-wrap: break-word;&quot;&gt;# cryptsetup luksRemoveKey /dev/xvdc&lt;/pre&gt;

Please note that you need to enter the old password / passphrase.

|&lt;center&gt;Warm up: The following book is a “How To” book that shows kids how to safely have fun in New York City public parks, while maintaining the safety of all living things around them.  In six simple steps, kids will know how to enjoy the park while letting plants, animals and other people enjoy the park too. 
&lt;br&gt;
While reading the book, sort the steps into three categories. Which steps are to ensure the safety of animals? Which steps are to ensure the safety of people? Which steps are to ensure the safety of plants?

The time of each earthquake is very short, but may repeat over a long period of time.

It is the result of a sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust. This creates earthquake waves, waves of energy that travel through the Earth.

===thumbnails container===
:purpose: Filters in CM and Surveyor (searching criteria)
:''type:'' The {{TR|C|thumbnails}}.
:''field definition:'' The thumbnail(s) which are used to represent this asset in 2D preview boxes, lists, and icon form throughout the game environment (including in-game, in {{TL|references|Content Manager}}, and on the {{TL|references|Download Station}}.) Each data set is included in a sub-container using a {{TG|P|placeholder parameter}} as the key name or tag. Convention makes these 0 indexed numbers, but the value can be any non-null text value that can be evaluated as a {{TG|S|string}}.
==example one==
This example includes one root folder image, the Content Manager 240x180 required image in an common (but uncommunicative) name form.
&lt;pre&gt;
thumbnails {
	A {
		width					240
		height					180
		image					&quot;$Screenshot.jpg&quot;
	}
	}
}&lt;/pre&gt;
The above example uses an unusual, but perfectly legal 'A' dummy key-word to represent the sub-container in the thumbnails (list) {{wp|data structure}}.
&amp;nbsp;
==example two==
This example includes two root folder images, the CM 240x180 and DLS 512x512 images in an explicit picture name format. The image sub-container is the more often seen numeric dummy keyword flavor.
&lt;pre&gt;
thumbnails {
	0 {
		width					240
		height					180
		image					&quot;$Screenshot (240)(kuid 68787 25222).jpg&quot;
	}
	1 {
		width					512
		height					512
		image					&quot;$Screenshot (512)(kuid 68787 25222).jpg&quot;
	}
}&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;The instant the Sun runs out of nuclear fuel in its core, the photon pressure will disappear and the Sun's interior will collapse causing a massive explosion called a supernova which will engulf the Earth and obliterate all traces of life on it.&quot;
This isn't correct. The Sun isn't massive enough to go supernova; it will expand into a red giant, before collapsing back into a white dwarf.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Said to be 3D because of the Illusion of Depth ==

Is anyone calling photos &quot;3D images&quot;? 

Actually, people call these generated images &quot;3D&quot; to express that it was &quot;created with 3D graphics software on the computer&quot;.



== General Outline ==

The article is too chaotic.

* I would start with an introduction in the different applications such as creating 2D photo-realistic images (which is the main purpose) and animations (sequences of images) or 3D models for 3D games/simulations and other purposes like 3D printing.
* I would explain that this tutorial(?) will focus on creation of 3D models and generation of photo-realistic 2D images and others if there is more. 
* I would explain what I exactly mean by photo-realistic and thereby introduce some rendering related aspects (3D to 2D projection, light emission, shadows, reflections, textures) and mention how complex it can be (e.g. water, glas, multiple lights, multiple mirrors etc.) Reflections are actually the hardest part, because reflections cause reflections of reflections and so on. That said, it is almost impossible to achieve a result comparable to a computer rendered image of something that does not exist in reality!
* I would order the steps of the production process in some way. For example by their appearance in the production and group them by their purpose (modelling, animation and movie creation, simulation or creation of game content, etc.)</text>

I'm not sure that anything should be presented as definitively 'amateur' or definitively in 'error'. I object to these labels. Instead, the relative frequency of compositions critically regarded as successful confirming or against such rules should be discussed, with examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Process re-organization==
This should probably be re-orgnized along modern digital lines.

This would perhaps:
* segregate the physical process of imprinting the image on some media (the list currently making up the article) from the other aspects of the process

Possible steps:
* colourspace conversion
* selection of printing technique
* calculation of output size versus available source resolution
* generation of a final digital proof
* selection of paper or other media
* test prints and refinement
* potential for further artistic processes (drawing, hand-coloring, physical collage, etc.)
* drying
* sealing
* framing
* mounting

Basically there's a lot more than just the printing technology in play as far as photographic printing goes, and most of the currently listed and near-extinct techniques have little relevance today.

{{incomplete}}

= List Comprehensions =

{{requires|2014.QX|[https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues?milestone{{=}}3]}}

== Basic Syntax ==

The list comprehensions provide a flexible way to generate lists using the general syntax

  [ list-definition expression ]

The following elements are supported to construct the list definition

; for (i = sequence) : Iteration over a range or an existing list
; if (condition) : Selection criteria, when true the expression will be calculated and added to the result list
; let (x = value) : Local variable assignment

=== for ===

The for element defines the input values for the list generation, the syntax is the same as used by the [[OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Conditional and Iterator Functions#For Loop|for]] iterator.

; [ for (i = [start &amp;#58; step &amp;#58; end]) i ] : Generate output based on a range definition, this version is mainly useful to calculate list values or access existing lists using the range value as index.

'''Examples'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// generate a list with all values defined by a range
list1 = [ for (i = [0 : 2 : 10]) i ];
echo(list1); // ECHO: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// extract every second character of a string
str = &quot;SomeText&quot;;
list2 = [ for (i = [0 : 2 : len(str) - 1]) str[i] ];
echo(list2); // ECHO: [&quot;S&quot;, &quot;m&quot;, &quot;T&quot;, &quot;x&quot;]
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// indexed list access, using function to map input values to output values
function func(x) = x &lt; 1 ? 0 : x + func(x - 1);
input = [1, 3, 5, 8];
output = [for (a = [ 0 : len(input) - 1 ]) func(input[a]) ];
echo(output); // ECHO: [1, 6, 15, 36]
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

; [ for (i = [a, b, c, ...]) i ] : Use list parameter as input, this version can be used to map input values to calculated output values.

'''Examples'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// map input list to output list
list = [ for (i = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11]) i * i ];
echo(list); // ECHO: [4, 9, 25, 49, 121]
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// calculate Fibonacci numbers
function func(x) = x &lt; 3 ? 1 : func(x - 1) + func(x - 2);
input = [7, 10, 12];
output = [for (a = input) func(a) ];
echo(output); // ECHO: [13, 55, 144]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== if ===

The if element allows selection if the expression should be allocated and added to the result list or not. In the simplest case this allows filtering of an list.

; [ for (i = list) if (condition(i)) i ] : When the evaluation of the condition returns true, the expression i is added to the result list.

''Example''

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
list = [ for (a = [ 1 : 8 ]) if (a % 2 == 0) a ];
echo(list); // ECHO: [2, 4, 6, 8]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== let ===

The let element allows sequential assignment of variables inside an list comprehension definition.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
list = [ for (a = [ 1 : 4 ]) let (b = a*a, c = 2 * b) [ a, b, c ] ];
echo(list); // ECHO: [[1, 1, 2], [2, 4, 8], [3, 9, 18], [4, 16, 32]]
&lt;/source&gt;

== Nested loops ==

There are different ways to define nested loops. Defining multiple loop variables inside one for element and multiple for elements produce both flat result lists. To generate nested result lists an additional [ ] markup is required.

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// nested loop using multiple variables
flat_result1 = [ for (a = [ 0 : 2 ], b = [ 0 : 2 ]) a == b ? 1 : 0 ];
echo(flat_result1); // ECHO: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// nested loop using multiple for elements
flat_result2 = [ for (a = [ 0 : 2 ]) for (b = [0 : 2])  a == b ? 1 : 0 ];
echo(flat_result2); // ECHO: [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// nested loop to generate nested output list
nested_result = [ for (a = [ 0 : 2 ]) [ for (b = [ 0 : 2 ]) a == b ? 1 : 0 ] ];
echo(nested_result); // ECHO: [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0], [0, 0, 1]]
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;

== Advanced Examples ==

This chapter lists some advanced examples, useful idioms and use-cases for the list comprehension syntax.

=== Generate polygon points ===

[[File:OpenSCAD-ellipse.png|thumb|Result]]

; input : range to generate the angles
; output : points as input for polygon() module

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
// generate ellipse points
function x(a) = 20 * sin(a);
function y(a) = 30 * cos(a);
points = [ for (a = [0 : 5 : 359]) [ x(a), y(a) ] ];
polygon(points);
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br clear=&quot;all&quot;/&gt;

=== Flatten a nested list ===

; input : nested list
; output : list with the outer level nesting removed

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
function flatten(l) = [ for (a = l) for (b = a) b ] ;
nested_list = [ [ 1, 2, 3 ], [ 4, 5, 6 ] ];
echo(flatten(nested_list)); // ECHO: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Quicksort ===

; input : list of numbers
; output : sorted list of numbers

&lt;source lang=&quot;javascript&quot;&gt;
function quicksort(arr) = !(len(arr)&gt;0) ? [] : let(
    pivot   = arr[floor(len(arr)/2)],
    lesser  = [ for (y = arr) if (y  &lt; pivot) y ],
    equal   = [ for (y = arr) if (y == pivot) y ],
    greater = [ for (y = arr) if (y  &gt; pivot) y ]
) concat(
    quicksort(lesser), equal, quicksort(greater)
);

// use seed in rands() to get reproducable results
unsorted = [for (a = rands(0, 10, 6, 3)) ceil(a)];
echo(unsorted); // ECHO: [6, 1, 8, 9, 3, 2]
echo(quicksort(unsorted)); // ECHO: [1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 9]
&lt;/source&gt;

Production[edit]
Casting[edit]
Hirani cast Sushant Singh Rajput after Kai Po Che 's director Abhishek Kapoor showed him Rajput's rushes.[5][6] Aamir Khan, Ram Sethi, and Anushka Sharma were all confirmed to be performing in the film, with Khan stated to be portraying lead character of PK.[7][8]

Filming[edit]
The co-director Khan began looking for shooting locations in July 2012.[9] Second unit filming was set to begin in late 2012,[10] which was stalled after the rumoured departure of three department heads for the film and bad weather stalling initial shoots.[11][12] Hirani denied rumours that the film would be delayed, stating that principal filming had always been intended to begin in mid-January 2013 in Delhi and Rajasthan to &quot;capture the winter of Delhi&quot;.[13][14] Shooting officially began on 1 February 2013,[15] with the filming scheduled to occur over a 45-day period.[16] A 26-day schedule of shooting of PK started in Delhi from 27 September 2013.[17][18][19] When the shoot of the film was going on in Chandni Chowk area of Delhi, an FIR was lodged against makers of the film for allegedly hurting religious sentiments in October 2013. The objection was regarding a scene in the movie where a man dressed as the Hindu deity, Lord Shiva pulls the rickshaw with two burqa clad women as passengers.[20]

Release[edit]
PK is scheduled to release on 19 December 2014. PK Movie Second Motion Poster is launched on 20 August 2014[21]

==Containers in CS==
A ''''container'''' in the realm of {{wp|computer science}} (CS) is a {{wp|variable}} type which holds other values. The variable is a key referencing the data of the type within. A primitive type is an element of the language and is used to define more complex types. 

At the base level--where things are machine dependent: nibbles make up bytes, bytes make up short words, short words make up long words, and (sometimes both short and) long words can be doubled, quadrupled (x4), quintupled (x5) or bundled into larger blocks of bytes given interpretation at the machine code level by the program's conventions for assigning and defining types. 
&lt;br&gt;
The list above are all primitive types the hardware can manage, the interpretation and program handling of them as a language primitive type is the function of the compiler writers.
&lt;br&gt; 
Applications programs rely on those definitions for types such as characters (this text), integers (no fractions, please!), floating point values ({{wp|decimal}}s in {{wp|base 10}} represented in {{wp|base 2}} --{{wp|binary}} or {{wp|machine language|machine form}}). These Computer Languages must of necessity also have matching primitives, known as {{wp|pointers}} to describe the {{wp|memory address}} (or physical address) of any and all data elements of each of those primitives. If the element cannot be directly accessed in a {{wp|random access}} operation, it is not a discrete element which makes it part of a larger element--a  container which holds it's physical state.
&lt;br&gt; 
In {{wp|bitwise}} arithmetic, an integer will frequently be used with particular bits having an associated meaning. These are said to be flags, and together with a bit mask are often used as classifications (is part of this set, satisfies this condition, meets or doesn't meet this test) for determination of further processing. These are YES-NO or TRUE-FALSE evaluations, operations of {{wp|boolean logic}}.

When the data primitives need to be handled in bunches, a container type is used. 

* A string is a container containing characters that are not meant to be processed as numeric data, or simply text; though the legal representation of text depends on how the text is coded (unicode, ASCII, BOM, etc.).
* An array, an indexed randomly accessible group of values is another type of container. The ''array of a type'' (integer, strings, etc.) can hold elements of each matching primitive type. At the machine level, the beginning of the array is an '''address ('A')''', the value at that address is the ''first element'' which can hold a ''value of that type''. The next element is offset by the '''''length (L) of the type''''' of data in {{wp|byte}}s&amp;mdash;the lowest data form which can be individually addressed (indexed for random access)&amp;mdash; so the '''(''address of the first element'' + L)''' or '''(A + L)''' gives the address of the next element. This can be written with an index or cursor variable 'I' so that the Nth element, where I= (N-1) can be addressed by '''A&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = (A + L * I)''' often represented by '''V[i]''', where V is a variable name. The maximum number of elements in an array is thus N, since the V[0] must be a offset in address arithmetic of zero, and V[N] is an illegal index for it calculates an address in another place in memory not allocated to the array. '''V[N-1]''' is thus the last element of N declared memory addresses L bytes in length.
* A matrix

==Trainz containers==
# An {{TL|asset}} or {{TL|content}} is a file folder on the OS containing the self-definition files for itself, and which are then incorporated into the Trainz data base as managed by [[TR|L|TrainzUtil]] and [[TL|Content Manager]].
# All assets contain a header or self-definitions file Trainz calls [[TL|config.txt]], a resource organizing and parameters declaring text file without which the asset self-definition fails, or has {{TL|Fixing errors|Faults}} per the spin N3V twists the term to mean.
# A {{TG|C|.cdp file}} (or .cdp2, .cdpa variations) is another trains container, a portable compressed data collection we receive from other Trainzer, across Trainz versions by export and import, and the data form uploaded and downloaded from the {{TL|DLS}}.
# A Trainz '''container''' is an {{TG|E|enumerated}} (defined and constrained) data structure of a complex type, which may include tags, often dummy tags, and values or references ({{TL|KUIDS}}) as well as {{TR|C|sub-containers}}.
## They often contain variable length (to the {{TN|C|CC}}) array declarations (passenger attachment point {{TN|pass parameters}}) which are used to allocate actual memory and initialization values as modified by the accompanying defining tags in the same structure or by inheritance from the parent container.
## What containers are legal in a config, depends on the asset {{TL|KIND}} tag definition.
## '''Include files''' are a computer science class implemented in Trainz by {{TR|d|texture.txt file}}s and by '''reference''', meaning listing a KUID of a component {{TN|dependency}}. Texture.txt files in Trainz confusingly in the config.txt declarations MUST NOT have the extension {{TN|.|.txt}}, but end with {{TN|.|.texture}} extensions.
## In the Trainz hierarchy, {{TBS|KIND}}s are an upper level complex type with implicit nesting of the necessary tags.
### That is just about all kind definitions add some tags in the config not nested in the paired curly braces characteristic a general kind PLUS an element that is a container in appearance.
### These are '''''de facto sub-containers''' special to only that KIND'', whereas a Trainz container type is more general purpose, so declarable and used in more than one KIND requirement. In effect, the containers are really sub-containers of KIND which satisfy the broader needs of several to many asset self-definitions.
### The implicit nesting is controlled by declaration of the kind tag, so KIND tags not inside it's special sub-containers can be processed correctly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The ratings are the same as with the books, 4 below is the ones I regret wasting my time with. I hope never to go below 4 if I do I will probably quit in the middle an that is marked with a Q. The 5s are the ones I wished I had avoided but were not so bad and beyond 6 (reserved for pleasant commercial fluff in most part) are all the ones that I'm glad I've seen.

In the last two chapters, we have studied test function spaces and distributions. In this chapter we will demonstrate a method to obtain solutions to linear partial differential equations which uses test function spaces and distributions.

== Fundamental Solutions ==
In the last chapter, we had defined multiplication of a distribution with a smooth function and derivatives of distributions. Therefore, for a distribution &lt;math&gt;\mathcal T&lt;/math&gt;, we are able to calculate such expressions as
:&lt;math&gt;a \cdot \partial_\alpha \mathcal T&lt;/math&gt;
for a smooth function &lt;math&gt;a: \mathbb R^d \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; and a &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional multiindex &lt;math&gt;\alpha \in \mathbb N_0^d&lt;/math&gt;. We therefore observe that in a linear partial differential equation of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \Omega : \sum_{\alpha \in \mathbb N_0^d} a_\alpha(x) \partial_\alpha u(x) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
we could insert any distribution &lt;math&gt;\mathcal T&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; in the left hand side. However, equality would not hold in this case, because on the right hand side we have a function, but the left hand side would give us a distribution (as finite sums of distributions are distributions again due to theorem 4.?; remember that only finitely many &lt;math&gt;a_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; are allowed to be nonzero). If we however replace the right hand side by &lt;math&gt;\mathcal T_f&lt;/math&gt; (the regular distribution corresponding to &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;), then there might be distributions &lt;math&gt;\mathcal T&lt;/math&gt; which satisfy the equation. In this case, we speak of a ''distributional solution''. Let's summarise this definition in a box.

{{TextBox| M=0 | W=100% | BG=#FFFFFF |1='''Definition 5.?''':

Let &lt;math&gt;O \subseteq \mathbb R^d&lt;/math&gt; be open, let
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in O : \sum_{\alpha \in \mathbb N_0^d} a_\alpha(x) \partial_\alpha u(x) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
be a linear partial differential equation, and let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal T \in \mathcal D(O)^*&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal T&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''distributional solution''' to the above linear partial differential equation iff
:&lt;math&gt;\forall \varphi \in \mathcal D(O) : \sum_{\alpha \in \mathbb N_0^d} a_\alpha \partial_\alpha \mathcal T(\varphi) = \mathcal T_f (\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;}}

Now we will show how we can obtain distributional solutions to a partial differential equation. The method of choice will be to guess a so-called ''fundamental solution'' and then construct solutions with the help of that fundamental solution.

{{TextBox| M=0 | W=100% | BG=#FFFFFF |1='''Definition 5.?''':

Let &lt;math&gt;O \subseteq \mathbb R^d&lt;/math&gt; be open and let
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in O : \sum_{\alpha \in \mathbb N_0^d} a_\alpha(x) \partial_\alpha u(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
be a linear homogenous partial differential equation. If &lt;math&gt;F : O \to \mathcal D(O)^*&lt;/math&gt; has the two properties
#&lt;math&gt;\forall \varphi \in \mathcal D(O) : x \mapsto F(x)(\varphi) \text{ is continuous}&lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in O : F(x) \text{ is a solution to } \forall \varphi \in \mathcal D(O) : \sum_{\alpha \in \mathbb N_0^d} a_\alpha \partial_\alpha F(x)(\varphi) = \delta_x(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;
, we call &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; a '''fundamental solution'''.}}

Now why we defined this is: Once we have a fundamental solution for the homogenous equation (i. e. &lt;math&gt;f = 0&lt;/math&gt;), we can easily construct solutions to the inhomogenous problem. We shall now explain how this works.

{{TextBox| M=0 | W=100% | BG=#FFFFFF |1='''Lemma 5.?''':

Let &lt;math&gt;\{\mathcal T_\lambda : \lambda \in \mathcal I\} \subseteq \mathcal D(O)^*&lt;/math&gt; be a family of distributions, where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal I \subseteq \mathbb R^d&lt;/math&gt;. Let's further assume that for all &lt;math&gt;\varphi \in \mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;\lambda \mapsto T_\lambda(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on &lt;math&gt;\Lambda&lt;/math&gt; and bounded, and let &lt;math&gt;f \in L^1(\Lambda)&lt;/math&gt;. Then
:&lt;math&gt;T(\varphi) := \int_\Lambda f(\lambda) T_\lambda(\varphi) d \lambda&lt;/math&gt;
is a distribution.}}

''Proof'': Due to the truncation of &lt;math&gt;L^p&lt;/math&gt;-functions, we have that there are radii &lt;math&gt;R_i \in \R_+&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\Lambda \setminus B_{R_i}(0)} | f(\lambda) | d\lambda &lt; \frac{1}{2 i \|T_\lambda(\varphi)\|_\infty}&lt;/math&gt;
, where &lt;math&gt;\|T_\lambda(\varphi)\|_\infty&lt;/math&gt; is the supremum of the function &lt;math&gt;\lambda \mapsto T_\lambda(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;B_{R_i}(0)&lt;/math&gt; is a compact set, since it is bounded as well as closed. Therefore, we may divide &lt;math&gt;B_{R_i}(0)&lt;/math&gt; into finitely many (let's say &lt;math&gt;n_i&lt;/math&gt;) squares &lt;math&gt;d_{m_i}&lt;/math&gt; with diameter at most &lt;math&gt;\delta_i&lt;/math&gt;, such that
:&lt;math&gt;\forall \nu \in B_{R_i}(0) : \lambda \in B_{\delta_i} (\nu) \Rightarrow |T_\lambda(\varphi) - T_\nu(\varphi)| &lt; \frac{1}{2i \|f\|_{L^1}}&lt;/math&gt;
. This we may do because continuous functions are uniformly continuous on compact sets. At the border, we just round the squares so that they fit in with the sphere. Furthermore, we choose for each square a &lt;math&gt;\lambda_{m_i}&lt;/math&gt; inside this square.

We choose now
:&lt;math&gt;T_i(\varphi) := \sum_{m=0}^{n_i} \int_{d_{m_i}} f(\lambda) T_{\lambda_{m_i}}(\varphi) d \lambda&lt;/math&gt;
, which is a finite linear combination of distributions and therefore a distribution. Due to the normal triangle inequality for the absolute value, the triangle inequality for the Lebegue integral, our first calculation and the fundamental integral estimation, we obtain:
:&lt;math&gt;|T_i(\varphi) - T(\varphi)| &lt; \sum_{m=0}^{n_i} \int_{d_{m_i}} | f(\lambda) (T_{\lambda_{m_i}}(\varphi) - T_\lambda(\varphi))| d \lambda + \frac{\|T_\lambda(\varphi)\|_\infty}{2 i \|T_\lambda(\varphi)\|_\infty} \le \frac{1}{i}&lt;/math&gt;

This obviously goes to zero, and this lemma follows with Lemma 2.1.

Let's assume that in equation &lt;math&gt;(*)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is integrable. Let &lt;math&gt;K_{(\cdot)}&lt;/math&gt; be a fundamental solution for &lt;math&gt;(*)&lt;/math&gt; with respect to the locally convex normed function space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;\forall \phi \in \mathcal A&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;\xi \mapsto K_\xi(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; is bounded. Then we can know, that:
:&lt;math&gt;T(\varphi) = \int_{\R^d} f(\xi) K_\xi(\varphi) d\xi&lt;/math&gt;
is well-defined and solves &lt;math&gt;(*)&lt;/math&gt; in the sense of distributions.

''Proof'': Since by the definition of fundamental solutions, the function &lt;math&gt;\xi \mapsto K_\xi(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, we may apply lemma 2.2, which gives us that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is indeed well-defined.

To show that it really solves &lt;math&gt;(*)&lt;/math&gt; in the sense of distributions, we need the following calculation:
:&lt;math&gt;LT(\varphi) = T(L^*\varphi) = \int_{\R^d} f(\xi) K_\xi(L^* \varphi) d\xi = \int_{\R^d} f(\xi) LK_\xi(\varphi) d\xi&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; = \int_{\R^d} f(\xi) \delta_\xi(\varphi) d\xi = \int_{\R^d} f(\xi) \varphi(\xi) d\xi = T_f(\varphi)&lt;/math&gt;
, which is what we wanted to show.

== Green's functions ==
Assume that for each &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;, the fundamental solution &lt;math&gt;K_\xi&lt;/math&gt; is a regular distribution, i. e. for each &lt;math&gt;\xi \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, there is an integrable function &lt;math&gt;G( \cdot| \xi)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;K_\xi = T_{G(\cdot | \xi)}&lt;/math&gt;. Then we call this function &lt;math&gt;G: \R^d \times \Omega \to \R&lt;/math&gt; a ''Green's function'' for &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.


== Green's kernels ==
Let's assume that &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; has the Green's function &lt;math&gt;G(\cdot|\xi)&lt;/math&gt;. If there exists a function &lt;math&gt;\tilde G: \R^d \to \R&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;G(\cdot|\xi) = \tilde G(\cdot - \xi)&lt;/math&gt;
, then we call &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt; a ''Green's kernel'' for &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt; be a locally integrable function, and &lt;math&gt;\Omega \subseteq \R^d&lt;/math&gt; be a domain. Then the family of distributions &lt;math&gt;K_\xi := T_{\tilde G(\cdot - \xi)} \in \mathcal D'(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined and depends continuously on &lt;math&gt;\xi&lt;/math&gt;. Furthermore, for each &lt;math&gt;\phi \in \mathcal D(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, the function &lt;math&gt;\xi \mapsto K_\xi(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; is bounded.

''Proof'': Well-definedness follows from Lemma 1.3.

Let &lt;math&gt;\phi \in \mathcal D(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\xi_n \to \xi&lt;/math&gt;. Then we can calculate the following:
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\tilde G(\cdot - \xi_n)}(\phi) - T_{\tilde G(\cdot - \xi)}(\phi) = \int_{\R^d} \tilde G(x - \xi_n) \phi(x) dx - \int_{\R^d} \tilde G(x - \xi) \phi(x) dx = \int_{\R^d} \tilde  G(x) (\phi(x + \xi_n) - \phi(x + \xi)) dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\le \max_{x \in \R^d} |\phi(x + \xi_n) - \phi(x + \xi)| \underbrace{\int_{\text{supp } \phi + B_{2\xi}(0)} \tilde  G(x) dx}_\text{constant}&lt;/math&gt;
for sufficiently large &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, where the last expression goes to &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n \to \infty&lt;/math&gt;, since the support of &lt;math&gt;\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt; is compact and therefore the function is (even uniformly) continuous.

Furthermore, we have
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\tilde G(\cdot - \xi)}(\phi) = \int_{\R^d} \tilde G(x - \xi) \phi(x) dx = \int_{\text{supp } \phi} \tilde G(x) \phi(x + \xi) dx&lt;/math&gt;

, which is zero for &lt;math&gt;\|\xi\|&lt;/math&gt; sufficiently large, which is why the function &lt;math&gt;\xi \mapsto K_\xi(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; has compact support. But since the function is also continuous, we know that it obtains a maximum and a minimum and is therefore bounded.

This lemma shows that if we have found a locally integrable function &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;LT_{\tilde G(\cdot - \xi)} = \delta_\xi&lt;/math&gt;, we already know that it is a Green's kernel, and don't need to check the continuity property.

{{TextBox| M=0 | W=100% | BG=#FFFFFF |1='''Theorem 5.?''': (Fubini's theorem)

Let &lt;math&gt;A \subseteq \mathbb R^i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq \mathbb R^j&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;i, j&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary natural numbers, and let &lt;math&gt;f: A \times B \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; be a function. Then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_A \int_B f(x, y) dy dx = \int_{A \times B} f(x, y) d(x, y) = \int_B \int_A f(x, y) dx dy&lt;/math&gt;}}

Now this theorem finally shows us why distributions are useful:

Let &lt;math&gt;\tilde G&lt;/math&gt; be a Green's kernel for &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;f \in L^\infty(\R^d)&lt;/math&gt;. If
:&lt;math&gt;u(x) = (f * \tilde G)(x)&lt;/math&gt;
is sufficiently often differentiable such that &lt;math&gt;L u&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, then it is a solution for &lt;math&gt;(*)&lt;/math&gt; in the classical sense.

''Proof'': From a case of [[w:Hölder's_inequality|Hölder's inequality]] (namely &lt;math&gt;p = 1, q = \infty&lt;/math&gt;, i. e. &lt;math&gt;\|f \cdot \tilde G\|_{L^1} \le \|\tilde G\|_{L^1} \cdot \|f\|_{L^\infty}&lt;/math&gt;), we obtain that &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; is locally integrable, which is why &lt;math&gt;T_u&lt;/math&gt; is a distribution in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal D'(\R^d)&lt;/math&gt;.

Furthermore, due to the [[w:Fubini's_theorem#Theorem_statement|theorem of Fubini]], we have for &lt;math&gt;\varphi \in \mathcal D(\R^d)&lt;/math&gt;, that
:&lt;math&gt;T_u(\varphi) = \int_{\R^d} (f * \tilde G)(x) \varphi(x) dx = \int_{\R^d} \int_{\R^d} f(y) \tilde G(x - y) \varphi(x) dy dx&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; = \int_{\R^d} \int_{\R^d} \tilde G(x - y) \varphi(x) dx ~ f(y) dy = \int_{\R^d} T_{\tilde G(\cdot - \xi)}(\varphi) f(y) dy&lt;/math&gt;
, which is why &lt;math&gt;T_u&lt;/math&gt; solves &lt;math&gt;(*)&lt;/math&gt; in the sense of distributions (this is due to theorem 2.3).

Thus, for all &lt;math&gt;\varphi \in \mathcal D(\R^d)&lt;/math&gt;, we can calculate the following:
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\R^d} (Lu)(x) \varphi(x) dx = T_{Lu} (\varphi) = LT_u(\varphi) = T_f(\varphi) = \int_{\R^d} f(x) \varphi(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;
and therefore
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\R^d} ((Lu)(x) - f(x)) \varphi(x) dx = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
From this follows that &lt;math&gt;Lu = f&lt;/math&gt; almost everywhere. But since &lt;math&gt;Lu&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; are both continuous, they must be equal everywhere. This is what we wanted to prove.

==Dependent relationships==
{{TRS-byline|Fabartus}}
Trainz dependencies are not like my sons living at little cost whilst mom and I pay for most everything, but describe a relationship of assets to parts of an asset. In the acquisition of content you will likely all too quickly come face to face with a route or session asset where a part called for in the {{TBS|kuid-table}} is no where to be found. This is in part because various people have taken up the hobby, and not all of them are inclined to donate their creations made possible only through a long process of sometimes hard research and painstaking effort...

      <text xml:space="preserve">BAL/BALR is a Branch and Link Instruction. It is used to store the address of next sequential instruction and jump at the specified address in Oprand 2.

Example

'''&lt;u&gt;BALR R5,R3&lt;/u&gt;'''

It will store NSI(Next Sequential Address) in R5 and Jump to the address stored in R3.

'''&lt;u&gt;BALR R14,0&lt;/u&gt;'''   &lt;---Special Use

It will just store NSI in R14 and don not jump to any where because Oprand 2 is R0

'''KIND Engine''' assets are classified as rolling stock which contain diesel or electric loco engine performance characteristics. The related sister-KIND or class asset is TR|K|KIND Steam-engine}} which uses many if not all of the same (sub-)containers or Child classes listed below, but has a different pallet of base data which needs be modeled and defined in the parent class (i.e. the container ''''KIND Engine''''&amp;mdash;those tags and special KIND containers discussed here below). This modular breakout should make working with {{TA|config}}s easier for the new and old Trainzers to get a handle on.
&amp;nbsp;

==Historical engine-specs==
Formats of engine specifications evolved from the earliest Trainz versions, perhaps more than any other digital modeling group of assets, which is readily understandable given the dependency of a locomotive's driving behavior (the physical reality modeled and simulated in a digital virtual world) depend more than any other class of object on tight interaction between scripting, animation elements, and the physics model within Trainz. Unfortunately, the older Content Creator's Guides (early era, HTML pages and files, after UTC as *.pdf files) were also generally kept online for ease of updating, and cannot now*&lt;ref
 group=&quot;notes&quot; name=&quot;*1&quot;&gt; unless N3V relents, and restores the url links&amp;mdash;a Ticket was put in about this in mid-August 2014&lt;/ref&gt; be readily accessed  by new comers or others interested in comparing different digital models.{{TrainzTip|1=If these are of interest&amp;mdash;especially if you have ambitions to become a Loco CC maker and want to study the old vs. the new, make pals with someone who has the older versions downloaded and will share. Better yet, lurk on {{wp|eBay}} and such other consumer to consumer retail sites and acquire the older Trainz versions.}}

The containers and gross changes in engine-specs may be compared to the current grouping of tags and containers by seeing the CCGTC Online page: {{MainCCG|CCG/Kind:_Engine|Kind: Engine}}.

====autopilot-stop-distance====
:Type: float
:Desc: How far (in meters) in front of a typical obstruction (red light, etc.) the AI will attempt to stop the train. Changing this value can help fine-tune the accuracy of the AI's movement, however attempting to make the train stop too close to a target may result in overruns in some cases. This tag is intended for special-case usage only.

====autopilot-crawl-distance====
:Type: float
:Desc: Once this distance (in meters) from the intended stopping position has been reached, the AI will 'crawl' rather than attempt to speed up to reach its destination. Changing this value can help fine-tune the accuracy of the AI's movement, however attempting to make the train stop too close to a target may result in overruns in some cases. This tag is intended for special-case usage only.

====autopilot-caution-speed-multiplier====
:Type: float
:Desc: The AI will slow to this multiple of the speed limit when operating under caution conditions. This can be set to 1.0 in order to effectively remove caution-speed driving, however this can increase the risk of overruns in some cases

====throttle-adjustment-rate====
:Type: float
:Desc: Defines the adjustment rate at which the engine's throttle will adjust to match the train's throttle. Increasing this rate will make the engine more responsive at the possible cost of audio or driving realism. In DCC mode, a minimum value of 0.1 is used.

;Purpose
This template is used inside a category declaration to convert a TrainzOnline category declaration to a Wikibook equivalent&amp;mdash;which is to say prefixing the title&amp;mdash;and if a page is ported to the TrainzOnline wiki, the analogous template there does not perform the operation, maintaining the status quo ante.
* This operation is prefixing'' 'Trainz+space' ''to the N3V wiki category name.

example:
To convert &lt;code&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Asset Kind]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to a Wikibook NAMCON category, use: &lt;code&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:{{TCATconv}}Asset Kind]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which will build &lt;code&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Trainz Asset Kind]],&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/code&gt; AND if ported back to the TrainzOnline Wiki the complementary template will insert a null code, so act like it never occurred inline.  

The code action: &lt;tt&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;Trainz &lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; (note the trailing space&amp;mdash;the displayed portion highlighted is the actual code action of the template.)
{{selfTdoc}}{{TypeTaid}}
* The implementation of the corresponding TrainzOnline version corresponds to the action of the {{Tl|void}} template, just making the template so much vaporware.
&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Navigation|previous=The Malgrange-Ehrenpreis theorem}}

== Chapter 1 ==

=== Exercise 1 ===
The general ordinary differential equation is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in B : F(x, u(x), \overbrace{u'(x), u''(x), \ldots}^\text{arbitrarily but finitely high derivatives}) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
for a set &lt;math&gt;B \subseteq \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;. Noticing that
:&lt;math&gt;u'(x) = \partial_x u(x), u''(x) = \partial_x^2 u(x), \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
, we observe that the general ordinary differential equation is just the general ''one-dimensional'' partial differential equation.

=== Exercise 2 ===
Using the one-dimensional chain rule, we directly calculate
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t u(t, x) = \partial_t g(x + ct) = c g'(x + ct)&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_x u(t, x) = \partial_x g(x + ct) = g'(x + ct)&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_t u(t, x) - c \partial_x u(t, x) = c g'(x + ct) - c g'(x +ct) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

=== Exercise 3 ===
By choosing
:&lt;math&gt;h(t, x, z, p, q) = p - cq&lt;/math&gt;
, we see that in our function &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; first order derivatives suffice to depict the partial differential equation. On the other hand, if &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; needs no derivatives as arguments, we have due to theorem 1.4 (which you may have just proven in exercise 2) that for all continuously differentiable functions &lt;math&gt;g : \mathbb R \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall (t, x) \in \mathbb R^2 : h(t, x, g(x + ct)) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Since we can choose &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; as a constant function with an arbitrary real value, &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; does not depend on &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, since otherwise it would be nonzero somewhere for some constant function &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, as dependence on &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; means that a different &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; changes the value at least in one point. Therefore, the one-dimensional homogenous transport equation would be given by
:&lt;math&gt;h(x, t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
and there would be many more solutions to the initial value problem of the homogenous one-dimensional transport equation than those given by theorem and definition 1.5.

== Chapter 2 ==

=== Exercise 1 ===
Let &lt;math&gt;n \in \{1, \ldots, d\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(t, x) \in \mathbb R \times \mathbb R^d&lt;/math&gt; be arbitrary. We choose &lt;math&gt;B = [0, t]&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O = (-R, R)&lt;/math&gt; for an arbitrary &lt;math&gt;R &gt; |x_n|&lt;/math&gt; and apply Leibniz' integral rule. We first check that all the three conditions for Leibniz' integral rule are satisfied.

1.

Since &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal C^1(\mathbb R \times \mathbb R^d)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is continuous in all variables (so therefore in particular in the first), and the same is true for the composition of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; with any continuous function. Thus, as all continuous functions of one variable are integrable on an interval,
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^t f(s, y + \mathbf v (t - s)) ds&lt;/math&gt;
exists for all &lt;math&gt;y = (y_1, \ldots, y_n, \ldots, y_d)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;y_n \in O&lt;/math&gt; (in fact, it exists everywhere, but this is the requirement of Leibniz' rule in our situation).

2.

&lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; was supposed to be in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C^1(\mathbb R^2)&lt;/math&gt;, which is why
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dy_n} f(s, y + \mathbf v (t - s)) \overset{\text{chain rule}}{=} \partial_{x_n} f(s, y + \mathbf v (t - s))&lt;/math&gt;
exists for all &lt;math&gt;s \in B&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;y = (y_1, \ldots, y_n, \ldots, y_d)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;y_n \in O&lt;/math&gt; (in fact, it exists everywhere, but this is the requirement of Leibniz' rule in our situation).

3.

We note that &lt;math&gt;O = (-R, R) \subset [-R, R]&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, also &lt;math&gt;O \times B \subset [-R, R] \times B =: K&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is compact. Furthermore, as &lt;math&gt;\partial_{x_n} f&lt;/math&gt; was supposed to be continuous (by definition of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C^1(\mathbb R \times \mathbb R^d)&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dy_n} f(s, y + \mathbf v (t - s)) \overset{\text{chain rule}}{=} \partial_{x_n} f(s, y + \mathbf v (t - s))&lt;/math&gt;
is continuous as well as composition of continuous functions, also the function &lt;math&gt;\partial_{x_n} f(s, y + \mathbf v (t - s))&lt;/math&gt; is continuous in &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y_n&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, due to the extreme value theorem, it is bounded for &lt;math&gt;(s, y_n) \in K&lt;/math&gt;, i. e. there is a &lt;math&gt;b \in \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; such that for all
:&lt;math&gt;\left| \partial_{x_n} f(s, y + \mathbf v (t - s)) \right| &lt; b&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;y = (y_1, \ldots, y_n, \ldots, y_d)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;y_n \in O&lt;/math&gt;, provided that &lt;math&gt;y_1, \ldots, y_{n-1}, y_{n+1}, \ldots, y_d&lt;/math&gt; are fixed. Therefore, we might choose &lt;math&gt;g(s) = b&lt;/math&gt; and obtain that
:&lt;math&gt;\forall \left| \partial_{x_n} f(s, y + \mathbf v (t - s)) \right| &lt; |g(s)| \text{ and } \int_B |g(s)| ds = tb &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt;

Now we have checked all three ingredients for Leibniz' integral rule and thus obtain by it:
:&lt;math&gt;\partial_{x_n} \int_0^t f(s, y + \mathbf v(t - s)) ds = \int_0^t \partial_{x_n} f(s, y + \mathbf v(t - s)) ds&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;y = (y_1, \ldots, y_n, \ldots, y_d)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;y_n \in O&lt;/math&gt;. Setting &lt;math&gt;y = x&lt;/math&gt; gives the result for &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;n \in \{1, \ldots, d\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(t, x) \in \mathbb R \times \mathbb R^d&lt;/math&gt; were arbitrary, this completes the exercise.

=== Exercise 2 ===
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\partial_t g(x + t \mathbf v) &amp;= \begin{pmatrix}\partial_{x_1} g (x + t \mathbf v) &amp; \cdots &amp; \partial_{x_d} g (x + t \mathbf v) \end{pmatrix} \mathbf v &amp; \text{by the chain rule} \\
&amp;= \mathbf v \cdot \nabla_x g (x + t \mathbf v) &amp;
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Organization-based self-esteem (0.86 &lt;= alpha &lt;= 0.96) ==
=== Description ===

The authors introduced the organization-based self-esteem construct and its measurement. They conducted several field studies to inspect different types of reliability and validity.

=== Definition ===

The authors define organization-based self-esteem as &quot;the degree to which organizational members believe that they can satisfy their needs by participating in roles within the context of an organization&quot;.

=== Items ===

*I count around here.
*I am taken seriously (around here).
*I am important (around here).
*I am trusted (around here).
*There is faith in me (around here).
*I can make a difference (around here).
*I am valuable (around here).
*I am helpful (around here).
*I am efficient (around here).
*I am cooperative (around here).

The wording &quot;around here&quot; was later appended to all items to increase adjusted item-total correlations. 5-point Likert scales were employed, except for one of the seven studies where a 7-point scale was used.

=== Source ===

*[http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/256437 Pierce et al. (1989): Organization-Based Self-Esteem: Construct Definition, Measurement, And Validation. Academy of Management Journal, Vol. 32, No. 3, pp. 622-648.]

=== Comments ===

In all studies, the means turned out to be above the center. Given that a 5-point scale was employed, future researchers might use words like &quot;always&quot; to shift the means to the center, i.e., towards 3.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CHAPTER 2 - OMS SYMPTOMS'''

==Description==
This chapter is intended to provide details on symptoms that OMS patients may experience at onset as well as when relapses are occurring.

Opsoclonus Myoclonus Syndrome has some very distinct symptoms that can help in prompt diagnosis.  Despite this, OMS is often misdiagnosed; most commonly as acute cerebellar ataxia which is a viral infection that just needs time to take care of itself.  So, it is not uncommon for doctors to label it as acute cerebellar ataxia even though opsoclonus may be present, and send the toddler home.

==Symptoms==
But OMS’s symptoms show that without treatment, the toddler will continue to degrade.   Symptoms of OMS commonly include many of the following:

'''CHAPTER 3 - ONSET OF OMS'''


==Description==




This is generally the order in which the most prevalent symptoms of OMS can occur at the onset of the disease. As with many aspects of OMS, there are no steadfast rules or absolute consistencies. Some children will experience all of these symptoms in the order described below, some will experience only some of the symptoms, and in some, the order of appearance of symptoms will differ. The time frame in which the symptoms appear can also vary. In some, progression of disease in it’s acute phase can occur over a few days, in others it may be weeks or months. For a diagnosis of OMS to be made, technically only opsoclonus and myoclonus need to be present and all other more common causes of the two symptoms ruled out.

==First Symptoms==


Many parents of children who have been diagnosed with OMS, report that in the six to four weeks prior to any visable physical symptoms of disease, there are notable changes in the behavior of the child. A child who was once easy going and happy, will suddenly become oppositional or begin having exaggerated temper tantrums. Parents often think these behavioral changes are part of a developmental phase. The child may also wake more during the night during this time. There may also be some instances of problems with gross motor skills, tripping or falling more than usual, but nothing that would necessarily cause any concern, and would generally go unnoticed.


==Next Symptoms==



The child will suddenly be unable to walk properly or at all. If the child is still walking, he or she may appear to be walking like a drunkard. The child may complain of dizziness and refuse or not be able to stand unassisted. He or she may refuse to go down flights of stairs.  A child that was once independent will become incredibly clingy.   At this time, the child may also begin to struggle with fine motor skills especially with feeding. Behavior problems, separation anxiety, crying, and rage attacks may become more prevalent.

==Further Progression of Symptoms==


The child will lose the ability to sit unassisted (without support). They may not be able to hold their head up. The body will appear to be limp and floppy. Rage attacks persist along with sleep disturbance, and these states may be interrupted by periods of extreme lethargy and malaise. Myoclonus (full-body tremor or gross jerking) may begin, and may occur most when movement is attempted, be worse if the child is agitated or stimulated, but can also be present when the child is in a resting state.

==Loss of all Function==


Speech will become slurred or sound jerky, and eventually will be lost all together. Opsoclonus will begin, and may be nearly constant.  The child may lose the ability to eat due to issues with swallowing or vomiting and may need to be fed temporarily with a g tube. The child may be in a constant state of distress; screaming, biting, back-arching, flailing. He or she may only be able to sleep for minutes at a time. Attempts to sedate or calm with drugs commonly used for sedation or seizures will most likely not work or potentially make the state of distress even worse.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CHAPTER 4 - DIAGNOSIS AND HOSPITALIZATION'''


==Description==



Proper diagnosis of OMS can be a tremendous ordeal of dealing with first responders who have never observed the disease and quickly discount it as a minor issue.  In a 2014 survey of OMS caregivers, 59% of respondents indicated it took between two weeks and three months for accurate diagnosis.  So, it is not surprising that in some cases, parents have actually researched symptoms and self diagnosed the disease.   


Once diagnosed, it is very important to get care at a facility that has handled previous cases of OMS.   These hospitals are typically going to be found in the children's hospitals in major metroplexes.   Leading cities that have staff and facilities renowned for treating OMS include Los Angeles, Boston, Houston, Seattle, Chicago, Cincinnati, and Philadelphia.

==Diagnosis of OMS==

The time to diagnose OMS can vary greatly depending on the hospital and the specific first responders that are addressing the needs of the OMS warrior.   In some cases, diagnosis is very prompt while in other cases, the caregiver has needed to go from facility to facility in search of a proper diagnosis.  In many cases, the OMS warrior will ultimately get diagnosed by the pediatric neurologist or an oncologist.


Regardless of the length of time to find the diagnosis, the medical staff will likely run a series of tests and procedures to validate the diagnosis and to search for a neuroblastoma (cancer) in the OMS warrior.   It is very common to have multiple blood tests as well as a variety of scans including CT, MRI, and MIBG.   All are in search of the neuroblastoma.   Roughly 60%-70% of OMS warriors will have a Neuroblastoma discovered in the first few years of onset.

==Initial Hospitalization==


The initial hospital stay will typically last a few days up to two weeks as doctors begin treatment and stabilization of the OMS warrior.   Initial treatment protocols will likely include IVIG and a steroid.   While tests are run, you can expect a lot of activity as residents visit the patient in the hopes of understanding OMS and how to care for OMS warriors in the future.  


At this point of initial hospitalization, expect that the OMS warrior may be in a lot of pain and very scared as IVs are in the arm and multiple scans and tests are performed.   While there isn't much you can do to address that issue, be mindful that inexperienced caregivers and/or hospitals may make the experience more difficult than necessary.   One of the common complaints is staff that try to infuse IVIG a too high of a rate.   This has potential to provide great pain and anxiety to the OMS warrior.   Refer to Chapter 7 on medical treatments for more information.

==Preparing for a Hospital Visit==


Adapted and modified by Kaeli Sutton from a patient handout by Hasbro Children’s Hospital in Providence, RI.


The hospital can be a stressful environment for children-- they meet a lot of new people, encounter equipment and activity that is unfamiliar, and, most importantly, find their bodies subjected to ongoing medical procedures and testing. We understand that the family plays a critical role in a child’s understanding of his/her healthcare experience.  Below is information on helping your child successfully prepare for the hospital visit. 


'''* EXPLAIN''' what will happen to your child in terms they can understand. Reinforce positive vocabulary to alleviate their fears.  Use words that describe what they will hear, smell, feel, taste.  For example, you might find that describing what they might feel as they go under and come out of anesthesia is important, as well as what the staff/surgeons might look like (masks, hats, gloves) etc., to support decreasing frightening experiences. Imagine yourself in the situation, especially being acted upon by a lot of “large” people while you are lying down. Describe it to your child in the most direct and least frightening way. Remind them that you will be just outside (or with them) the whole time. Remind them that the doctors and nurses are there to help them heal and feel better. Toddlers and preschoolers cope best when they are told about the hospital stay 1-3 days before admission. They may not remember information given to them too far ahead of the event. Children of this age worry about being along, not coming home again, and that they are being punished; “I did something bad, and that’s why I am in the hospital.” Reassure them that they are not being punished. School-age children need to know at least a week in advance. This gives them ample time to think about the information and ask questions. School –age children often fear having anesthesia and need reassurance that they will not wake up or feel pain during the surgery. it is also important to clearly describe what will happen after they wake up and when you will be with them again. Many OMS warriors experience their most traumatic experiences POST procedure, when they wake up confused and they haven’t seen the parents yet. Adolescents should be informed as soon as possible. This age group copes best when given the opportunity to plan for and make decisions about the hospital stay. They also need reassurance that they will have as much privacy as possible, such as having curtains pulled around their bed and that they will be a part of decision making. 


'''* REMIND''' your child that they will be meeting many new people during their visit to the hospital. Explain that everyone they meet is there to help them feel better, and if your child is in pain, he/she should let someone know.  

 
'''* ENCOURAGE''' your child to ask questions of you and the healthcare team. If your child is having difficulty expressing feelings, ask questions like, “What kinds of things are you wondering about when we go to the hospital?” If you sense that your child is anxious about going to the hospital, you may want to begin the discussion with, “What do you think the hospital will be like? Young children often express their feelings through play. If you have a play medical kit at home, encourage your child to use it. You can participate by being the patient and your child being the doctor or nurse. Ask questions like, “What is this used for?” If your child displays a misunderstanding, help make your child aware of what will actually happen. Also, often, just observing the themes in a young child’s play will show you some of what they’re dealing with/exploring, and you can speak to that. Sometimes it’s best to speak to it directly, but other times you can just join in the creative play as another character/voice and communicate that way. Little ones often are overwhelmed by too much “you” focus, and do better with it being a story about someone/something else.  For example, you could play a game with them in which they were the doctor taking care of one of their stuffed animals.  Through the course of the play, the parent could be a nurse, and gently support the “doctor” in creating a scene similar to that the child will actually encounter.  In this play, you are helping the child know what to expect, while not focusing to directly on them.  You are also giving them a chance, through play, to give clues around what they might be worried about or wondering about.


'''* ENCOURAGE''' your child to express what they are feeling and reassure them that all feelings they have are okay. It is important
to listen and empathize with your child. 


'''* BE HONEST'''.  Many families try to protect their children and give them information that isn’t necessarily correct. This can be confusing to a child and may cause them to mistrust hospital staff. Not knowing what is going to happen can be more frightening for a child. For example, preoperative blood tests hurt, so don’t tell a child that the needle is painless or feels like a tiny mosquito bit. We have found that kids who know what to expect are less fearful and have a far better experience than children who are not prepared.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CHAPTER 5 - QUESTIONS FOR YOUR DOCTOR'''


==Description==


Having a family mamber who is battling OMS does not mean that there are no answers.  It is imperative that the doctors provide answers to your questions.   This chapter will outline some important questions that should be asked and that you should expect answers from your medical provider.

==Questions During Onset, Initial Diagnosis and Hospitalization==


Some questions that you should ask your specialist treating you or your child during onset, diagnosis, and initial treatment and hospitalization include:


''' Diagnosis''':

* How many OMS patients have you diagnosed and treated previously?
* How many OMS patients has your hospital diagnosed and treated in the past 5 years?
* What definitive tests have you performed to conclude that my child has OMS?

* Does my child have a neuroblastoma?
* What additional scans will be completed to verify if a neuroblastoma exists?
* What is the severity level of the OMS?


''' Treatment''':

* How long will the patient be hospitalized?
* Describe the initial treatment protocol we will begin.
* Do you consult with an OMS specialist or researcher on the latest treatment protocol?
* What treatment options are available?
* What is the timeline that I can expect to see improvement in the OMS symptoms?



''' Scans and Tests''':

* What scan(s) will be performed?  CT, MIBG, MRI?  What are you looking for and what is the difference in them?
* If no neuroblastoma is found, will we need to scan again at some point in time?
* What are the risks of exposing all of this radiation to my child versus the ongoing OMS symptoms?
* When you perform a lumbar puncture, what would indicate OMS?
* Please explain the tests for B cells and T cells.


==Questions to ask throughout the first 3 years of treatments==


''' Short and Long Term Effects of the Treatment Protocol''':

* What are the effects of the steroids my child is taking?
* What are the effects of the IViG?
* Why does my child get certain symptoms after IViG; flu like symptoms, headaches, etc...
* Is there a difference in IViG brands?   What is best for my child?
* Why would a chemotherapy treatment be part of the treatment protocol?
* What are the side effects of trazodone?
* Is my child more susceptible to illness when other people are sick?
* Should we consider getting a port for my child?   What are the pros and cons?
* Can IViG be administered from home?   What are the pros and cons?




''' Tapering off of the Drugs''':

* What is the difference between the steroids ACTH, Dexamethasone, and Prednisolone?  What are the pros and cons of one versus the others?
* What is the schedule for tapering my child off of the steroids?
* How long is a child typically using steroids?
* When do we begin tapering the IViG?
* Every time we get to a certain dose in the tapering process, symptoms appear.  What do we do to avoid these relapses?

* What happens if the tapering is not working?

==Questions to ask in the event of a relapse==


* Are relapses typical for OMS kids?
* How long do relapses last?
* What steps should I take to prevent relapses?
* I have other children at home.  How can I keep the OMS child from getting sick?


==Questions to ask the Therapists==



'''''Initial Visit''''':

'''CHAPTER 7 - MEDICAL TREATMENTS USED BY OMS PATIENTS'''


==Description==

Medical treatment for OMS can vary from child to child, generally a combination of several agents are used to reach remission or maintenance. Steroids, ivig, chemotherapy, and anti-rejection drugs are among the drugs regularly prescribed to treat OMS. Treatments all work in different ways to suppress the immune system and decrease inflammation to reduce the attack on the brain. Initially an aggressive approach using multiple agents has shown to yield better outcomes.  Since OMS is a complicated and relatively unknown disease even in medical circles, it is a generally agreed upon practice in the OMS community for the patient to utilize the OMS specialist to set the treatment protocol while the local pediatrician, oncologist, neurologist, or other local practitioner implements the treatment protocol.


For information regarding denial of treatment by insurance companies, please refer to chapter 14.

==Treatments==

During the acute phase of the illness, higher doses and multiple agents are often used to hopefully halt disease activity. As the child recovers from onset, doses and the number of drugs used will decrease. If relapse occurs, doses may be increased and agents may be added until disease activity is again slowed or stopped. The course and duration of treatment is determined by severity of symptoms and expansion of b and/or t cells in the spinal fluid. It is reasonable to expect your child to be on some combination of treatment for at least one year, though it is not uncommon for treatment to last several years. There is some controversy about right and wrong ways to treat. It is critical that you have an open dialog with your prescribing physician so you can discuss your questions and concerns or a new plan of attack if you don’t feel current treatment is effective. Most important, do what works for your child.

Intense treatment is exhausting and can be traumatic for a young child. Remember that treatment may continue for several years, every attempt should be made to lessen the anxiety experienced by the child at each hospital visit or treatment so that he/she will be able to endure. Work with your treating physician to create a plan to make hospital visits and treatment more fun. Many children’s hospitals have staff whose sole job is to entertain patients and make their experiences less stressful.
Many parents find it to be less traumatic and easier to have a port-a-cath placed in the child’s upper chest for infusions. A port allows for easy access to the blood stream for infusions. Instead of searching for veins and starting an IV, all the nurse has to do is basically “plug in” by using a special needle that pokes directly through the skin into the port. The skin over the port can be numbed using EMLA (lidocaine) cream, so that the child feels little pain when being accessed. Another benefit of a port is that it is out of the way and won’t be accidently bumped or easily pulled out as can happen if the child is upset and an IV is placed in the hand or arm.

==Steroids (Cortisone):== 

Steroids are usually the first type of treatment used to treat OMS. Commonly used to treat autoimmune disease, steroids suppress the immune system and are also some of the most powerful anti-inflammatory drugs.  Generally dosing begins high and slowly tapers down as the child recovers.  If the child suffers a relapse of symptoms due to illness (cold, flu, infection) or tapering too quickly, it is often necessary to increase the dose, and hold until the symptoms subside before continuing the taper. Steroids can be given in a daily dose or a pulse dose. Pulse dosing consists of steroids being given once a week or once a month. Some parents report less severe side effects with pulse dosing as opposed to a more consistent dosing schedule. Depending on the drug, steroids can be administered in pill or liquid form by mouth, injected intramuscularly, or given intravenously. 

Steroids can cause irritability, elevated blood pressure, water retention, increased hunger, increased stomach acid production, susceptibility to infection, insomnia, nausea, dizziness, stunted growth, and frequent urination. Rare side effects include; cataracts, diabetes, bone weakness, bone death, and psychosis. At the beginning of treatment, you should expect weekly visits to the doctor to check blood pressure, glucose levels in the urine, and weight. A low sodium diet is highly recommended to reduce swelling due to fluid retention (Cushing’s syndrome). It is often recommended to give ranitidine (Zantac) along with steroids to prevent stomach discomfort and excess stomach acid production. Because steroids reduce calcium absorption, a calcium supplement is recommended.  Never suddenly discontinue steroids, always follow a doctor’s recommendation for a tapering schedule. Sudden discontinuation of steroids will likely cause relapse and result in symptoms of steroid withdrawal.

•	ACTH:  Acthar Gel is the brand name of the pharmaceutical preparation of ACTH. ACTH comes in a small vial which when refrigerated for storage is a gel, but when warmed to room temperature for administering, turns into a thick liquid. ACTH must be injected intramuscularly, usually in the upper thigh. It is recommended to alternate thighs and injection spots when giving a dose. Your hospital or home nurse should teach you how to inject ACTH. Some parents find it helpful to practice injecting with an empty syringe and an orange. The ACTH dosing schedule starts at a high dose twice a day, drops to a daily dose, then drops to a dose every other day. Once the every other day schedule begins, the amount of ACTH in the dose will begin to decrease.   Acthar Gel is extremely expensive. Contact the National Organization of Rare Diseases (NORD) for assistance with paying for Acthar Gel if the child in uninsured or underinsured.

•	Prednisolone: Prednisolone is taken orally in pill form. In the acute phase of OMS, it will be prescribed in a daily high dose. In the event of a flare or relapse later, it may be prescribed in a pulse dose, likely given on the weekend.

•	Dexamethasone (Decadron): “Dex” is given in pill form or intravenously. It can be prescribed daily or in pulse doses consisting of 2-3 days a month in very high doses.

•	Methylprednisolone: Given intravenously in pulse doses.

==Chemotherapy: ==

Chemotherapy drugs are used for their ability to temporarily eliminate either b or t cells.  OMS patients don’t experience many of the risks of infection that cancer patients experience because one chemotherapy drug is used at a time eliminating only some of the overall lymphocytes. OMS patients also experience less severe side effects from chemo drugs partly because of the nature of the specific agents used and also because the doses used are smaller. As with all forms of immunosuppression, chemotherapy does increase the risk of infection and infection can potentially cause relapse.

•	Rituximab (Rituxan): Rituxan works by depleting b cells. It is given in four doses of  375mg/m2, one week apart. It can also be given in two double doses given two weeks apart. The effects of Rituxan on the B cell population last for about 6-8 months. After this time, the B cell population regenerates and in some children remission is achieved, in others repeat doses or a different agent is needed. 
Rituxan has a black box warning. Instances of death upon infusion due to severe allergic reaction have occurred. Rituxan has also been linked with cases of Progressive Multifocal Luekoencephalopathy  (PML).   PML is caused by activation of the JC virus. 90% of the population has dormant JC virus. Both death upon infusion and due to PML are extremely rare, but parents should be aware and informed. No cases of death from anaphylaxis during infusion or PML due to Rituxan have been reported in children with OMS.  Rituxan can also activate dormant hepatitis B, testing for hepatitis B should be done before treatment with Rituxan. Less serious side effects of Rituxan include; nausea, headaches, fever, and chills. Many children with OMS treated with Rituxan have had few if any side effects.

•	Cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan): Cytoxan works by depleting t cells. It is given in six doses one time per month by IV. Common side effects of Cytoxan given at the protocol dose and frequency for OMS include: low white blood cell count, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and hair thinning. A drug called Zofran can be given to prevent nausea. The doctor prescribing Cytoxan will be closely monitoring your child’s white blood cell counts and will let you know if your child is especially at risk to infection because of immunosuppression. 

•	Mercaptopurine (6-MP): 6-MP also works by suppressing the immune system. It is given in tablet form. In OMS, it can be used as a drug to maintain remission for short periods of time.  Common side effects include: fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Cell counts will also be monitored closely while your child is being treated with 6-MP.

•	Ofatumamab: Ofatumamab is the second generation drug of Rituxan. It works in the same way as Rituxan, but is derived from human protein as opposed to mouse protein. This may make it possible to use as an alternative if your child is allergic to Rituxan. At the time of this writing, Ofatumamab is not FDA approved for use in OMS, but there has been a case in which it was successfully used to treat a child with OMS who was allergic to Rituxan.

 

 
 
==IVIG (Intravenous immunoglobulin):==

IVIG is a pooled blood product containing IgG antibodies extracted from the plasma of over 1000 donors per infusion.  IVIG is thought to work for OMS patients by reducing neuro- inflammation and temporarily “replacing’ defective immunity. The standard dose of IVIG for children with OMS is 1g/kg, a double dose is 2g/kg. The effects of IVIG can last between 2 weeks and 3 months. In children with OMS it is given every 4 weeks, but some children receive infusions more frequently. Parents of children with OMS will often report seeing slight symptoms of disease activity (specifically related behaviors)   return in the week leading up to the next infusion. Before infusion, patients are pre-medicated with Tylenol, Benadryl, and often IV Decadron . These drugs are given to prevent an allergic reaction during infusion and reduce the side effects post infusion. When a child with OMS  begins treatment with ivig, they are often given two doses, back-to-back on two consecutive days. Infusion can take between 6-8 hours to complete depending on the quantity being infused and the rate of infusion. 
IVIG can be given at home, while inpatient at the hospital, or in an outpatient infusion clinic. The decision often depends upon insurance, home health care availability, prescribing doctor, and the parents’ comfort level.  There are several brands of IViG available; the two that are used most often are Gammaguard and Gammunex.

 

==Over the counter supplements==

OMS warriors typically supplement their prescribed medications with over the counter drugs including:'

Vitamin D

Omega 3

Calcium

Multivitamins</text>

'''CHAPTER 9 - OMS RELAPSES AND FLARES'''



==Description==


One of the most difficult and frustrating challenges of raising a child in recovery from acute OMS or living with chronic OMS are relapses. Relapses are symptomatically never severe as the initial acute phase of the disease but can cause some symptoms which had gone away after initial treatment to reappear.  In many cases of relapse treatment can be prescribed to stop it. Relapses are suspected to cause additional injury to the brain including: permanent loss of cognitive ability and functioning, issues with fine motor skills, gross motor skills, behavioral/psych issues and problems with short-term memory. Nearly all children with OMS will relapse (to some degree) at least once, and for many, multiple relapses even into adulthood are probable. 

There are several things which can cause relapses to occur.  Here is a list of the most common causes:

* Reduction in steroid dosage (taper).

* Stopping IViG

* Illness (viral or bacterial) or Infection.

* Stress

* Fluctuations in hormones. (puberty, pregnancy)

* Vaccines, especially live vaccines or any vaccines given during intensive treatment.

==Steroid Taper==

 

The most common causes of relapse in kids recovering from the acute phase of the illness are steroid taper and illness. With relapse due to steroid taper, parents sometimes report being able to taper to a certain point and then seeing breakthrough symptoms. If this is the case, the treating physician will often “bump the dose” back up, past the point that relapse symptoms emerged and prescribe a slower taper. Sometimes this process has to be repeated several times before steroids can be completely discontinued without any symptoms of relapse.  In the event  that a taper without relapse isn’t possible, drugs called “steroid sparers” can sometimes be used to replace the steroid and allow for a successful taper.


==Illness and Infection:==


Colds, flu, and infection can also cause symptoms of relapse because they cause the immune system to go to work in order to fight the illness. Anything that  auses the immune system to go into “fight mode” can potentially cause relapse in kids with OMS, because it is a disease in which the immune system is directly involved.  Because children recovering from the acute phase of the disease are generally undergoing chemotherapy or other forms of immunesupression, they are especially susceptible to illness or infection.  Many parents have reported seeing symptoms of relapse before it is clear that the child is actually sick or has an infection. Often a sharp change in behavior is an indicator of an underlying infection or cold that is brewing. In order to attempt to prevent illness and infection, it is generally advised that all members of the family avoid known exposure to people that are sick, wash hands frequently, and use hand sanitizer. In some
instances, the physician overseeing treatment may also advise that the family avoid large crowds or advise against leaving the home altogether unless absolutely necessary, and the child is wearing a medical mask to protect them from exposure to germs. Other things to watch for are infections in the mouth (prolonged steroid treatment can cause issues with teeth), urinary tract, and small cuts which can easily become infected.


==IViG==


IViG is often one of the last therapies to be discontinued. When the child is finally ready to stop receiving infusions, IViG should be tapered gradually in order to protect against relapse. When tapering IViG, sometimes it is the dose of IViG that is gradually reduced, other times the length of time between infusions is tretched out. The method of IViG taper depends on the physician and his or her preference.


==Stress==



Little is known about how stress can cause symptoms to flare in autoimmune diseases of the central nervous system. Stress is seems to be an issue for older kids with OMS who have recently experienced major life changes (change in school, transition to high school, etc), and should only be considered when other, treatable (illness, infection), causes of relapse have been eliminated.


==Hormonal Fluctuations and Puberty:==




There have been several anecdotal reports of fluctuations in hormones due to onset of puberty or pregnancy causing relapse. Like in the case of stress being the cause of relapse symptoms, efforts should be made to rule out treatable causes before settling on fluctuating hormones as the cause. Consult with the treating physician to discuss treatment in the event of relapse due to hormones.


==Vaccines:==



Children with OMS are advised not to receive vaccines of any kind unless they have had two relapse-free years after treatment has ended.
Vaccines (especially live) can cause the immune system to kick into “fight mode”, and for some kids, this will also trigger relapse.


For children who are still in their first few years of treatment, if any symptoms of disease suddenly reappear, parents should promptly call the treating physician and report the symptoms. The physician should then decide on a plan of action which should include treatment. For older children who suffer from ongoing, chronic, OMS, doctors may take a more casual, “wait and see” approach. Parent of older children may find that a pattern of symptoms emerge with each illness or infection.  While difficult for parents to watch and children to endure, these symptoms will usually go away when the underlying problem goes away without any kind of treatment.</text>

CHAPTER 10 - STANDARD THERAPIES FOR OMS WARRIORS'''


==Description==

Most OMS patients are impaired due to the intensity of the disease and require a variety of therapies.  This chapter is intended to outline common therapy protocols for OMS patients.



Based upon the guidelines of your state, your OMS child may qualify services including Physical, Occupational, and Speech therapies.   Services offered may vary depending on age of the child and the state you reside in.  Most states will use a standard battery of tests to determine services required.  Tests such as the Battelle Developmental Inventory (BDI-2) may be employed to determine eligibility of the child.

It is important that these services include a written plan with measurable results.  This is not only important for parents to track progress with their children, but also serves as an &quot;agreement&quot; between the service provider and parents.   This can become extremely valuable when the state and local agencies are suggesting that services be terminated at some point.   While these governmental agencies do want to provide service to your child, caution must be taken to ensure the immediate and long term needs of the child do not conflict with the government agencies budgetary constraints that are encouraging efforts to move the child out of the program before developmentally ready.

A measureable plan should include:
* Specific tasks designed to improve a specific deficiency
* A brief summary of the course of action to be taken
* A date when the desired objective should be met
* An agreement on the frequency of reviewing the plan
* Signatures by the parents, case worker (or service representative), and the specific care provider(s)

Copies should be kept with the agency and also be given to the parents.

==Physical Therapy==


Mobility of the OMS patient is extremely important because most of these recently diagnosed patients are toddlers in the early stages of development.  After an initial assessment of the child's current developmental state, a physical therapy (PT) program should focus on achieving milestones to get the child's full mobility on track with their peers.   Physical therapists teach kids exercises designed to help them regain strength and range of motion.  The PT program should focus on specific measurable goals to allow the child to improve their gross motor skills (walking, running, jumping) and functional mobility skills.

==Speech Therapy==

A treatment program of speech therapy is very crucial in the development of most OMS children due to the nature of the disease.  It is not uncommon for a child suffering from OMS to lose some or most of their ability to communicate.   This can be extremely difficult for the child and parents as they attempt to communicate with their child on specific needs and problems they are encountering.  

After an initial assessment of the child's current developmental state, a speech therapy (ST) program should focus on achieving milestones to get the child's communication skills on track with their peers.   Speech therapists may determine a short term plan for the child to encourage immediate results as well as a longer term plan to mainstream he child into school and society.  Short term plans may include some basic sing language (baby sign language) to get key communications principles in place for both child and parent.  Longer term, the approach will likely be typical speech therapy encouraging pronunciation and primary principles of speech.

==Occupational Therapy==




Typical growth and development of OMS children can be a tremendous challenge.  Some of the issues include the need to address motor and sensory conflicts, and the teaching of social skills.  Occupational therapy addresses these issues and strives to meet the needs to help children to participate in maeningful life events.   

After an initial assessment of the child's current developmental state, an occupational therapy (OT) program should focus on achieving milestones to get the child into a mainstream environment at school and home.  Occupational therapists address the psychosocial needs of children and youth to enable them to participate in meaningful life events. These occupations may include: normal growth and development, feeding, play, social skills, and education.  They likely will also help families address specific motor and sensory issues that plague OMS children.  These may include sensitivity issues to light, sounds, taste, touch, and comprehension.

'''CHAPTER 14 - INSURANCE'''


==Description==

When a family member is battling OMS, many challenges exist.   One of the most frustrating challenges, at times, may be dealing with medical insurance.   The insurance issues will primarily fall into one of three topics:
* Insurance has not been processed and doctors and medical facilities want payment
* Insurance companies questioning the expensive treatments
* Doctors with minimal experience dealing with OMS, unwilling to prescribe those treatments


Any of these situations potentially delay proper treatment of the OMS patient and can have lasting effects.  The information below is intended to provide some helpful ideas in dealing with these challenges in order to ensure the OMS warrior is getting the proper medical attention.


==Organizing Your Work==



'''''* Tracking Your Bills'''''


If you are new to OMS, get ready for the bills.   You will be dealing with more doctors, labs, hospitals, pharmacies and other specialists and you will need a plan to organize and track your bills.   Be ready to know what got paid, what is being reviewed by insurance, what got denied, and what is being paid by insurance.    You need to know your co-pays and deductibles.   Understand in-network and out-of-network and the ramifications.   Some key rules are:

1. Do not pay your bill until insurance has processed it and the insurance company tells you the amount owed

2. Attach medical bills and insurance &quot;Explanation of Benefits&quot; (EOB) together to track easier

3. Write down what has been paid, what is pending, etc...

4. If insurance is denied, read the EOB, appeal, do not pay the provider until insurance is sorted out

'''''* Filing Your Bills'''''

The key is to organize your information.   Place it in a folder or a three-ring binder.   Keep the bills and insurance statements attached for quick reference.   If you are not the organizing type, ask a friend or family member to assist you in getting it organized.




'''''* Keeping a Log'''''

A final step to organization is to keep a log of correspondance with insurance companies, medical providers, and human resources representatives at your company.   Some of the key components to the log includes&quot;
* Date of the discussion
* Company your called and contact information (telephone number, email address)
* The person you spoke with
* Topic of discussion
* Resolution of the discussion and action items to take place


==Dealing with Insurance Companies==


When battling a disease such as OMS, you need to anticipate a lot of paperwork, a lot of questions, and everyone asking for payment.    Some basic steps to get you ready include:

* Get organized - keep all documents in one place
* Create a list - what, when, how much
* Align bills to insurance statements
* Pay when everything is in order

Once you get that stack of bills sorted and organized, expect the insurance company to kick out bills.   Some of the main reasons for denial include:

* Did not meet the deductible
* Out-of network
* Service not pre-approved
* Treatment is experimental (yes, we get those)
* Insurance company did not have enough information
* The bill was coded wrong or not given pre-approval
* The insurance company thought you had other insurance coverage



Getting insurance denied does not necessarily mean pay the bill.   It means review the bill and follow up if necessary.    Many times, you will find that a coding mistake takes care of the issue.   Sometimes, you just need to stay on the telephone and keep pushing back.  You may need to get your OMS specialist to write a letter to the insurance company to further explain the circumstances.

==Handling Medicaid Issues==


When handling administrators of Medicaid, like insurance, you need to anticipate a lot of paperwork, a lot of questions, and confusion.  You may encounter at times, lost paperwork and case workers who are difficult to reach.

Some basic steps to get you ready include:

* Make copies of everything you file
* Keep a log of who you contacted and when
* Plan to follow up with the case worker
* Align bills to insurance statements



Be prepared to do extra work to get your case handled properly.   You may find that you need to submit requests multiple times due to lost paperwork, find telephone calls unanswered, and may need to ultimately go to the Medicaid office and wait for them to meet with you.  Some resource information to assist you is listed below.

==Tracking Medical Costs for Tax==

The IRS allows medical deductions when doing Itemized Deductions if you meet the threshhold.   For more information on what is allowed when itemizing your medical costs, go to the IRS Publication 502. 

 http://www.irs.gov/publications/p502/ar02.html

==Working with Doctors==

Your local doctor, working with an OMS specialist can make a tremendous difference when sorting through insurance and Medicare issues.   The doctor must be your advocate and not refuse standard treatment protocols of OMS patients such as IViG, Steroids, and chemotherapy due to costs.  While treatment costs may be high, left untreated, the costs of a life of dependant care and treatable issues is higher.</text>

==Description==
OMS warriors need to be very aware of their sodium intake while on medications.  Processed foods and fast foods need to be given in minimal amounts to avoid Cushings Syndrome where the child puffs up from water retention.   Children that are using ACTH typically have a greater likelihood of developing this.   For more information, visits http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cushing's_syndrome .

==Over the counter medicines==
Typically, most OMS warriors are going to have supplements to help them.    Multivitamin,  Calcium,  vitamin D.</text>

'''CHAPTER 17 - EFFECTS OF OMS ON BEHAVIOR'''


==Description==







To say that the behavior problems resulting from active OMS or injury due to OMS are challenging, is an understatement. The behavioral and psychiatric issues associated with OMS can be extremely difficult to treat successfully with conventional methods and medications.  Persistent severe behavior problems as well as serious psychiatric issues are often a lasting effect of OMS; they should be anticipated and steps should be taken to ensure the proper supports and services are in place.



OMS in its acute phase is known to cause severe changes in demeanor and overall mood of once happy and independent children. Many parents report significant changes in behavior in the weeks leading up to the physical symptoms of OMS manifesting. These changes often appear in the form of exaggerated temper tantrums, and mistaken as being part of a developmental phase. 



After the physical symptoms (ataxia, myoclonus, opsoclonus,  and tremor) begin; screaming, flailing, and sometimes biting and pinching, in most cases is constant.  After treatment begins and function is regained behaviors may begin to ease up.  In this stage, interrupted sleep (a common symptom of active disease) can also contribute to behavioral disturbance. Steroid treatment can contribute to behavior problems specifically rage. Some report that in the days following an IVIg infusion there can be an increase in behavior problems specifically rage and high pitched screaming.

==Behavioral Issues that may be Encountered==



''' Children with OMS may exhibit symptoms of the following specific behavioral or psychiatric issues''':



'''* ADHD''': 

May be hyperactive or inattentive or impulsive.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adhd



'''* Oppositional and defiant behavior''': 

Do the opposite of what is asked or expected.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oppositional_defiant_disorder



'''* Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD)''': 

May have obsessions or compulsions. Fixate on doing or having something that is impossible.  Arrange objects in a certain order or a certain way.  Have ritualistic behaviors in which a series of things must occur in a certain order at a certain time. Ex: Multiple hugs and kisses, specific story, several specific stuffed animals, and certain lights on before bed time. If the ritual isn’t properly completed, the child may feel the need to do it again, or have a total meltdown.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocd



'''* Violent behavior''': 

Lash out physically against loved ones, even when aware that doing so is dangerous and wrong.



'''* Bi-Polar Disorder or Mood Disorder''': 

Moods change significantly in short periods of time often without a clear reason.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_disorder_not_otherwise_specified

 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bi-polar_disorder


'''* Separation Anxiety''': 

The child has a meltdown or is incredibly fearful any time you attempt to leave him anywhere or with anyone. He or she may follow you around like a shadow nearly all the time.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_anxiety_disorder


'''* Psychosis''': 

Visual or auditory hallucinations and delusional thoughts. There have been reports of older children with OMS hearing voices and having visual hallucinations.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychosis



'''* Rage Attacks''':  

Prolonged emotional meltdowns which are generally unprovoked (though can seem to be triggered by the child not getting his or her way). They can include high-pitched screaming, back arching and flailing (with little or no regard for personal safety), and can last for hours. Once a rage attack begins there is rarely anything that can be done to end it or soothe the child, it almost has to “burn itself out”. Children will often feel badly about how they behaved after the rage has ended. Some children have reported not being able to remember anything that occurred during the rage attack.
 http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_explosive_disorder

==What is within my child’s control, what isn’t, and how to fix it:==






First and foremost, discuss any significant behavior problems with your child’s treating physician. If they share your concerns they will likely refer your child to be seen by a child psychologist or therapist.



Children with OMS can look and act for the most part like normal kids.  It’s often very difficult for parents and especially others to figure out which behaviors are willful and intentionally manipulative and which are totally out of a child’s control. Parents may feel trapped in an impossible situation where they feel the need to be firm and teach the child how to behave with traditional methods; and having behavioral expectations that they know their children cannot meet, essentially setting them up for failure. 



To change behavior it is essential to have an assessment of the difficulties that may lie behind the behavior. Is there a lack of insight? Is there disinhibition or poor emotional control? Is there a memory problem or does your child have a problem with visual or auditory perception (your child’s interpretation of what is seen or heard)?



In this instance a neuropsychiatric assessment (neuropsych eval) is an invaluable tool. A neuropsych eval is an assessment of a person’s cognition, behavior, and mental status. It measures memory, ability to learn, intelligence, executive function, and language. When you have some understanding of how well your child’s brain is functioning and where the problems are, you can begin to understand what is going on with their behavior and how to help them.



Most children can learn to behave in an acceptable way because it results in rewarding consequences. Children effected by OMS may have lost the cognitive skills needed to respond in this way. In order to respond to consequences and rewards the child must be able to:




'''* Understand cause and effect.'''


'''* Consistently remember what they have to do to avoid punishment or earn rewards.'''


'''* Understand that good behavior may be rewarded at a later time and be patient.'''


'''* Remember the rules and use them in different situations.'''


'''* Control their behavior at will in different situations.'''





If your child demonstrates an understanding of the things listed above and the results of their neuropsych eval reflect that their brain is functioning at a developmentally appropriate level, than it may be that behavior problems are the result of an “emotional” (possibly the result of the trauma of becoming sick and everything that has happened as a result) origin. In this case, it may be useful to obtain a referral to a child psychologist or therapist for cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT is based on the idea that our thoughts cause our feelings and emotions and that if we change our thoughts we can change the way we feel and behave.







If your child cannot do the things listed above and the results of their most recent neuopsych eval reveal significant delays or problems in any area of brain function, the origin of the behavior problems are likely “organic” (either the result of active disease or injury to the brain).  Injury  to the brain can affect your
child’s ability to control their behavior and their awareness of what is acceptable or appropriate at any given time. Speaking with you, in a quiet situation, they may be able to tell you exactly how they should behave, but be incapable of putting that into practice in ‘real life’ circumstances. After an episode of inappropriate behavior, they may be upset about what they have done, but they still can’t help doing it again. Their behavior sometimes ‘winds up’ in a spiral; it is as if the thermostat is missing. CBT may do little or nothing to help in this situation; a better approach may be what is called “Antecedent Behavior Management”. 



Antecedent Behavior Management  is a positive, proactive approach, based on the idea of preventing inappropriate behavior as opposed to dealing with behavior problems after they have happened. The antecedent is what happens before the behavior occurs or what has provoked it. Antecedents can be things
that happen, such as a change in activity, a loud noise or a distraction. It could also be an action such as asking your child to complete a task, giving attention to another child or saying something.



You should seek help from a suitably qualified and experienced psychologist to address significant behavioral problems, but you can also make some changes yourselves. To change your child’s behavior you must first identify exactly what your child does, where and when. This can help you to understand the behavior and involves describing it in specific terms. Saying your child has tantrums does not give any specific information. It may be helpful to draw up a chart and record behavior.



'''''Example'''''



Your child swears and kicks while getting ready for school in the morning. It is a busy time and everyone is getting ready for school or work. You just want your child to get dressed and have their breakfast but when you tell them to do this the tantrum starts. You tell them that they must be ready by a certain time or they cannot watch their favorite TV program that evening. Your child takes no notice and does not do what you tell them. You and the rest of the family become exasperated resulting in a start to the day that is fraught for everyone. Your child has another tantrum when they do not get to watch the TV program later.



'''Antecedent Management''':

One cause of the behavior above is that children affected by OMS may find thinking about more than one thing at a time impossible. The solution is to put something in place before the behavior occurs. In this case a structured routine with one activity at a time. Break down and list the morning activities, making sure all the activities are listed – do not write “eat breakfast” instead list the activities – take bowl from cupboard, take cornflakes from shelf, pour cornflakes into bowl, put packet back on shelf, take milk from fridge, pour onto cornflakes etc. This is initially very time consuming for you as a parent but soon your child will learn to use the checklist and their morning activities will flow. You can modify this approach with a child of any age.  Grab a pad of paper and make a chart (there are also several apps available for smart phones that can help track behavior patterns), make note of when your child has tantrums or issues and what happened right before the meltdown. Maybe your child was hungry, tired, or the sun was shining in his or her eyes. Maybe there was a loud noise, you were brushing her hair or doing something else that caused discomfort that she isn’t able to properly express. When you identify these triggers, you can then anticipate them and plan around them.



'''Safe and compassionate restraint:''':

When a child with OMS is in the midst of a rage attack they may become a danger to themselves or others. It is relatively easy (though still entirely exhausting) to safely restrain a toddler or even 4 or 5 year old for the duration of a rage. Because of the emotional and physical strain caused by having to physically restrain a child with OMS several times a day during rages, some parents have found it helpful to purchase a spare car seat and bolt it to the floor. Place the raging child in the car seat and sit close by keeping an eye on the child until the rage subsides. Some parents have also set aside a room in the home as a “safe room” removing everything from the room, blocking the windows out with foam, and placing padded mats on the floor. With older children proper and safe methods of restraint must be learned and used.  Consult with a specialist to learn the proper methods.



'''Medication''':

In certain instances, psychiatric medication may be prescribed in an attempt to ease the psychiatric and behavior issues of children with OMS. These medications may be helpful but they can potentially cause unwanted side effects and in some children even cause symptoms to worsen. Psych meds should be prescribed cautiously, begun at low doses, and gradually increased. It is very important that only one medication be introduced at a time so that there is no confusion if negative side effects occur.



'''Psychiatric medications that are commonly prescribed to children with OMS for behavior''':

Trazodone: Used in doses ranging from 50 to 150mg before bedtime to help with sleeplessness and in turn reduce day time agitation. Trazodone is actually an anti-depressant but causes extreme drowsiness and sleep. This drug can potentially cause behavior to worsen if a negative effect is noticed discuss this with your physician. Trazodone can also cause akathisia, a movement disorder characterized by the constant need to move the body (specifically the legs) and extreme restlessness. In rare instances cases of priapism have been associated with treatment with Trazodone. 


 
Risperidone: An anti-psychotic medication used to reduce agitation and rage. There have been varying anecdotal reports of success with this medication. Negative side effects of risperidone include: increased agitation, weight gain, cognitive fogginess, lactation (in boys as well as girls), and movement disorders (tardive dyskinesia, akathisia).


 
Medications that are contraindicated (can cause the opposite of the desired effect):


 
Haldol, Tegretol, Trileptal, Lamictal, and benzodiazapines (diazepam, clonazepam, alprazolam).

 


There are many other psychiatric medications that have been tried with both success and failure in children with OMS for mood, agitation, anxiety, and ADHD. What works well for one child may be a disaster for another. Again, what is most important if you are considering using medication to alleviate behavior and psychiatric symptoms is to introduce one medication at a time and begin with small doses working up slowly.



Tips:



'''* You may need to change your behavior (e.g. make lists) for your child to change theirs.'''



'''* Do not ask your child to explain the reasons for his / her inappropriate behavior, children affected by encephalitis often have limited self-awareness and have difficulty analyzing their own behavior.'''



'''* Recognize and respond to initial signs of agitation or inappropriate behavior. Do not let these escalate, because children with behavioral problems following OMS can reach a ‘point of no return’.'''



'''* Avoid non-specific comments such as “behave yourself” or “try being good for a change” which give no clues to how your child should behave. Instead, say exactly what you want them to do.'''



'''* Keep calm, do not over-react, stay in control of your own feelings ,expressing anger or irritability will only make your child more anxious.'''



'''* Maintain eye contact at their level and a low tone of voice.'''



'''* Do not simply react, try to understand the reasons behind the behavior.'''



'''* Focus on strengths, on what your child is able to do. '''


'''* Keep activities structured and organized.'''



'''* Use calendars, timetables and clocks to explain what is going to happen before it happens.'''



'''* Avoid the word “no”. If your child is asking for something or doing something that's inappropriate at that time, just saying 'no' does not help them move on as their thoughts are on that activity. Try using “yes, but”, “Yes, but later”, “yes, but not today” and give a time or a date.'''



'''* It may help to get your child to do something physical to work off emotional tension. Take them for a walk round the block. However, be wary of vigorous exercise if they are ‘wound up’ already. A quiet time with music may then be better.'''



'''* If your child is getting anxious or agitated, try giving them something to occupy their fingers (rubber or a squishy ball) or a sweet to suck or drink with a straw.'''



'''* Make sure your child gets plenty of rest, behavioral problems often become more frequent and intensive when a child is tired.'''



'''* Ignore behavior that is disruptive but not harmful. Make a blank non-smiling face, avoid eye contact and turn away/walk away. But as soon as your child stops the behavior smile and make eye contact, give a hug.'''



'''* Use sincere, meaningful verbal and non-verbal means of communicating your pleasure. Tangible rewards (chocolate or other foodstuffs) do not help teach the value of social reward.'''



'''* Give your child a place of refuge, somewhere calm and safe,  where they can go when they feel overwhelmed.'''



'''* Everyone needs to be in charge of something in their lives. A child with cognitive problems has little control, so behaving badly is one way of gaining some control. Make sure that your child is allowed some control over something appropriate.'''



'''* Show your child, by your actions, how to handle difficulties and get along with others.'''



'''* Behave in the ways you want your child to behave—for example, be caring, empathetic and respectful of others.'''

CHAPTER 20 - FEDERAL, STATE, AND LOCAL SERVICES'''


==Description==

This chapter is intended to provide information to families regarding services provided by the Federal government as well as state and local agencies.



==Federal Services==


This section is intended to provide information to families regarding services provided by the Federal government.  Because many of the medications and treatments/doctor visits can put financial strain on families, below are some federal resources.  Also, consider other members of the family may qualify if they suffer from other conditions. OMS and the related medications may not always be listed, but check for other conditions the OMS child also has, or other family members have.  Keep in mind if you are originally denied for assistance, providing additional explanations and documents in an appeal can help.  Don’t be afraid to ask your hospitals and infusion companies if they provide financial assistance, often times they do for those in need.

CHAPTER 22 - MEDICAL OPTIONS FOR OMS AND NEUROBLASTOMA PATIENTS'''


==Discussion:==

While there is no single definition in the world for rare diseases, OMS easily meets the generally accepted definitions whether in the US, Europe, or Asia.  With that in mind, OMS patients must take care in finding the appropriate medical treatment.  In most instances, OMS patients must realize that the expert is not the local pediatrician, neurologist, or oncologist.   While it is vital to have good local resources to implement the treatment protocol, it is important to allow the OMS specialists and researchers be involved in the diagnosis and development of the treatment protocol to be implemented.  In short, there are likely fewer than 100 doctors and 50 hospitals in the world that should be prescribing the treatment protocol of the patient.

'''To find information on doctors, you can check this website'''  
 http://www.ucomparehealthcare.com 


Below are the lists of some of the more prominent doctors, researchers, and hospitals leading the charge in OMS treatment protocols.  Alignment of these medical resources with the local medical staff willing to implement the protocol will increase the chances for better results.


==OMS Researchers:==

The doctors listed below have worked with numerous OMS patients or have done extensive research in OMS.   Many of these doctors stay connected with one another as treatment protocols mature.  If you need to contact one of these doctors, you can search for their email address on the internet.

CHAPTER 26 - BEST BETS AND OTHER USEFUL INFORMATION'''


==Discussion:==

One thing is sure about OMS; not every OMS child is the same.   What we mean by that is that OMS children will learn in different ways, respond differently to treatments, act in different ways, and require innovative approaches to be successful in life.   We have found that while one child will react positively to a treatment, stimulant, educational approach, or behavior modification, the next child may not.   So, in this chapter we will list some approaches that have been successful at least for some OMS children.    Your results may vary.


==Setting a Regular Baseline for your OMS Child:==

A very important task for all OMS caregivers is to continually have a record of baseline activity for your OMS warrior.  The reason for doing this on a regular basis is two-fold;  in the battle of active OMS, it is easy to forget dates and specific details over time, and once in remission, it is easy to want to forget all of this ever occurred.   However, during the height of the OMS battle, having logs and video is important to ensure the clinician gains a better insight into this OMS warrior.   It is important for remission in the event that a relapse would occur.  In both cases, without established baselines, delays may occur as doctors try to establish that baseline.


One approach is to have a wellness check with your neurologist annually to establish the baseline and to keep the doctor updated on progress.  


Another approach is to prepare a monthly video of key milestones for the OMS warrior.  Most doctors want to see how the eyes are working, use of fine motor skills, gait in walking, speech, and gross motor skills.  The progression of tasks might look something like this:

- With head still, track an object with eyes (left, right, up, down)

- Use left index finger to point to an object

- Use right index finger to point to an object

-  Use left index finger and thumb to pinch the same object

- Use right index finger and thumb to pinch the same object

- Use left index finger and thumb to wind up small toy

- Use right index finger and thumb to wind up small toy

- With left arm outstretched, place safety pin in small bottle

- With right arm outstretched, place safety pin in small bottle

- Close eyes and touch nose with right index finger

- Close eyes and touch nose with left index finger

- Grab small cup of water with right hand and take a sip

- Grab small cup of water with left hand and take a sip

- Place objects into a shape sorter toy

- Identify animals in a picture book

- Sitting on ground, stack 8 blocks with right hand

- Sitting on ground, stack 8 blocks with left hand

- Walk down hall

- Run down hall

- Jump

- Catch a ball

- Throw a ball

- Stand on tip toes

- Kick ball

- Stand on left leg

- Stand on right leg

- Say ABC’s

- Count to 20

- Count backwards from 20

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CHAPTER 27 - OMS CAREGIVERS TIPS AND TRICKS'''


==Description==

Despite treatment protocols, proven medical approaches, and other expert approaches, the day to day care of an OMS warrior often just requires good consistent practices that work in their situation.   This chapter is intended to share some of the approaches that have worked well for some OMS caregivers.


==In Case of Emergency==

* Keep a map in the car of which seat is occupied by the OMS warrior explaining NOT to give medicines to the child without contacting the OMS specialist.

* Put identification on the OMS warrior by using a shoe tag.   Place the tag on the shoe that identifies the OMS warrior and needing special treatments and emergency numbers including parents and OMS specialist.

In this section we will discuss three groups of adverbs.  &lt;br&gt;
1. Adverbs of time: This answers the question of when the act was completed. &lt;br&gt;
2. Adverbs of place: This answers the question of where the act was completed.&lt;br&gt;
3. Adverbs of manner: This answers the question of how the act was completed. &lt;br&gt;

{{Char-ref}}
Filename {{wp|syntax}}es (or name formation) in Trainz assets are heavily restricted for compatibility reasons. As filenames are not displayed to end-users, there is no need for localization support (File and directory paths) or other format class characters.
 
Specifically, filenames within Trainz must obey the following rules:

# Filenames must not begin with a space (' '), a period ('.'), or a tilde ('~').
# Filenames must be at least one character long.
# Filenames must not end with a space (' ').
# Filenames should be kept to a reasonable length. No fixed length is currently enforced, however if compatibility issues arise at a later date N3V Games may add length limits.
# Smart quotes, accents, umlauts and other non-ASCII characters are disallowed.
# Filenames must consist of '''the following ASCII characters &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt;''':

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hinduism is a religion from the Indian sub-continent. Hinduism is a polytheist anthropomorphic '''way of life''' where in most followers tend to practice highly ritualized forms of worship; at the same time the '''Hindu way of life''' offers ample liberty and choice to create or adopt philosophy and/or rituals at individual, family and social group levels. Respect for different perceptions and plurality of thought are essentials. 

People watching Hindu practices from a distance tend to think that Hindu's worship multiple things, the perception is only partially correct since most Hindus accept at back of the mind that the creator is only one. It would be easier to understand usually one finds a Hindu is either just respecting or worshiping different powers or facets of omnipresent creator, the nature around himself and various values he belives in. 


The canon of books and poems that define Hinduism were written in Sanskrit and are of ancient origin. They range from Epics about the lives and loves of the Gods, philosophical treatises on metaphysical questions, and law books. The Hindu religion has provided the roots of Jainism, Sikhism, and Buddhism. In the West it can be found in the Hare Krishna movement. Hinduism is the majority religion of India, Nepal, and Mauritius and a significant minority religion in Fiji, Suriname, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Singapore.</text>

Hello, I am the owner of the global user name Clupus. At the moment I try to get the SUL issue done completed. Thus I would like to take over this user name on en.wikibooks, too. I did not see any contibution of you. So I will ask for usurpation of this account, soon.

'''KIND Scenery-trackside''' provides the basis for all track-attached scenery assets, such as trackside signs and devices.

This asset type inherits all map object characteristics except positioning, and adds trackside positioning and {{TR2|KD|TrackSearch}} semantics.

The {{TR|D|config.txt file}} for a ''KIND Scenery-trackside'' asset has the same ''kind scenery'' entry as {{TR|KD|KIND Scenery}} for historical reasons, however the two kinds are quite distinct and should not be confused. A ''KIND Scenery-trackside'' will contain a ''trackside'' tag, whereas {{TR2|KD|KIND Scenery}} does not.

==KIND Hierarchy==
===Parent Classes===
* {{TR2|KD|KIND Scenery}}
===Child Classes===
* {{TR2|KD|KIND MOSpeedboard}}
* {{TR2|KD|KIND MOSignal}}

==Supported Tags==
Each trackside asset supports the following tags. Each tag is shown here with its default value.

  trackside         0
  speedlimit        0
  buffer-speed      0
  follow-gradient   0
  trackmark         0
  search-limit      0
  placeable-on-splines-of-group
  {
  }

====buffer-speed====
:Type: Decimal
:Desc: Used for buffers, this sets the maximum speed, in meters per second, at which the buffer can stop a train. If the Train passes the track-side object travelling faster than the buffer speed it will derail. If it's traveling below, or equal, to the buffer speed the train will stop harmlessly.
====follow-gradient====
:Type: Boolean

|In this unit we will explore the future tense. There are two ways to use the future tense, which are completely interchangeable. If you are new to Spanish, it will be easier to produce sentences using “informal future.” &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When using “informal future” the second verb stays in its infinitive form. “Ir” is conjugated to match the subject of the sentence and is used the same way “going to” is used in English. For example, I AM GOING TO RUN turns into YO VOY A CORRER.
 
If you are not a beginner, conjugating the verb to include “going to” within the word, can be very rewarding. Don’t be afraid to try it out!&lt;br&gt;

[[Self Self help towards better aging]]

There are over fifty-three million people in England - life expectancy is about eighty; one per-cent of the population has a chance of reaching ninety, nearly a third of those will suffer from dementia. It is expected that, as early testing takes hold (Doctors have this as a new goal), the figures for those with dementia will rise and dementia to be shown developing earlier than previously thought. Dementia is caused by poor blood circulation, an accident to the head, a stroke, or fatty deposits in the blood - all can fluctuate, eventually to restrict blood flow - to block nutriments and oxygen feeding the brain.
There is a relationship between the mind - the way you experience conscience thought, and brain to form judgments. The brain’s cells and neuron connections cause the body to react. Dementia sufferers have short term memory loss caused by these neuron connectors and cells becoming blocked. Some loss of both prevents: completing a sentence, making projections, forming judgments and coherent thoughts, giving focus, allowing perceptive thought – all necessary abilities for daily living. Long-term (varies from patient to patient – within perhaps three years from diagnosis) patients: cannot dress, need toilet supervision are incontinent, nervous, suffer from extremes of happiness, become agitated, over tired, conscience about security and worried about time keeping.
Mental processes can be viewed as physical processes in the nervous system. Any blockage in the arteries has a detrimental affect. It is believed that eventually science will identify what the mind is and how it affects the body. There are touchable stimulations outside the body: minerals, flora, and fauna, also untouchable: gravity, light, solar and space, that cause the mind and body to react. These and other stimulations go towards building full human potential.
Our minds’ move us from place to place… one thought leads to another and the brain’s assimilations change and adapt those thoughts… they are then recorded and stored, ready to alter future thinking. In dementia sufferers these processes all slowly fade away.
To help ourselves fend off dementia we need to consider the following especially those who have a propensity to gain weight, have heart or lung problems, high cholesterol levels, incidences of dementia in the family or suffer from stress. All need to take regular exercise, improve sleep patterns, even if problems are related to genetic faults. Exercise improves heart and lung function which helps transport nutriments and oxygen to the brain. It is the build up of damaging free radicals which oxidize – which develop arterial plaques.
Healthy aging can be facilitated. The object is to develop good habits. Doing things together, in a group, spurs people on: reading, playing, gardening, yoga, talking, viewing… promotes social interaction. Physical activity has many benefits including inducing Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) a secreted protein encoded by the gene – a growth factor found in the brain and its periphery. Take in the sunshine and synthesize vitamin D, help lower your blood pressure.
Take on new resolutions before the next year. Get to bed earlier, get in your eight hours by taking a good book, switch off your phone and computers, and listen to your favorite music. Change your diet, eat less meat and eat more vegetables and fruits, reduce your coffee intake, drink less alcohol, consider intermittent fasting and calorific restriction to induce the production of brain derived Neurotrophic factor.
Keep an eye on what prescription drugs you are taking. If you are having treatment for diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, or for poor thyroid function, check with your doctor. It is believed that high Homocysteine levels in the blood plasma cause cell damage – a key predictor of potential health – a low level risk factor for dementia sufferers, can be affected. This naturally occurring amino acid is part of the body’s process, must be balanced, and is highly dependant on vitamin derived cofactors, and deficiencies in vitamin B12, folic acid, zinc, B6, B2 and trimethylglcine.
There are cognitive tests and training courses (Cognitive Gaming Platforms) set up on the web that can improve cognitive Aging. If you are going to watch the television make sure it’s a happy jolly program for laughing activates your brain. Leave aside violence, stressful and fearful encounters.
Social interaction often assists relaxation, reduces stress, and forms new relationships all good social goals. Those who feel able can volunteer: to give help and purpose, encouragement and pleasure to others, and can satisfy a personal need as well as the need in others, start social networking you’ll feel so much better and may introduce you to a new language or taking up a musical instrument. Look at the letter page of your local newspaper and form an answer, even if you do not send it - the intent alone creates interest and association.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;A Wikibookian believes this page should be split into smaller pages with a narrower subtopic.&quot;

Who would that be then? As an actual reader -as opposed to a tinkerer - I am very happy with the Fortran 77 Tutorial as one html page. Splitting runs the risk of messing up the text. Leave it alone, but if it bothers you that much why not write your own split Fortran 77 book.

== Two-dimensional arrays -- Representation of a 2d array ==

Coming from someone who is used to 2d arrays (x,y) representing the x and y axis, I think that both representations, the current x=rows and y=columns and the alternate, x = x-axis, y = y-axis. Should be displayed. As it might be easier to grasp for some people, thinking about the arrays in that way. If there is a historical significance of teaching the currently live system of arrays, it should be mentioned but possibly both representations given.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== First things first ===
The Advanced Python 3 lessons before you are geared toward furthering your knowledge and abilities with programming using Python. The tutorials are designed to allow you to interact with the Linkbot robots by programming them to move in very specific ways. By seeing the Linkbot respond to your programming commands via code that you write, your abilities to use Python coding will motivate you to learn even more. First, you will just type in the code that is displayed in the tutorial to see how the Linkbot responds. Then, you will make your own changes to that code to play around with the Linkbot's abilities. The worst thing that can happen is that the program won't work and nothing will happen with the robot, so feel free to play with the code. When you are expected to type in code, it will look like this:



&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
##Python is easy to learn
print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

The reason that it will be formatted this way is to make code you need to type easy to distinguish from other text. Additionally, the code will be in color with different parts in different colors to help you see the code's distinct parts. When you enter code, it will not necessarily be in color, but it won't matter as long as you type it the same way that it is written here. 


If the computer prints something out it will be formatted like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
Hello, World!
&lt;/pre&gt;

(Note that printed text goes to your screen, and does not involve paper. Before computers had screens, the output of computer programs would be printed on paper.)

Please notice that these Advanced Python lessons are set up for Python 3, which means that most of the examples will not work in Python 2.7 and previous versions. Additionally, some of the extra lessons created by other programmers like you may not have been converted to Python 3. However, the differences between one version of Python and another are not really large, so if you learn how to code in one version, you should be able to read programs written for the other version without too much difficulty. At some point, you might want to look at the Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 2.6. 


There will often be a mixture of the text you type (which is shown in '''bold''') and the text the program prints on the screen, which would look like this:

 Halt!
 Who Goes there? '''Linkbot'''
 You may pass, Linkbot

These lessons will introduce you to the terminology or vocabulary of programming. For example, programming is also often called '''coding''' or '''hacking'''. By learning the special vocabulary of programming, you will be able to understand what programmers are talking about and sound like a programmer yourself. 


Finally, it's very important for your success with these lessons that you have Python 3 software. If you don't already have the Python software, go to http://www.python.org/download/ and get the Python 3 version for your computer platform. Most likely if you are learning in a classroom, your teacher will already have done this for you beforehand. If not, download it, read the instructions, and install the program.

=== Installing Python and the Linkbot Control Module (PyBarobo) ===
For Python programming, you need a working Python installation and a text editor. Python comes with its own editor ''IDLE'', which is quite nice and sufficient for the beginning programmer. As you get more into programming, you will probably switch to some other editor like ''emacs'', ''vi'' or another editor.

The Python download page is: [http://www.python.org/download http://www.python.org/download]. The most recent version is Python 3.4.2 (as of 18th October 2014); '''Python 2.7 and older versions will not work with this tutorial'''. There are various different installation files for different computer platforms available on the download site. Here are some specific instructions for the most common operating systems:

==== Ubuntu Linux Users ====
To install everything you need to run this curriculum, which includes Python 3, Python 3 setup tools, and the Barobo Python package, make sure you have an internet connection and run these commands in a terminal window:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-setuptools python3-numpy idle3
sudo easy_install3 pybarobo
&lt;/pre&gt;

You will also have to add your user account to the &quot;dialout&quot; group. You can do this by using the command:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
&lt;/pre&gt;
The above command will add whatever user you are logged in as to the &quot;dialout&quot; group. If you wish to add a user account that is not the one that is logged in, replace &quot;$USER&quot; with the user name of the other account. You may have to log out and log back in for the change to take effect.

For other distributions of Linux, follow the instructions provided by either your distribution or on the Python website to get [http://www.python.org Python 3], [http://www.numpy.org NumPy], and [https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyBarobo PyBarobo] installed.

==== Raspberry Pi (Raspbian) Users ====
Raspbian comes with Python 3 and numpy installed by default. To get the Raspberry Pi ready to control the Linkbot, make sure your Pi is connected to the internet and type the following commands:
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
sudo easy_install3 pybarobo
&lt;/pre&gt;
You may have to log out and log back in again for the changes to take effect.

==== Mac users ====
Starting from Mac OS X (Tiger), Python ships by default with the operating system, but you will need to update to Python 3 until OS X starts including Python 3 (check the version by starting &lt;tt&gt;python3&lt;/tt&gt; in a command line terminal). Also IDLE (the Python editor) might be missing in the standard installation. If you want to (re-)install Python, get the MacOS installer from the [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-341/ Python download site].

==== Windows users ====
Download the appropriate Windows installer (the [https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.2/python-3.4.2.msi x86 MSI installer], if you do not have a 64-bit AMD or Intel chip). Even if you do have a 64-bit chip, I would still recommend downloading the 32-bit version because some of the Barobo Linkbot libraries are pre-built for 32-bit system by default. Start the installer by double-clicking it and follow the prompts. Be sure to include the optional package &quot;pip&quot;, which can come in handy for installing additional Python modules and add-ons.

{{Message box|heading = Note! | message = 
The latest Python 3.4.2 installer can help set your path for you. If you are installing Python 3.4.2 on Windows, select ''Install for all users''. There will be an installation step called ''Customize Python 3.4.2'' . During this step, if you scroll down to the last entry of customizable options, you will see an option that reads ''Add python.exe to Path''. By default, this setting is set to ''Entire feature will be unavailable''. Change the install setting to ''Will be installed on the local hard drive'' to automatically add Python to your path. Once this is done, you will no longer need to follow the instructions in the following section titled &quot;Configuring your PATH environment variable&quot;
}}

Next, you will need to install a driver, which is available here: [https://http://my.barobo.com/download/linkbot_windows_driver Installer].  Follow the link, download the file and run it.
Once Python is installed and the path is configured, open a windows command prompt and type the following command:
&lt;pre&gt;
pip install pybarobo
&lt;/pre&gt;

See https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#installing-python for more information.

===== Configuring your PATH environment variable =====

The PATH environment variable is a list of folders, separated by semicolons, in which Windows will look for a program whenever you try to execute one by typing its name at a Command Prompt. You can see the current value of your PATH by typing this command at a Command Prompt:

&lt;tt&gt;echo %PATH%&lt;/tt&gt;

The easiest way to permanently change environment variables is to bring up the built-in environment variable editor in Windows.  How you get to this editor is slightly different on different versions of Windows.

On Windows 8: Press the Windows key and type &lt;tt&gt;Control Panel&lt;/tt&gt; to locate the Windows Control Panel.  Once you've opened the Control Panel, select View by: Large Icons, then click on &lt;tt&gt;System&lt;/tt&gt;.  In the window that pops up, click the &lt;tt&gt;Advanced System Settings&lt;/tt&gt; link, then click the &lt;tt&gt;Environment Variables...&lt;/tt&gt; button.

On Windows 7 or Vista: Click the Start button in the lower-left corner of the screen, move your mouse over &lt;tt&gt;Computer&lt;/tt&gt;, right-click, and select &lt;tt&gt;Properties&lt;/tt&gt; from the pop-up menu. Click the &lt;tt&gt;Advanced System Settings&lt;/tt&gt; link, then click the &lt;tt&gt;Environment Variables...&lt;/tt&gt; button.

On Windows XP: Right-click the &lt;tt&gt;My Computer&lt;/tt&gt; icon on your desktop and select &lt;tt&gt;Properties&lt;/tt&gt;. Select the &lt;tt&gt;Advanced&lt;/tt&gt; tab, then click the &lt;tt&gt;Environment Variables...&lt;/tt&gt; button.

Once you've brought up the environment variable editor, you'll do the same thing regardless of which version of Windows you're running. Under &lt;tt&gt;System Variables&lt;/tt&gt; in the bottom half of the editor, find a variable called &lt;tt&gt;PATH&lt;/tt&gt;. If there is is one, select it and click &lt;tt&gt;Edit...&lt;/tt&gt;. Assuming your Python root is C:\Python34, add these two folders to your path (and make sure you get the semicolons right; there should be a semicolon between each folder in the list):

&lt;tt&gt;C:\Python34
C:\Python34\Scripts&lt;/tt&gt;

Note:
If you want to double-click and start your Python programs from a Windows folder and not have the console window disappear, you can add the following code to the bottom of each script:

&lt;tt&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
#stops console from exiting
end_prog = &quot;&quot;
while end_prog != &quot;q&quot;:
        end_prog = input(&quot;type q to quit&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Interactive Mode ===
Go into IDLE (also called the Python GUI). You should see a window that has some text like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
Python 3.0 (r30:67503, Dec 29 2008, 21:31:07) 
[GCC 4.3.2 20081105 (Red Hat 4.3.2-7)] on linux2
Type &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license()&quot; for more information.

    ****************************************************************
    Personal firewall software may warn about the connection IDLE
    makes to its subprocess using this computer's internal loopback
    interface.  This connection is not visible on any external
    interface and no data is sent to or received from the Internet.
    ****************************************************************
    
IDLE 3.0      
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is Python's way of telling you that you are in
interactive mode. In interactive mode what you type is immediately
run. Try typing &lt;code&gt;1+1&lt;/code&gt; in. Python will respond with &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;.
Interactive mode allows you to test out and see what Python will do.
If you ever feel you need to play with new Python statements, go into
interactive mode and try them out.

=== Creating and Running Programs ===

Go into IDLE if you are not already. In the menu at the top, select &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;New Window&lt;/code&gt;. In the new window that appears, type the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Now save the program: select &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; from the menu, then &lt;code&gt;Save&lt;/code&gt;. Save it as &quot;&lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt;&quot; (you can save it in any folder you want). Now that it is saved it can be run. Just a Rookies note here, if you change a program, save it with a version notation like &lt;code&gt;helloV1.py&lt;/code&gt; that way you won't change your original program that worked. 

Next run the program by going to &lt;code&gt;Run&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;Run Module&lt;/code&gt; (or if you have an older version of IDLE use &lt;code&gt;Edit&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;Run script&lt;/code&gt;). This will output &lt;code&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;*Python Shell*&lt;/code&gt; window. 

For a more in-depth introduction to IDLE, a longer tutorial with screenshots can be found at [http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/python/idle_intro/index.html http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/python/idle_intro/index.html]

==== Program file names ====
It is very useful to stick to some rules regarding the file names of Python programs. Otherwise some things ''might'' go wrong unexpectedly. These don't matter as much for programs, but you can have weird problems if you don't follow them for module names (modules will be discussed later).
# Always save the program with the extension &lt;tt&gt;.py&lt;/tt&gt;. Do not put another dot anywhere else in the file name.
# Only use standard characters for file names: letters, numbers, dash (&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;) and underscore (&lt;tt&gt;_&lt;/tt&gt;).
# White space (&quot;&lt;tt&gt; &lt;/tt&gt;&quot;) should not be used at all (use underscores instead).
# Do not use anything other than a letter (particularly no numbers!) at the beginning of a file name.
# Do not use &quot;non-english&quot; characters (such as &lt;tt&gt;ä&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;ö&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;ü&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;å&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;ß&lt;/tt&gt;) in your file names—or, even better, do not use them at all when programming.

=== Using Python from the command line ===
If you don't want to use Python from the command line, you don't have to, just use IDLE. To get into interactive mode just type &lt;code&gt;python3&lt;/code&gt; without any arguments. To run a program, create it with a text editor (Emacs has a good Python mode) and then run it with &lt;code&gt;python3 program_name&lt;/code&gt;.

Additionally, to use Python within Vim, you may want to visit [http://wiki.python.org/moin/Vim Python wiki page about VIM]

==== Running Python Programs in *nix ====

If you are using Unix (such as Linux, Mac OS X, or BSD), if you make the program executable with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod chmod], and have as the first line:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python3
&lt;/source&gt;
you can run the python program with &lt;code&gt;./hello.py&lt;/code&gt; like any other command.

=== Where to get help ===
At some point in your Python career you will probably get stuck and have no clue about how to solve the problem you are supposed to work on. This tutorial only covers the basics of Python programming, but there is a lot of further information available.

==== Python documentation ====
First of all, Python is very well documented. There might even be copies of these documents on your computer, which came with your Python installation:
* The official [http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ Python 3 Tutorial] by Guido van Rossum is often a good starting point for general questions.
* For questions about standard modules (you will learn what this is later), the [http://docs.python.org/3/library/ Python 3 Library Reference] is the place to look at.
* If you really want to get to know something about the details of the language, the [http://docs.python.org/3/reference/ Python 3 Reference Manual] is comprehensive but quite complex for beginners.

==== Python user community ====


There are a lot of other Python users out there, and usually they are nice and willing to help you. Before you ask the Python user community a question, everyone will appreciate it if you ''do a web search for a solution to your problem before contacting the community''. This very active user community is organized mostly through mailing lists and a newsgroup:

* The [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor tutor mailing list] is for people who want to ask questions regarding how to learn computer programming with the Python language.
* The [http://www.python.org/community/lists/#python-help python-help mailing list] is python.org's help desk. You can ask a group of knowledgeable volunteers questions about all your Python problems.
* The Python newsgroup [news:comp.lang.python comp.lang.python] ([http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/ Google groups archive]) is the place for general Python discussions, questions, and the central meeting point of the community.
* Python wiki has a [http://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups list of local user groups], you can join the group mailing list and ask questions. You can also participate in the user group meetings.

&lt;!-- Now for our first lesson, what is a computer program?  A computer program is a set of very detailed instructions that tell a computer what to do.   --&gt;
=== What you should know ===
Once you've completed this chapter, you will know how to edit programs in a '''Python Editor''', IDLE 3, or some other text editor, save them, and run them.

=== Printing ===

Since the beginning of programming tutorials, &quot;Hello World!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Computer Programming/Hello world|Here]] is a great list of the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program in many programming languages. Just so that you know how simple Python can be...&lt;/ref&gt; has been the first foray into creating something on the screen, here is how to do it with Python:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

If you are using the command line to run this program, then type it in a text editor, save it as &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt; and run it with &lt;code&gt;python3.0 hello.py&lt;/code&gt;

Otherwise go into your Python Editor, create a new file (Ctrl + N for IDLE), and create the program as
in section [[Learning Python 3 with the Barobo Linkbot/Intro#Creating_and_Running_Programs|Creating and Running Programs]].

When this program is run here's what it prints:

 Hello, World!

Remember, whenever you see code as an example, it's a good idea for you to type it in and run it.  Learning by doing can be a powerful tool!  It is worth the time it takes.

Here is a modified 'Hello World' using the Linkbot to say hello. Comments are added to help you understand what the code is doing step by step.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo   #loads 'barobo' module
import time     #loads 'time' module

dongle = barobo.Dongle()  #uses commands from 'barobo' to connect Linkbot
dongle.connect()
robotID = input('Enter Linkbot ID: ')  #prompts user for Linkbot ID
robot = dongle.getLinkbot(robotID)

print ( 'Hello Linkbot Programmer' )   #prints greeting

robot.setBuzzerFrequency(1047)     #calls for pizo buzzer to make a tone
time.sleep(0.25)                   #sets duration of tone
robot.setBuzzerFrequency(1567)     #changes tone
time.sleep(0.5)
robot.setBuzzerFrequency(0)        #turns off tone.
&lt;/source&gt;

Feel free to chance the frequency of the buzzer to change the tone, and the duration of time.sleep to see what that does to the greeting.

Now here is are a few more program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;I pledge allegiance to the flag&quot;)
print(&quot;of the United States of America,&quot;)
print(&quot;and to the republic, for which it stands,&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

When you run this program it prints out:

 I pledge allegiance to the flag
 of the United States of America,
 and to the republic, for which it stands,

When the computer runs this program it first sees the '''line''' (like one sentence of code):

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;I pledge allegiance to the flag&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

so the computer prints:

 I pledge allegiance to the flag

Then the computer goes down to the next line and sees:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;of the United States of America,&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

So the computer prints to the screen:

 of the United States of America,

The computer keeps looking at each line, follows the command and then goes on to the next line.  The computer keeps running commands until it reaches the end of the program.
==== Controlling a Linkbot LED Color ====
Linkbots are equipped with a multi-color LED, which is basically just a light that can change colors.
Lets try a simple program to control the LED color on a Linkbot. To get started, follow these steps:
* Turn on your Linkbot by holding down the power button until the Linkbot flashes a bright red light.
* After about 5 seconds, the Linkbot will beep and show a blue light. Your Linkbot is now on!
* Take a Micro-USB cable and connect the Linkbot to your computer.
* Open your text editor and try the following code:https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Learning_Python_3_with_the_Barobo_Linkbot
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo
myDongle = barobo.Dongle()
myDongle.connect()
myLinkbot = myDongle.getLinkbot()

myLinkbot.setLEDColor(0, 255, 0)
&lt;/source&gt;
{{Message box|heading = Note: | message=
Don't worry too much if you don't understand what's going on in the first four lines of this program. All of those concepts will be covered in later chapters. For now, just know that if you want to control a Barobo Linkbot, those four lines (or similar lines) are necessary.
}}
When you run this program, you should notice that your Linkbot turned green! In the code that you wrote, there were three numbers: 0, 255, and 0. These three numbers determine the brightness of the red, green, and blue LEDs inside the linkbot, where 0 denotes the lowest brightness setting and 255 the maximum setting. If you want to try making your Linkbot a brilliant purple color, try setting the color numbers to &quot;255, 0, 255&quot;. This tells the Linkbot to turn on its red and blue LED's to their maximum brightness. When the red light blends with the blue light, it appears purple!

==== Terminology ====
Now is probably a good time to give you a bit of an explanation of what is happening - and a little bit of programming terminology.

What we were doing above was using a '''function''' called &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;.  The function's name - &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; - is followed by parentheses containing zero or more '''arguments'''.  So in this example

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

there is one argument, which is &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.  Note that this argument is a group of characters enclosed in double quotes (&quot;&quot;).  This is commonly referred to as a string of characters, or '''string''', for short.  Another example of a string is &lt;code&gt;&quot;Jack and Jill went up a hill&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.  The combination of a function and parentheses with the arguments is a '''function call'''.

A function and its arguments are one type of statement that python has, so

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

is an example of a statement.  Basically, you can think of a statement as a single line in a program.  

That's probably more than enough terminology for now.

=== Expressions ===
Here is another program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;2 + 2 is&quot;, 2 + 2)
print(&quot;3 * 4 is&quot;, 3 * 4)
print(&quot;100 - 1 is&quot;, 100 - 1)
print(&quot;(33 + 2) / 5 + 11.5 is&quot;, (33 + 2) / 5 + 11.5)
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is the ''output'' when the program is run:

 2 + 2 is 4
 3 * 4 is 12
 100 - 1 is 99
 (33 + 2) / 5 + 11.5 is 18.5

As you can see, Python can turn your thousand-dollar computer into a five-dollar calculator.

In this example, the print function is followed by two arguments, with each of the arguments separated by a comma.  So with the first line of the program

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;2 + 2 is&quot;, 2 + 2)
&lt;/source&gt;

The first argument is the string &lt;code&gt;&quot;2 + 2 is&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and the second argument is the ''mathematical expression'' &lt;code&gt;2 + 2&lt;/code&gt;, which is commonly referred to as an ''expression''.

What is important to note is that a string is printed as is (without the enclosing double quotes), but an ''expression'' is ''evaluated'', or converted to its actual value.

Python has seven basic operations for numbers: 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Operation 
! Symbol 
! Example
|-
|Power (exponentiation)
| &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; 
| &lt;code&gt;5 ** 2 == 25&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|Multiplication 
| &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; 
|&lt;code&gt;2 * 3 == 6&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|Division 
| &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; 
| &lt;code&gt;14 / 3 == 4.666666666666667&lt;/code&gt; 
|-
|Integer Division
| &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;14 // 3 == 4&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|Remainder (modulo)
| &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; 
| &lt;code&gt;14 % 3 == 2&lt;/code&gt; 
|-
|Addition 
| &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; 
| &lt;code&gt;1 + 2 == 3&lt;/code&gt; 
|-
|Subtraction 
| &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; 
| &lt;code&gt;4 - 3 == 1&lt;/code&gt;
|}

Notice that there are two ways to do division, one that returns the repeating decimal, and the other that can get the remainder and the whole number.  
The order of operations is the same as in math:
* parentheses &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;
* exponents &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt;
* multiplication &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, division &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, integer division &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;, and remainder &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; 
* addition &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and subtraction &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;
So use parentheses to structure your formulas when needed.

=== Talking to humans (and other intelligent beings) ===

Often in programming you are doing something complicated and may not in the future remember what you did.  When this happens the program should probably be commented.  A ''comment'' is a note to you and other programmers explaining what is happening.  For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Not quite PI, but a credible simulation
print(22 / 7)
&lt;/source&gt;

Which outputs

 3.14285714286

Notice that the comment starts with a hash: &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;. Comments are used to communicate with others who read the program and your future self to make clear what is complicated.

Note that any text can follow a comment, and that when the program is run, the text after the &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; through to the end of that line is ignored. The &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; does not have to be at the beginning of a new line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Output PI on the screen
print(22 / 7) # Well, just a good approximation
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Examples ===
Each chapter (eventually) will contain examples of the programming features introduced in the chapter.  You should at least look over them and see if you understand them.  If you don't, you may want to type them in and see what happens.  Mess around with them, change them and see what happens.  

'''Denmark.py'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.&quot;)
print(&quot;                -- Shakespeare&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:

 Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.
                 -- Shakespeare

'''School.py'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This is not quite true outside of USA
# and is based on my dim memories of my younger years
print(&quot;Firstish Grade&quot;)
print(&quot;1 + 1 =&quot;, 1 + 1)
print(&quot;2 + 4 =&quot;, 2 + 4)
print(&quot;5 - 2 =&quot;, 5 - 2)
print()
print(&quot;Thirdish Grade&quot;)
print(&quot;243 - 23 =&quot;, 243 - 23)
print(&quot;12 * 4 =&quot;, 12 * 4)
print(&quot;12 / 3 =&quot;, 12 / 3)
print(&quot;13 / 3 =&quot;, 13 // 3, &quot;R&quot;, 13 % 3)
print()
print(&quot;Junior High&quot;)
print(&quot;123.56 - 62.12 =&quot;, 123.56 - 62.12)
print(&quot;(4 + 3) * 2 =&quot;, (4 + 3) * 2)
print(&quot;4 + 3 * 2 =&quot;, 4 + 3 * 2)
print(&quot;3 ** 2 =&quot;, 3 ** 2)
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:

 Firstish Grade
 1 + 1 = 2
 2 + 4 = 6
 5 - 2 = 3
 
 Thirdish Grade
 243 - 23 = 220
 12 * 4 = 48
 12 / 3 = 4
 13 / 3 = 4 R 1
 
 Junior High
 123.56 - 62.12 = 61.44
 (4 + 3) * 2 = 14
 4 + 3 * 2 = 10
 3 ** 2 = 9

=== Input and Variables ===
You are now ready to create a more complicated program.  Type the following into your Python Editor:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Halt!&quot;)
user_input = input(&quot;Who goes there?&quot;)
print(&quot;You may pass,&quot;,  user_input)
&lt;/source&gt;

Run your program to ensure that it displays the following:

 Halt!
 Who goes there? '''Linkbot'''
 You may pass, Linkbot

''Note: After running the code by pressing F5 on your keyboard, the Python Shell will only give the output:''

 Halt!
 Who goes there?

''Enter your name in the Python Shell and press enter for the remainder of the output.''

Your program will look different because of the &lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt; statement.  Notice that, when running the program, you must type your name and press 'Enter'.  The program responds by displaying text that includes your name.  This is an example of '''''input'''. The program reaches a certain point, and then waits for the user to type more data for the program to include''.

The user's data that the program includes is stored as a '''variable'''.  In the previous program &lt;code&gt;user_input&lt;/code&gt; is a ''variable''.  A variable is like a box that can store a piece of data.  This program demonstrates the use of variables:

(Helpful blurb, Aaron, &quot;This may not make a lot of sense right now, but refer back to it as you read the paragraph about variables.&quot;)

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 123.4
b23 = 'Barobo'
first_name = &quot;Linkbot&quot;
b = 432
c = a + b
print(&quot;a + b is&quot;,c)
print(&quot;first_name is&quot;,first_name)
print(&quot;The Linkbot was created by &quot;,b23)
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is the output:

 a + b is 555.4
 first_name is Linkbot
 The Linkbot was created by Barobo

Variables store data, such as a number, a word, a phrase, or anything you choose to make it. The variables in the above program are &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b23&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;first_name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;. The two basic types of variables are '''numbers''' and '''strings'''.  '''''Numbers''' are simply a mathematical, numerical number, such as 7 or 89 or -3.14.'' In the above example, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;code&gt;, and even &lt;code&gt;c&lt;code&gt; are number variables. &lt;code&gt;c&lt;code&gt; is considered a number variable because the result is a number. '''''Strings''' are a sequence of letters, numbers and other characters''. In this example &lt;code&gt;b23&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;first_name&lt;/code&gt; are variables that store strings. &lt;code&gt;Barobo&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Linkbot&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a + b is&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;first_name is&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;The Linkbot was created by&lt;/code&gt; are the strings in this program.  The characters are surrounded by &lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;.  The other types of symbols used in the program are variables representing numbers.  Remember that variables are used to store a value, they do not use punctuation marks (&lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'&lt;code&gt;). If you want to use an actual ''value'', you ''must'' use those punctuation marks. See the next example.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
value1 == Pim
value2 == &quot;Pim&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Both lines of code look the same at first glance, but they are different. In the first one, Python checks if the value stored in the variable &lt;code&gt;value1&lt;/code&gt; is the same as the value stored in the ''variable'' &lt;code&gt;Pim&lt;/code&gt;. In the second one, Python checks if the string (the actual letters &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;) are the same as in &lt;code&gt;value2&lt;/code&gt; (More explanation about strings and about the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; come later).

=== Assignment ===

In review, there are boxes called variables, and data goes into those boxes. Recall the previous examples. The computer sees a line such as &lt;code&gt;first_name = &quot;Linkbot&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, and it reads it as &quot;put the string &lt;code&gt;Linkbot&lt;/code&gt; into the box, or variable, &lt;code&gt;first_name&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Then the computer sees the statement &lt;code&gt;c = a + b&lt;/code&gt;, and it reads it as &quot;put the sum of &lt;code&gt;a + b&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;123.4 + 432&lt;/code&gt; which equals &lt;code&gt;555.4&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. The right hand side of the statement &lt;code&gt;a + b&lt;/code&gt; is '''evaluated''', meaning that the two terms are equal, and the result is stored in the variable on the left hand side &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;. In other words, one side of the statement is '''assigned''' to the other side. This process is called '''assignment'''. 

One single equal sign in coding makes the line of code a grammatical statement. For example, &lt;code&gt;apple = banana&lt;code&gt; reads &quot;apple is banana.&quot; By writing the code in this way, apple is assigned to banana, and they are now considered equal by the program.You are basically telling the program that the two terms are equal, even if that is not in actuality the case.

Two equal signs together makes the line of code into a question that the computer will answer. For example, &lt;code&gt;apple == banana&lt;code&gt; reads &quot;is apple equal to banana?&quot; This answer would be &quot;no,&quot; of course, unless you have previously and incorrectly assigned apple to banana.  
 
(Helpful blurb, Aaron, &quot;Be careful how many &lt;code&gt;=&lt;code&gt; you use because it can change your program entirely!&quot;)

Here is another example of variable usage:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 1
print(a)
a = a + 1
print(a)
a = a * 2
print(a)
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is the output:

 1
 2
 4

Even if the same variable appears on both sides of the equals sign (e.g., spam = spam), the computer still reads it as, &quot;First find out the data to store, and then find out where the data goes.&quot;

Try another program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
number = float(input(&quot;Type in a number: &quot;))
integer = int(input(&quot;Type in an integer: &quot;))
text = input(&quot;Type in a string: &quot;)
print(&quot;number =&quot;, number)
print(&quot;number is a&quot;, type(number))
print(&quot;number * 2 =&quot;, number * 2)
print(&quot;integer =&quot;, integer)
print(&quot;integer is a&quot;, type(integer))
print(&quot;integer * 2 =&quot;, integer * 2)
print(&quot;text =&quot;, text)
print(&quot;text is a&quot;, type(text))
print(&quot;text * 2 =&quot;, text * 2)
&lt;/source&gt;

The output should be:

 Type in a number: '''12.34'''
 Type in an integer: '''-3'''
 Type in a string: '''Hello'''
 number = 12.34
 number is a &lt;class 'float'&gt;
 number * 2 = 24.68
 integer = -3
 integer is a &lt;class 'int'&gt;
 integer * 2 = -6
 text = Hello
 text is a &lt;class 'str'&gt;
 text * 2 = HelloHello

Notice that &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; was created with &lt;code&gt;float(input())&lt;/code&gt; while &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; was created with &lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt;. 
&lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt; returns a string while the function &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; returns a number from a string. &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; returns an integer, that is a number with no decimal point.  When you want the user to type in a decimal use &lt;code&gt;float(input())&lt;/code&gt;, if you want the user to type in an integer use &lt;code&gt;int(input())&lt;/code&gt;, but if you want the user to type in a string use &lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt;.

The second half of the program uses the &lt;code&gt;type()&lt;/code&gt; function which identifies a variable's type. Numbers are of type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, which are
short for ''integer'' and ''floating point'' (mostly used for decimal numbers), respectively. Text strings are of type &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt;, short for ''string''. Integers and floats can be worked on by mathematical functions, strings cannot. Notice how when python
multiplies a number by an integer the expected thing happens. However
when a string is multiplied by an integer the result is that multiple
copies of the string are produced (i.e., &lt;code&gt;text * 2 = HelloHello&lt;/code&gt;).

Operations with strings do different things than 
operations with numbers. As well, some operations only work with numbers (both integers and floating point numbers) and will give an error if a string is used. Here are some interactive mode examples
to show that some more.

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;This&quot; + &quot; &quot; + &quot;is&quot; + &quot; joined.&quot;)
This is joined.
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Ha, &quot; * 5)
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, 
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Ha, &quot; * 5 + &quot;ha!&quot;)
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, ha!
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(3 - 1)
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;3&quot; - &quot;1&quot;)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here is the list of some string operations:

=== Moving a Linkbot's Motor ===
Each Linkbot has two joints that it can move to do a variety of tasks. Sometimes, there might be wheels attached to the joints so that the Linkbot can drive around like a two-wheeled car. Or, the joints might be attached to a gripper, which would allow a Linkbot to pick up objects. 

Each joint on a Linkbot has a number printed into the plastic. Looking at the Linkbot directly from a &quot;top down&quot; view, joint 1 is on the left side, joint 2 faces you, and joint 3 is on the right hand side. The Linkbot-L only has joints 1 and 2 and the Linkbot-I only has joints 1 and 3. Lets learn how to move a joint on a Linkbot!

'''moveMotor.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This program moves Joint 1 on a Linkbot by an amount 
# specified by the user
import barobo
myDongle = barobo.Dongle()
myDongle.connect()
robotID = input('Enter Linkbot ID: ')
myLinkbot = myDongle.getLinkbot(robotID)

degrees = float(input(&quot;Degrees to rotate Joint 1: &quot;))
myLinkbot.moveJoint(1, degrees)
&lt;/source&gt;

When you run this example, you should notice joint 1 move. If you typed &quot;90&quot; for the input, you should see the joint rotate counter-clockwise 90 degrees. If you typed &quot;-90&quot;, you should see the joint move 90 degrees in the clockwise direction. When you run this program, be careful about entering very large numbers or else you might have to wait a while for the joint to stop moving.

=== Examples ===

'''Rate_times.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This program calculates rate and distance problems
print(&quot;Input a rate and a distance&quot;)
rate= float(input(&quot;rate: &quot;))
distance = float(input(&quot;Distance: &quot;))
print(&quot;Time:&quot;, (distance / rate))
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample runs:

 Input a rate and a distance
 Rate: '''5'''
 Distance: '''10'''
 Time: 2.0

 Input a rate and a distance
 Rate: '''3.52'''
 Distance: '''45.6'''
 Time: 12.9545454545

'''Area.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This program calculates the perimeter and area of a rectangle
print(&quot;Calculate information about a rectangle&quot;)
length = float(input(&quot;Length: &quot;))
width = float(input(&quot;Width: &quot;))
print(&quot;Area:&quot;, length * width)
print(&quot;Perimeter:&quot;, 2 * length + 2 * width)
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample runs:

 Calculate information about a rectangle
 Length: '''4'''
 Width: '''3'''
 Area: 12.0
 Perimeter: 14.0

 Calculate information about a rectangle
 Length: '''2.53'''
 Width: '''5.2'''
 Area: 13.156
 Perimeter: 15.46

'''Temperature.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This program converts Fahrenheit to Celsius
fahr_temp = float(input(&quot;Fahrenheit temperature: &quot;))
print(&quot;Celsius temperature:&quot;, (fahr_temp - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0)
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample runs:

 Fahrenheit temperature: '''32'''
 Celsius temperature: 0.0

 Fahrenheit temperature: '''-40'''
 Celsius temperature: -40.0

 Fahrenheit temperature: '''212'''
 Celsius temperature: 100.0

 Fahrenheit temperature: '''98.6'''
 Celsius temperature: 37.0

}}

Write a program that gets 2 number variables from the user; each one an angle in degrees. After the program gets the two numbers, it makes the Linkbot rotate joint 1 by the amount in the first number, and then joint 3 (or 2, if you have a Linkbot-L) by the second number.

=== While loops ===
Ordinarily the computer starts with the first line and then goes down from there.  ''Control structures'' change the order that statements are executed or decide if a certain statement will be run.  Here's the source for a program that uses the while control structure:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 0            # FIRST, set the initial value of the variable a to 0(zero).
while a &lt; 10:    # While the value of the variable a is less than 10 do the following:
    a = a + 1    # Increase the value of the variable a by 1, as in: a = a + 1! 
    print(a)     # Print to screen what the present value of the variable a is.
                 # REPEAT! until the value of the variable a is equal to 9!? See note. 
                 
                 # NOTE:
                 # The value of the variable a will increase by 1
                 # with each repeat, or loop of the 'while statement BLOCK'.
                 # e.g. a = 1 then a = 2 then a = 3 etc. until a = 9 then...
                 # the code will finish adding 1 to a (now a = 10), printing the 
                 # result, and then exiting the 'while statement BLOCK'. 
                 #              --
                 # While a &lt; 10: |
                 #     a = a + 1 |&lt;--[ The while statement BLOCK ]
                 #     print (a) |
                 #              --
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is the extremely exciting output: 

 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
 10

(And you thought it couldn't get any worse after turning your computer into a five-dollar calculator?)

So what does the program do?  First it sees the line &lt;code&gt;a = 0&lt;/code&gt; and sets &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to zero. Then it sees &lt;code&gt;while a &lt; 10:&lt;/code&gt; and so the computer checks to see if &lt;code&gt;a &lt; 10&lt;/code&gt;. The first time the computer sees this statement, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is zero, so it is less than 10. In other words, as long as &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is less than ten, the computer will run the tabbed in statements. This eventually makes &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; equal to ten (by adding one to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; again and again) and the &lt;code&gt;while a &lt; 10&lt;/code&gt; is not true any longer. Reaching that point, the program will stop running the indented lines.

Always remember to put a colon &quot;''':'''&quot; at the end of the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; statement line!

Here is another example of the use of &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 1
s = 0
print('Enter Numbers to add to the sum.')
print('Enter 0 to quit.')
while a != 0:                           
    print('Current Sum:', s)            
    a = float(input('Number? '))        
    s = s + a                            
print('Total Sum =', s)
&lt;/source&gt;

 Enter Numbers to add to the sum.
 Enter 0 to quit.
 Current Sum: 0
 Number? '''200'''
 Current Sum: 200.0
 Number? '''-15.25'''
 Current Sum: 184.75
 Number? '''-151.85'''
 Current Sum: 32.9
 Number? '''10.00'''
 Current Sum: 42.9
 Number? '''0'''
 Total Sum = 42.9

Notice how &lt;code&gt;print 'Total Sum =', s&lt;/code&gt; is only run at the end. The &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; statement only affects the lines that are indented with whitespace. The &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; means does not equal so &lt;code&gt;while a != 0:&lt;/code&gt; means as long as &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is not zero run the tabbed statements that follow. 

Note that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is a floating point number, and not all floating point numbers can be accurately represented, so using &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; on them can sometimes not work.  Try typing in 1.1 in interactive mode. 

==== Infinite loops or Never Ending Loop====
Now that we have while loops, it is possible to have programs that run forever. An easy way to do this is to write a program like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
while 1 == 1:
   print(&quot;Help, I'm stuck in a loop.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

The &quot;&lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; operator is used to test equality of the expressions on the two sides of the operator, just as &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; was used for &quot;less than&quot; before (you will get a complete list of all comparison operators in the next chapter).

This program will output &lt;code&gt;Help, I'm stuck in a loop.&lt;/code&gt; until the heat death of the universe or you stop it, because 1 will forever be equal to 1.  The way to stop it is to hit the Control (or ''Ctrl'') button and ''C'' (the letter) at the same time.  This will kill the program.  (Note: sometimes you will have to hit enter after the Control-C.) On some systems, nothing will stop it, short of killing the process--so avoid!

=== Examples ===
==== Fibonacci sequence ====
'''Fibonacci-method1.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence
a = 0
b = 1
count = 0
max_count = 20

while count &lt; max_count:
    count = count + 1
    print(a, end=&quot; &quot;)  # Notice the magic end=&quot; &quot; in the print function arguments  
                       # that keeps it from creating a new line.
    old_a = a    # we need to keep track of a since we change it.
    a = b
    b = old_a + b
print()  # gets a new (empty) line.
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:
 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181

Note that the output is on a single line because of the extra argument &lt;code&gt;end=&quot; &quot;&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; arguments.

'''Fibonacci-method2.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Simplified and faster method to calculate the Fibonacci sequence
a = 0
b = 1
count = 0
max_count = 10

while count &lt; max_count:
    count = count + 1
    print(a, b, end=&quot; &quot;)  # Notice the magic end=&quot; &quot;
    a = a + b    
    b = a + b
print()  # gets a new (empty) line.
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:
 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987 1597 2584 4181

==== Enter password ====
'''Password.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Waits until a password has been entered.  Use Control-C to break out without
# the password

#Note that this must not be the password so that the 
# while loop runs at least once.
password = str()

# note that != means not equal
while password != &quot;unicorn&quot;:
    password = input(&quot;Password: &quot;)
print(&quot;Welcome in&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;


Sample run:
 Password: '''auo'''
 Password: '''y22'''
 Password: '''password'''
 Password: '''open sesame'''
 Password: '''unicorn'''
 Welcome in

==== A Linkbot Musical Example ====
The Linkbot has a small buzzer on board that can play one note at a time. We can control the frequency of the buzzer on the Linkbot to generate different tones. The equation
&lt;math&gt; \mathrm{pianokeyFrequency} = 2^{((\mathrm{key}-49)/12)}*440 &lt;/math&gt; shows how to calculate the frequency of a key on a piano. There are 88 keys on a real piano, but lets see if we can make our robot play from the 34th key all the way up to the 73rd key.

In Python, to calculate the &quot;power&quot; of a number, we can use the &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; operator. For instance, &lt;math&gt;2^3&lt;/math&gt; can be calculated in Python using &lt;code&gt;2**3&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo
dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect()
robotID = input('Enter Linkbot ID: ')
robot = dongle.getLinkbot(robotID) 
import time       # imports the Python &quot;time&quot; module because we want to use &quot;time.sleep()&quot; later.
key=34            # Set key=34 which is the 34th key on a piano keyboard.
while key &lt; 74:   # While the key number is less than 74.
    robot.setBuzzerFrequency(2**((key-49)/12.0)*440)  # Play the frequency to the corresponding note.
    time.sleep(.25)   # Play the note for 0.25 seconds.
    robot.setBuzzerFrequency(0)  # Turn off the note
    key=key+1         # Increase the key number by 1. This is the end of the loop. At this point,
                      # Python will check to see if the condition in the &quot;while&quot; statement,
                      # &quot;key &lt; 74&quot;, is true. If it is still true, Python will go back to the 
                      # beginning of the loop. If not, the program exits the loop.
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Exercises ===
Write a program that asks the user for a Login Name and password.  Then when they type &quot;lock&quot;, they need to type in their name and password to unlock the program.
{{Solution|title=Solution|text=

Write a program that asks the user for a Login Name and password.  Then when they type &quot;lock&quot;, they need to type in their name and password to unlock the program.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
name = input(&quot;What is your UserName: &quot;)
password = input(&quot;What is your Password: &quot;)
print(&quot;To lock your computer type lock.&quot;)
command = None
input1 = None
input2 = None
while command != &quot;lock&quot;:
    command = input(&quot;What is your command: &quot;)
while input1 != name:
    input1 = input(&quot;What is your username: &quot;)
while input2 != password:
    input2 = input(&quot;What is your password: &quot;)
print(&quot;Welcome back to your system!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

If you would like the program to run continuously, just add a &lt;code&gt;while 1 == 1:&lt;/code&gt; loop around the whole thing.
You will have to indent the rest of the program when you add this at the top of the code, but don't worry, you don't have to do it manually for each line! Just highlight everything you want to indent and click on &quot;Indent&quot; under &quot;Format&quot; in the top bar of the python window.

Another way of doing this could be:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
name = input('Set name: ')
password = input('Set password: ')
while 1 == 1:
    nameguess=&quot;&quot;
    passwordguess=&quot;&quot;
    key=&quot;&quot;
    while (nameguess != name) or (passwordguess != password):
        nameguess = input('Name? ')
        passwordguess = input('Password? ')
    print(&quot;Welcome,&quot;, name, &quot;. Type lock to lock.&quot;)
    while key != &quot;lock&quot;:
        key = input(&quot;&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice the &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; in while &lt;code&gt;(nameguess != name) or (passwordguess != password)&lt;code&gt;, which we haven't yet introduced. You can probably figure out how it works.

Modify the Linkbot Buzzer program to play every third key on the piano from the 34th key up to the 74th key.

{{Solution|title=Solution|text=

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo
dongle = barobo.Dongle()

robotID = input('Enter Linkbot ID: ')
robot = dongle.getLinkbot(robotID) 
import time       # imports the Python &quot;time&quot; module because we want to use &quot;time.sleep()&quot; later.
key=34            # Set key=34 which is the 34th key on a piano keyboard.
while key &lt; 74:   # While the key number is less than 74.
    robot.setBuzzerFrequency(2**((key-49)/12.0)*440)  # Play the frequency to the corresponding note.
    time.sleep(.25)   # Play the note for 0.25 seconds.
    robot.setBuzzerFrequency(0)  # Turn off the note
    key=key+3         # Increase the key number by 3. This is the end of the loop. At this point,
                      # Python will check to see if the condition in the &quot;while&quot; statement,
                      # &quot;key &lt; 74&quot;, is true. If it is still true, Python will go back to the 
                      # beginning of the loop. If not, the program exits the loop.
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== If statement ===
As always I believe I should start each chapter with a warm-up typing exercise, so here is a short program to compute the absolute value of an integer:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
n = int(input(&quot;Number? &quot;))
if n &lt; 0:
   print(&quot;The absolute value of&quot;, n, &quot;is&quot;, -n)
else:
   print(&quot;The absolute value of&quot;, n, &quot;is&quot;, n)
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is the output from the two times that I ran this program:

 Number? '''-34'''
 The absolute value of -34 is 34

 Number? '''1'''
 The absolute value of 1 is 1

So what does the computer do when it sees this piece of code?  First it prompts the user for a number with the statement &quot;&lt;code&gt;n = int(input(&quot;Number? &quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.  Next it reads the line &quot;&lt;code&gt;if n &lt; 0:&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. If &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is less than zero Python runs the line &quot;&lt;code&gt;print(&quot;The absolute value of&quot;, n, &quot;is&quot;, -n)&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Otherwise it runs the line &quot;&lt;code&gt;print(&quot;The absolute value of&quot;, n, &quot;is&quot;, n)&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.  

More formally Python looks at whether the ''expression'' &lt;code&gt;n &lt; 0&lt;/code&gt; is true or false.  An &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement is followed by an indented ''block'' of statements that are run when the expression is true.  Optionally after the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement is an &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; statement and another indented ''block'' of statements.  This second block of statements is run if the expression is false.  

There are a number of different tests that an expression can have.  Here is a table of all of them:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!operator 
!function
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt; 
|less than
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;=&lt;/code&gt; 
|less than or equal to
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; 
|greater than
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; 
|greater than or equal to
|-
|&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; 
|equal
|-
|&lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; 
|not equal
|}

Another feature of the &lt;code&gt; if&lt;/code&gt; command is the &lt;code&gt; elif &lt;/code&gt; statement.  It stands for else if and means if the original &lt;code&gt; if&lt;/code&gt; statement is false but the &lt;code&gt; elif&lt;/code&gt; part is true, then do the &lt;code&gt;elif&lt;/code&gt; part. And if neither the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;elif&lt;/code&gt; expressions are true, then do what's in the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; block. Here's an example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 0
while a &lt; 10:
    a = a + 1
    if a &gt; 5:
        print(a, &quot;&gt;&quot;, 5)
    elif a &lt;= 3:
        print(a, &quot;&lt;=&quot;, 3)
    else:
        print(&quot;Neither test was true&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

and the output:

 1 &lt;= 3
 2 &lt;= 3
 3 &lt;= 3
 Neither test was true
 Neither test was true
 6 &gt; 5
 7 &gt; 5
 8 &gt; 5
 9 &gt; 5
 10 &gt; 5

Notice how the &lt;code&gt;elif a &lt;= 3&lt;/code&gt; is only tested when the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement fails to be true. There can be more than one &lt;code&gt;elif&lt;/code&gt; expression, allowing multiple tests to be done in a single &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement.

=== Moving a Linkbot's Motors ===
In the previous chapter, 
[[../Who Goes There?/]], we saw that you can move a linkbot's motor with the &lt;code&gt;moveJoint()&lt;/code&gt; function.
It is typically used like:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
myLinkbot.moveJoint(1, 180)
&lt;/source&gt;
where the first argument is the motor you want to move and the second argument is the angle in degrees you want to move it. The above code will move motor &quot;1&quot; in the positive direction by 180 degrees.

What if you want to move more than one motor at a time? The linkbot also has a &lt;code&gt;move()&lt;/code&gt; function that does just that. It looks something like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
myLinkbot.move(90, 180, 270)
&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;move()&lt;/code&gt; function expects three numbers inside the parentheses. The first number is the angle to move motor 1, the second number is the angle to move motor 2, and the third number is the angle to move motor 3. If your Linkbot only has two motors, the value
for the face that does not have a motor is ignored. For example, if I have a Linkbot-I and I ran the above sample code, the &quot;180&quot; is ignored because motor 2 is not a movable motor. Instead, the Linkbot will move motor 1 forward 90 degrees and motor 3 forward 270 degrees.

When the &lt;code&gt;move()&lt;/code&gt; function is executed, the Linkbot will move any/all of its motors simultaneously.

==== command_linkbot.py ====
In this example, we'd like to create a program that we can use to move our Linkbot around. 
This demo will use the python &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; command. 
In the previous chapter, we saw that Python can get stuck in &quot;infinite loops&quot;. 
The &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; command can be used to exit loops even if the loop condition is still true.

Lets start with just moving the Linkbot forward and backward first.
To run this demo, you'll need a Linkbot-I and two wheels. A caster is also recommended but optional.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo
dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect()
myLinkbot = dongle.getLinkbot('abcd') # Replace abcd with your Linkbot's serial ID

while True: # This is an infinite loop. Get out by using the &quot;break&quot; statement
    command = input('Please enter a robot command or &quot;quit&quot; to exit the program: ')
    if command == 'forward':
        # Rotate the wheels 180 degrees to move the robot forward
        myLinkbot.move(180, 0, -180) # Motor 3 has to spin in the negative direction to move the robot forward
    elif command == 'backward':
        myLinkbot.move(-180, 0, 180)
    elif command == 'quit':
        break
    else:
        print('I\'m sorry. I don\'t understand that command.')

print('Goodbye!')
&lt;/source&gt;

'''A Note on Strings'''

You might have noticed that towards the end of the program, there is a line that reads &lt;code&gt;print('I\'m sorry. I don\'t understand that command.')&lt;/code&gt; with funny backslashes in the code. When you run the program though, it doesn't print those backslashes. These backslashes actually serve an important purpose. 

When Python encounters either a single quote ' or double quote &quot; , it knows that what follows will be a string that is terminated by the same type of quotation mark that started it. But, what if we want to include some quotation marks as part of the string? Consider the following piece of code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
mystring = &quot;Hello there. My dog says &quot;woof!&quot; when he's bored.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
When Python sees the first Quotation mark at &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello th...&lt;/code&gt;, it says &quot;Ok, this is going to be a string and as soon as I see another quotation mark, that will be the end of the string&quot;. Soon, Python sees another quotation mark at &lt;code&gt;...says &quot;woof!&lt;/code&gt; and thinks &quot;I've found the end of the string!&quot;, but this is not the end of our string! We wanted Python to go all the way to the end at &lt;code&gt;...bored.&quot;&lt;/code&gt; . How do we tell Python that the quotation marks around &lt;code&gt;&quot;woof!&quot;&lt;/code&gt; are special, and that our string doesn't actually end there? 

The answer is backslashes. If there is a backslash preceding a quotation mark, that is a special indicator to Python to include that quotation mark as part of the string, rather than terminating the string. Therefore, the fixed code should be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
mystring = &quot;Hello there. My dog says \&quot;woof!\&quot; when he's bored.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
In this example, the single quote in &lt;code&gt;he's&lt;/code&gt; is automatically included as part of the string because the string started with a double-quotation mark, and thus Python is looking for a double-quotation mark to terminate the string.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== What is debugging? ===
:&quot;As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't as easy  to get programs right as we had thought.  Debugging had to be discovered.  I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.&quot; &amp;mdash; ''Maurice Wilkes discovers debugging'', 1949

By now if you have been messing around with the programs you have probably found that sometimes the program does something you didn't want it to do.  This is fairly common.  Debugging is the process of figuring out what the computer is doing and then getting it to do what you want it to do.  This can be tricky.  It surprisingly common to spend weeks tracking down and fixing a bug that was caused by someone putting an &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; where a &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; should have been.  

This chapter will be more abstract than previous chapters.

=== What should the program do? ===

The first thing to do (this sounds obvious) is to figure out what the
program should be doing if it is running correctly.  Come up with some
test cases and see what happens.  

For instance, lets try to write a program that rolls a Linkbot-I with two wheels forward one rotation while making the LED green, and then rolls the Linkbot backward with the LED red. Here's a first try at this program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo
dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect()
myLinkbot = dongle.getLinkbot('ABCD') # Change 'ABCD' to your Linkbot's Serial ID

myLinkbot.moveNB(360, 0, -360)    # Roll Forward
myLinkbot.setLEDColor(0, 255, 0)  # Set LED to green
myLinkbot.moveNB(-360, 0, 360)    # Roll Backward
myLinkbot.setLEDColor(255, 0, 0)  # Set the LED color to red
&lt;/source&gt;

At first glance, the above program may appear to be correct. When you actually try it though, you'll see that the robot never turns its LED green, and it never moves forward. It immediately changes its LED red and moves backward. What happened to the two lines that are supposed to make the robot roll forward and turn the LED green?

One easy and powerful method of debugging problems like this is to use the &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; function to track the progress of the program while it's running. Lets try adding some print statements to our original program and see if we can track down the problem:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo
dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect()
myLinkbot = dongle.getLinkbot('ABCD') # Change 'ABCD' to your Linkbot's Serial ID

print(&quot;Moving forward...&quot;)
myLinkbot.moveNB(360, 0, -360)    # Roll Forward
print(&quot;Done. Setting LED to green...&quot;)
myLinkbot.setLEDColor(0, 255, 0)  # Set LED to green
print(&quot;Done. Moving backward...&quot;)
myLinkbot.moveNB(-360, 0, 360)    # Roll Backward
print(&quot;Done. Setting LED to red...&quot;)
myLinkbot.setLEDColor(255, 0, 0)  # Set the LED color to red
print(&quot;Done.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

When you run this program, pay attention not only to what it's printing, but also how and when it's printing. When you run the program, the output you should get is:
&lt;pre&gt;
Moving forward...
Done. Setting LED to green...
Done. Moving backward...
Done. Setting LED to red...
Done.
&lt;/pre&gt;
However, you'll notice that all of those statements print &lt;i&gt;immediately&lt;/i&gt;; there is no delay between the commands that tell the robot to move forward and the commands that tell it to move backward. That should immediately give us an indication for what is wrong: the program should wait until the robot is finished moving forward before moving backward and turning red. You'll notice that we used non-blocking movement functions in our program so that we can move and change the LED color at the same time. However, we also know that Python doesn't stop and wait at non-blocking and &quot;set&quot; functions. From the previous chapter, we also have a function that makes Python wait until a non-blocking motion is completed called &lt;code&gt;moveWait()&lt;/code&gt;.
Lets try fixing our broken program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo
dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect()
myLinkbot = dongle.getLinkbot('ABCD') # Change 'ABCD' to your Linkbot's Serial ID

myLinkbot.moveNB(360, 0, -360)    # Roll Forward
myLinkbot.setLEDColor(0, 255, 0)  # Set LED to green
myLinkbot.moveWait()              # Wait until the robot is finished rolling forward
myLinkbot.moveNB(-360, 0, 360)    # Roll Backward
myLinkbot.setLEDColor(255, 0, 0)  # Set the LED color to red
&lt;/source&gt;

A &lt;code&gt;moveWait()&lt;/code&gt; statement has been added in-between the two steps. This forces Python to wait until the robot is done moving forward before telling it to move backward and set the LED color to red. 

Without the &lt;code&gt;moveWait()&lt;/code&gt; statement, Python will go through all of those statements &lt;i&gt;so fast&lt;/i&gt; that the robot rolling forward and green LED won't be noticeable to human eyes and ears. Only the last commands, rolling backward and the red LED, &quot;stay&quot; on the robot and are observable, making it seem like Python was skipping the moving forward and green LED altogether.

=== General Tips ===

# This may sound obvious, but the first thing to ensure is that you know what the program is supposed to do.
# Check to make sure the program flow is correct by using &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; statements.
# Check to make sure variable values are correct using &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; statements.
# For complex programs that might use loops and variables, try &quot;stepping&quot; through the program, line by line, keeping track of variable values and program outputs using pen and paper.
# If you have a long program that does many calculations on a variable and the value of the variable is wrong at the end of the program, try using the &quot;binary-search&quot; method to find the bug: Use a &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; statement to check the value of the variable in the middle of the program. If the value is correct, you know the bug is somewhere in the second half of your program. Put another &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; statement in the middle of the second half of the program and check its value. Repeat until you've found the incorrect line of code that is incorrectly setting the variable's value. This technique is highly useful for finding &lt;i&gt;where&lt;/i&gt; a bug might be occurring, and it is useful for many types of bugs.

{{Message box|heading=Advanced Programmers:| message=
You can put &quot;breakpoints&quot; and check variable values without adding &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; statements in your code using various debuggers, such as pdb: the Python debugger. You can read more about it [[https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/pdb.html here]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Creating Functions ===
To start off this chapter I am going to give you an example of what you could do but shouldn't (so don't type it in):
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
a = 23
b = -23

if a &lt; 0:
    a = -a
if b &lt; 0:
    b = -b
if a == b:
    print(&quot;The absolute values of&quot;, a, &quot;and&quot;, b, &quot;are equal.&quot;)
else:
    print(&quot;The absolute values of&quot;, a, &quot;and&quot;, b, &quot;are different.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

with the output being:

 The absolute values of 23 and 23 are equal.

The program seems a little repetitive. Programmers hate to repeat things -- that's what computers are for, after all! (Note also that finding the absolute value changed the value of the variable, which is why it is printing out 23, and not -23 in the output.) Fortunately Python allows you to create functions to remove duplication.  Here is the rewritten example:
&lt;source lang=python&gt;
a = 23
b = -23

def absolute_value(n):
    if n &lt; 0:
        n = -n
    return n

if absolute_value(a) == absolute_value(b):
    print(&quot;The absolute values of&quot;, a, &quot;and&quot;, b, &quot;are equal.&quot;)
else:
    print(&quot;The absolute values of&quot;, a, &quot;and&quot;, b, &quot;are different.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

with the output being:

 The absolute values of 23 and -23 are equal.

The key feature of this program is the &lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt; statement.  &lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt;
(short for define) starts a function definition.  &lt;code&gt;def&lt;/code&gt; is
followed by the name of the function &lt;code&gt;absolute_value&lt;/code&gt;.  Next comes a '(' followed by the parameter &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; (&lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is passed from the program into the function when the function is called).  The statements after the ':' are executed when the function is used.  The statements continue until either the indented statements end or a &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is encountered.  The &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement returns a value back to the place where the function was called. We already have encountered a function in our very first program, the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; function.  Now we can make new functions.  

Notice how the values of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are not changed.
Functions can be used to repeat tasks that don't return
values.  Here are some examples:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def hello():
    print(&quot;Hello&quot;)

def area(width, height):
    return width * height

def print_welcome(name):
    print(&quot;Welcome&quot;, name)

hello()
hello()

print_welcome(&quot;Fred&quot;)
w = 4
h = 5
print(&quot;width =&quot;, w, &quot; height =&quot;, h, &quot; area =&quot;, area(w, h))
&lt;/source&gt;

with output being:

 Hello
 Hello
 Welcome Fred
 width = 4  height = 5  area = 20

That example shows some more stuff that you can do with
functions.  Notice that you can use no arguments or two or more.
Notice also when a function doesn't need to send back a value, a
return is optional.
&lt;!-- Functions can be used to eliminate repeat code. --&gt;

=== Variables in functions ===
When eliminating repeated code, you often have variables in the repeated code.  In Python, these are dealt with in a special way.  So far all variables we have seen are global variables.  Functions have a special type of variable called local variables.  These variables only exist while the function is running.  When a local variable has the same name as another variable (such as a global variable), the local variable hides the other.  Sound confusing?  Well, these next examples (which are a bit contrived) should help clear things up.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 4
 
def print_func():
    a = 17
    print(&quot;in print_func a = &quot;, a)

print_func()
print(&quot;a = &quot;, a)
&lt;/source&gt;

When run, we will receive an output of:

 in print_func a = 17
 a = 4

Variable assignments inside a function do not override global variables, they exist only inside the function.  Even though &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; was assigned a new value inside the function, this newly assigned value was only relevant to &lt;code&gt;print_func&lt;/code&gt;, when 
the function finishes running, and the &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;'s values is printed again, we see the originally assigned values.

Here is another more complex example.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a_var = 10
b_var = 15
e_var = 25

def a_func(a_var):
    print(&quot;in a_func a_var = &quot;, a_var)
    b_var = 100 + a_var
    d_var = 2 * a_var
    print(&quot;in a_func b_var = &quot;, b_var)
    print(&quot;in a_func d_var = &quot;, d_var)
    print(&quot;in a_func e_var = &quot;, e_var)
    return b_var + 10

c_var = a_func(b_var)

print(&quot;a_var = &quot;, a_var)
print(&quot;b_var = &quot;, b_var)
print(&quot;c_var = &quot;, c_var)
print(&quot;d_var = &quot;, d_var)
&lt;/source&gt;

{{Solution|title=Output|text=
&lt;pre&gt;
 in a_func a_var =  15
 in a_func b_var =  115
 in a_func d_var =  30
 in a_func e_var =  25
 a_var =  10
 b_var =  15
 c_var =  125
 d_var = 
 
 Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;C:\def2.py&quot;, line 19, in &lt;module&gt;
    print(&quot;d_var = &quot;, d_var)
NameError: name 'd_var' is not defined
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}
In this example the variables &lt;code&gt;a_var&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b_var&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;d_var&lt;/code&gt; are all local variables when they are inside the function &lt;code&gt;a_func&lt;/code&gt;.  After the statement &lt;code&gt;return b_var + 10&lt;/code&gt; is run, they all cease to exist. The variable &lt;code&gt;a_var&lt;/code&gt; is automatically a local variable since it is a parameter name.  The variables &lt;code&gt;b_var&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;d_var&lt;/code&gt; are local variables since they appear on the left of an equals sign in the function in the statements &lt;code&gt;b_var = 100 + a_var&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;d_var = 2 * a_var&lt;/code&gt; .

Inside of the function &lt;code&gt;a_var&lt;/code&gt; has no value assigned to it.  When the function is called with &lt;code&gt;c_var = a_func(b_var)&lt;/code&gt;, 15 is assigned to &lt;code&gt;a_var&lt;/code&gt; since at that point in time &lt;code&gt;b_var&lt;/code&gt; is 15, making the call to the function &lt;code&gt;a_func(15)&lt;/code&gt;.  This ends up setting &lt;code&gt;a_var&lt;/code&gt; to 15 when it is inside of &lt;code&gt;a_func&lt;/code&gt;.

As you can see, once the function finishes running, the local variables
&lt;code&gt;a_var&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b_var&lt;/code&gt; that had hidden the global variables of the same name are gone.  Then the statement &lt;code&gt;print(&quot;a_var = &quot;, a_var)&lt;/code&gt; prints the value &lt;code&gt;10&lt;/code&gt; rather than the value &lt;code&gt;15&lt;/code&gt; since the local variable 
that hid the global variable is gone.  

Another thing to notice is the &lt;code&gt;NameError&lt;/code&gt; that happens at the end.  This appears since the variable &lt;code&gt;d_var&lt;/code&gt; no longer exists since &lt;code&gt;a_func&lt;/code&gt; finished.  All the local variables are deleted when the function exits.  If you want to get something from a function, then you will have to use &lt;code&gt;return something&lt;/code&gt;.

One last thing to notice is that the value of &lt;code&gt;e_var&lt;/code&gt; remains unchanged inside &lt;code&gt;a_func&lt;/code&gt; since it is not a parameter and it never appears on the left of an equals sign inside of the function &lt;code&gt;a_func&lt;/code&gt;.  When a global variable is accessed inside a function it is the global variable from the outside.

Functions allow local variables that exist only inside the function and 
can hide other variables that are outside the function.

=== Linkbots in Functions : Making the Linkbot Move a Certain Distance ===
We've seen now that we can pass numbers and variables to a function in the function parameters. 
It turns out that you can pass just about anything into a function, including Linkbot objects.
In the Chapter &quot;[[../Decisions/]]&quot;, we wrote some code that could move a two-wheels linkbot around. 
In the code, we specified the angle to rotate the wheels, but it would be much cooler if we could tell the Linkbot to move some distance on the ground. 
When you're writing new functions, it's common to prototype how the function might be used before actually writing it, so lets try that now.
We want our function to be used something like this: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
driveDistance(myLinkbot, 10) # Drive a wheeled Linkbot 10 inches forward
&lt;/source&gt;

Now that we're satisfied with how we want to '''use''' our function, now we have to worry about how to actually write it so that it does what we want it to do. 
First, let us catalog what we know and what we have. So far we know about 2 functions that we can use to move motors on the Linkbot: &lt;code&gt;moveJoint()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;move()&lt;/code&gt;. Of the two, we have found that &lt;code&gt;move()&lt;/code&gt; is probably better for driving two-wheeled Linkbots. However, the &lt;code&gt;move()&lt;/code&gt; function takes angles as arguments. That leaves the question: How do we turn a distance into an angle?

It turns out there is an equation that you can use to figure out how many degrees a wheel has to turn to travel a certain distance. The equation is:
&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{degrees} = \frac{360}{2\pi r} * \mathrm{distance}
&lt;/math&gt;

If you would like to see a derivation where that equation comes from, click on the &quot;derivation&quot; link below.

{{Solution | title=Derivation | text=

To solve this question, we can consider how wheels roll on a surface. Let us consider a wheel rolling on a surface that doesn't slip on the surface because it will make our calculations easier. Let us consider the &quot;circumference&quot; of a wheel. 
If you took a string and wrapped it all the way around a circle, the length of that string is the &quot;circumference&quot;.
The circumference of a circle with radius &quot;r&quot; is

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{circumference} = 2 \pi r
&lt;/math&gt;

The following figure illustrates a blue wheel with a green string wrapped around it. As the wheel rolls, the string unrolls off of the wheel.
[[File:Wheel circumference.png|thumb|center|upright=2.0|The relationship between the distance traveled by a wheel and its circumference.]]

As we can see from the figure, if the wheel rolls one full revolution, it travels one circumference of distance. Knowing that one revolution is 360 degrees, we can write a ratio:

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{360}{2\pi r} = \frac{\mathrm{degrees}}{\mathrm{distance}}
&lt;/math&gt;

So if we want to travel a distance &quot;distance&quot;, we can do

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{degrees} = \frac{360}{2\pi r} * \mathrm{distance}
&lt;/math&gt;

Using this equation, if we know the wheel radius and we know what distance we want to travel, we can calculate the degrees to turn the wheel! Now we can write our function.

{{Message box|heading = Note! | message = 
For you math nerds out there, you might also know that the &quot;arc-length&quot; of a circle is 

&lt;math&gt; 
l = r \theta
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; is expressed in radians. Solving for &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; gives

&lt;math&gt;
\theta = \frac{l}{ r}
&lt;/math&gt;

Converting &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; to degrees, we get

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{degrees} = \frac{l}{r} * \frac{360}{2\pi}
&lt;/math&gt;

which is exactly the same as our previous result!
}}
}}

Now, we can include that equation in our function. This allows us to re-use the function for any distance and we don't have to type in the equation over and over again.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo
import math # So that we can use math.pi
dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect() 
myLinkbot = dongle.getLinkbot('abcd') # Change abcd to your Linkbot's serial ID

def driveDistance(linkbot, distance):
    r = 3.5 / 2 # If you have a wheel that's not 3.5 inches in diameter, change &quot;3.5&quot; to the diameter of your wheel
    degrees = (360) / (2 * math.pi * r) * distance
    linkbot.move(degrees, 0, -degrees)

driveDistance(myLinkbot, 10) # Drives the Linkbot 10 inches forward
driveDistance(myLinkbot, -5) # Drives the Linkbot 5 inches backward
&lt;/source&gt;

The program shown above uses the &lt;code&gt;driveDistance()&lt;/code&gt; function to drive a robot forward 10 inches and then backward 5 inches. You might wondering why we went through all the trouble of defining a function, which took four lines of code, when we could accomplish the same task without functions. 
* Consider if the task was much more complex than just two movements. If you have to drive the robot forwards and backwards more than 4 times, you are actually saving time and code by using a function. 
* Writing repeated code via copy/paste can be very hard to debug. Imagine if you copy and pasted the equation 20 times for 20 robot movements, and then you found a bug in the copy-pasted code. You would have to correct the bug in each one of the 20 pasted code blocks. If you had written a function with a bug in it, you would only have to fix the equation inside the function.
* If you are writing code for someone else to use, it would make sense to encapsulate your code in a function. Imagine if you are working with a team of people and your job is to write a function that moves the robot forward and backward, another person's job is to write a function that turns the robot, and a third person has to write a function that changes the LED color. You could then take all three functions and put them into a single program and have a robot that accurately drives a certain distance, turns, and changes LED color.

=== Examples ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">Some people find this section useful, and some find it confusing.  If you find it confusing you can skip it.  Now we will do a walk through for the following program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def mult(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return 0
    rest = mult(a, b - 1)
    value = a + rest
    return value
print(&quot;3 * 2 = &quot;, mult(3, 2))
&lt;/source&gt;
 
Basically this program creates a positive integer multiplication function
(that is far slower than the built in multiplication function) and then
demonstrates this function with a use of the function. This program demonstrates the use of recursion, that is a form of iteration (repetition) in which there is a function that repeatedly calls itself until an exit condition is satisfied. It uses repeated additions to give the same result as mutiplication: e.g. 3&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;3 (addition) gives the same result as 3&amp;nbsp;*&amp;nbsp;2 (multiplication).

; ''Question:'' What is the first thing the program does?
: ''Answer:'' The first thing done is the function mult is defined with the lines:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def mult(a, b):
    if b == 0:
        return 0
    rest = mult(a, b - 1)
    value = a + rest
    return value
&lt;/source&gt;
: This creates a function that takes two parameters and returns a value when it is done.  Later this function can be run.
; What happens next?  
: The next line after the function, &lt;code&gt;print(&quot;3 * 2 = &quot;, mult(3, 2))&lt;/code&gt; is run.
; And what does this do?
: It prints &lt;code&gt;3 * 2 = &lt;/code&gt; and the return value of &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 2)&lt;/code&gt;
; And what does &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 2)&lt;/code&gt; return?
: We need to do a walkthrough of the &lt;code&gt;mult&lt;/code&gt; function to find out.
; What happens next?
: The variable &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; gets the value 3 assigned to it and the variable &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; gets the value 2 assigned to it.
; And then?
: The line &lt;code&gt;if b == 0:&lt;/code&gt; is run.  Since &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; has the value 2 this is false so the line &lt;code&gt;return 0&lt;/code&gt; is skipped.
; And what then?
: The line &lt;code&gt;rest = mult(a, b - 1)&lt;/code&gt; is run.  This line sets the local variable &lt;code&gt;rest&lt;/code&gt; to the value of &lt;code&gt;mult(a, b - 1)&lt;/code&gt;.  The value of &lt;code&gt; a&lt;/code&gt; is 3 and the value of &lt;code&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; is 2 so the function call is &lt;code&gt;mult(3,1)&lt;/code&gt;
; So what is the value of &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 1)&lt;/code&gt; ?
: We will need to run the function &lt;code&gt; mult&lt;/code&gt; with the parameters 3 and 1.
; So what happens next?
: The local variables in the '' new'' run of the function are set so that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; has the value 3 and &lt;code&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; has the value 1. Since these are local values these do not affect the previous values of &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;.
; And then?
: Since &lt;code&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; has the value 1 the if statement is false, so the next line becomes &lt;code&gt;rest = mult(a, b - 1)&lt;/code&gt;.
; What does this line do?
: This line will assign the value of &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 0)&lt;/code&gt; to rest.
; So what is that value?
: We will have to run the function one more time to find that out. This time &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; has the value 3 and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; has the value 0.
; So what happens next?
: The first line in the function to run is &lt;code&gt;if b == 0:&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt; b&lt;/code&gt; has the value 0 so the next line to run is &lt;code&gt;return 0&lt;/code&gt; 
; And what does the line &lt;code&gt;return 0&lt;/code&gt; do?
: This line returns the value 0 out of the function. 
; So?
: So now we know that &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 0)&lt;/code&gt; has the value 0.  Now we know what the line &lt;code&gt;rest = mult(a, b - 1)&lt;/code&gt; did since we have run the function &lt;code&gt;mult&lt;/code&gt; with the parameters 3 and 0.  We have finished running &lt;code&gt;mult(3, 0)&lt;/code&gt; and are now back to running &lt;code&gt; mult(3, 1)&lt;/code&gt;. The variable &lt;code&gt;rest&lt;/code&gt; gets assigned the value 0.
; What line is run next?
: The line &lt;code&gt;value = a + rest&lt;/code&gt; is run next. In this run of the function, &lt;code&gt;a = 3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rest = 0&lt;/code&gt; so now &lt;code&gt;value = 3&lt;/code&gt;.  
; What happens next?
: The line &lt;code&gt;return value&lt;/code&gt; is run.  This returns 3 from the function. This also exits from the run of the function &lt;code&gt; mult(3, 1)&lt;/code&gt;.  After &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; is called, we go back to running &lt;code&gt; mult(3, 2)&lt;/code&gt;.
; Where were we in &lt;code&gt; mult(3, 2)&lt;/code&gt;?
: We had the variables &lt;code&gt;a = 3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b = 2&lt;/code&gt; and were examining the line &lt;code&gt;rest = mult(a, b - 1)&lt;/code&gt;.
; So what happens now?
: The variable &lt;code&gt;rest&lt;/code&gt; get 3 assigned to it.  The next line &lt;code&gt;value = a + rest&lt;/code&gt; sets &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;3 + 3&lt;/code&gt; or 6.  
; So now what happens?
: The next line runs, this returns 6 from the function.  We are now back to running the line &lt;code&gt;print(&quot;3 * 2 = &quot;, mult(3, 2))&lt;/code&gt; which can now print out the 6.
; What is happening overall?  
: Basically we used two facts to calculate the multiple of the two numbers.  The first is that any number times 0 is 0 (&lt;code&gt;x * 0 = 0&lt;/code&gt;).  The second is that a number times another number is equal to the first number plus the first number times one less than the second number (&lt;code&gt;x * y = x + x * (y - 1)&lt;/code&gt;).  So what happens is &lt;code&gt;3 * 2&lt;/code&gt; is first converted into &lt;code&gt; 3 + 3 * 1&lt;/code&gt;.  Then &lt;code&gt;3 * 1&lt;/code&gt; is converted into &lt;code&gt;3 + 3 * 0&lt;/code&gt;.  Then we know that any number times 0 is 0 so &lt;code&gt;3 * 0&lt;/code&gt; is 0.  Then we can calculate that &lt;code&gt;3 + 3 * 0&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;3 + 0&lt;/code&gt; which is &lt;code&gt;3&lt;/code&gt;.  Now we know what &lt;code&gt;3 * 1&lt;/code&gt; is so we can calculate that &lt;code&gt;3 + 3 * 1&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;3 + 3&lt;/code&gt; which is &lt;code&gt;6&lt;/code&gt;.

This is how the whole thing works:

 3 * 2
 3 + 3 * 1
 3 + 3 + 3 * 0
 3 + 3 + 0
 3 + 3
 6

==== Recursion ====
Programming constructs solving a problem by solving a smaller version of the same problem are called ''recursive''. In the examples in this chapter, recursion is realized by defining a function calling itself. This facilitates implementing solutions to programming tasks as it may be sufficient to consider the next step of a problem instead of the whole problem at once. It is also useful as it allows to express some mathematical concepts with straightforward, easy to read code.

Any problem that can be solved with recursion could be re-implemented with loops. Using the latter usually results in better performance. However equivalent implementations using loops are usually harder to get done correctly.

Probably the most intuitive definition of ''recursion'' is:
; Recursion
: If you still don't get it, see ''recursion''.

Try walking through the factorial example if the multiplication example did not make sense.

=== Examples ===
'''factorial.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#defines a function that calculates the factorial

def factorial(n):
    if n &lt;= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(&quot;2! =&quot;, factorial(2))
print(&quot;3! =&quot;, factorial(3))
print(&quot;4! =&quot;, factorial(4))
print(&quot;5! =&quot;, factorial(5))
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:
 
 2! = 2
 3! = 6
 4! = 24
 5! = 120

'''countdown.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def count_down(n):
    print(n)
    if n &gt; 0:
        return count_down(n-1)

count_down(5)
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:
 5
 4
 3
 2
 1
 0

&lt;!--Now try replacing the &quot;if&quot; with &quot;while&quot; (you are still typing these out, right?).  Now you've managed to turn your computer into a calculator which can't correctly count down from four.  In essence, &quot;while&quot; acts as combined &quot;if&quot; and &quot;repeat.&quot;  Throwing in two recursions makes for some interesting counting.--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Variables with more than one value ===
You have already seen ordinary variables that store a single value.  However other variable types can hold more than one value.  These are called containers because they can contain more than one object.  The simplest type is called a list.  Here is an example of a list being used:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
which_one = int(input(&quot;What month (1-12)? &quot;))
months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July',
          'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']

if 1 &lt;= which_one &lt;= 12:
    print(&quot;The month is&quot;, months[which_one - 1])
&lt;/source&gt;

and an output example:

 What month (1-12)? '''3'''
 The month is March

In this example the &lt;code&gt;months&lt;/code&gt; is a list.  &lt;code&gt;months&lt;/code&gt; is defined with the lines &lt;code&gt; months = ['January', 'February', 'March', 'April', 'May', 'June', 'July',&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'August', 'September', 'October', 'November', 'December']&lt;/code&gt; (note that a &lt;code&gt;\&lt;/code&gt; could also be used to split a long line, but that is not necessary in this case because Python is intelligent enough to recognize that everything within brackets belongs together).  The &lt;code&gt;[&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; start and end the list with commas (&lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt;) separating the list items.  The list is used in &lt;code&gt;months[which_one - 1]&lt;/code&gt;.  A list consists of items that are numbered starting at 0.  In other words if you wanted January you would use &lt;code&gt;months[0]&lt;/code&gt;.  Give a list a number and it will return the value that is stored at that location.

The statement &lt;code&gt; if 1 &lt;= which_one &lt;= 12:&lt;/code&gt; will only be true if &lt;code&gt; which_one&lt;/code&gt; is between one and twelve inclusive (in other words it is what you would expect if you have seen that in algebra).

Lists can be thought of as a series of boxes. Each box has a different value. For example, the boxes created by  &lt;code&gt;demolist = ['life', 42, 'the universe', 6, 'and', 9]&lt;/code&gt; would look like this:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
!box number 
!0 
!1  
!2 
!3 
!4 
!5 
|-
|demolist 
|&quot;life&quot; 
|42 
|&quot;the universe&quot; 
|6 
|&quot;and&quot;
|9
|}

Each box is referenced by its number so the statement &lt;code&gt;demolist[0]&lt;/code&gt; would get &lt;code&gt;'life'&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;demolist[1]&lt;/code&gt; would get &lt;code&gt;42&lt;/code&gt; and so on up to &lt;code&gt;demolist[5]&lt;/code&gt; getting &lt;code&gt;9&lt;/code&gt;.

=== More features of lists ===
The next example is just to show a lot of other stuff lists can do (for once I don't expect you to type it in, but you should probably play around with lists in interactive mode until you are comfortable with them.).  Here goes:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
demolist = [&quot;life&quot;, 42, &quot;the universe&quot;, 6, &quot;and&quot;, 9]
print(&quot;demolist = &quot;,demolist)
demolist.append(&quot;everything&quot;)
print(&quot;after 'everything' was appended demolist is now:&quot;)
print(demolist)
print(&quot;len(demolist) =&quot;, len(demolist))
print(&quot;demolist.index(42) =&quot;, demolist.index(42))
print(&quot;demolist[1] =&quot;, demolist[1])

# Next we will loop through the list
for c in range(len(demolist)):
    print(&quot;demolist[&quot;, c, &quot;] =&quot;, demolist[c])

del demolist[2]
print(&quot;After 'the universe' was removed demolist is now:&quot;)
print(demolist)
if &quot;life&quot; in demolist:
    print(&quot;'life' was found in demolist&quot;)
else:
    print(&quot;'life' was not found in demolist&quot;)

if &quot;amoeba&quot; in demolist:
    print(&quot;'amoeba' was found in demolist&quot;)

if &quot;amoeba&quot; not in demolist:
    print(&quot;'amoeba' was not found in demolist&quot;)

another_list = [42,7,0,123]
another_list.sort()
print(&quot;The sorted another_list is&quot;, another_list)
&lt;/source&gt;

The output is:

 demolist =  ['life', 42, 'the universe', 6, 'and', 9]
 after 'everything' was appended demolist is now:
 ['life', 42, 'the universe', 6, 'and', 9, 'everything']
 len(demolist) = 7
 demolist.index(42) = 1
 demolist[1] = 42
 demolist[ 0 ] = life
 demolist[ 1 ] = 42
 demolist[ 2 ] = the universe
 demolist[ 3 ] = 6
 demolist[ 4 ] = and
 demolist[ 5 ] = 9
 demolist[ 6 ] = everything
 After 'the universe' was removed demolist is now:
 ['life', 42, 6, 'and', 9, 'everything']
 'life' was found in demolist
 'amoeba' was not found in demolist
 The sorted another_list is [0, 7, 42, 123]

This example uses a whole bunch of new functions.  Notice that you can
just &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; a whole list.  Next the &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt; function is used
to add a new item to the end of the list.  &lt;code&gt;len&lt;/code&gt; returns how many
items are in a list.  The valid indexes (as in numbers that can be
used inside of the &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;) of a list range from 0 to &lt;code&gt;len - 1&lt;/code&gt;. The
&lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; function tells where the first location of an item is
located in a list.  Notice how &lt;code&gt;demolist.index(42)&lt;/code&gt; returns 1, and
when &lt;code&gt;demolist[1]&lt;/code&gt; is run it returns 42.  To get help on all the functions a list provides for you, type &lt;code&gt;help(list)&lt;/code&gt; in the interactive Python interpreter.

The line &lt;code&gt;# Next we will loop through the list&lt;/code&gt; is a just a reminder to the programmer (also called a ''comment'').  Python ignores everything that is written after a &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; on the current line.  Next the lines:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for c in range(len(demolist)):
    print('demolist[', c, '] =', demolist[c])
&lt;/source&gt;

create a variable &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;, which starts at 0 and is incremented until it reaches the last index of the list.  Meanwhile the &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statement prints out each element of the list.

A much better way to do the above is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for c, x in enumerate(demolist):
    print(&quot;demolist[&quot;, c, &quot;] =&quot;, x)
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;del&lt;/code&gt; command can be used to remove a given element in a list.  The next few lines use the &lt;code&gt;in&lt;/code&gt; operator to test if an element is in or is not in a list. The &lt;code&gt;sort&lt;/code&gt; function sorts the list. This is useful if you need a
list in order from smallest number to largest or alphabetical.  Note
that this rearranges the list. In summary, for a list, the following operations occur:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!example 
!explanation
|-
|&lt;code&gt;demolist[2]&lt;/code&gt; 
|accesses the element at index 2
|-
|&lt;code&gt;demolist[2] = 3&lt;/code&gt; 
|sets the element at index 2 to be 3
|-
|&lt;code&gt;del demolist[2]&lt;/code&gt; 
|removes the element at index 2
|-
|&lt;code&gt;len(demolist)&lt;/code&gt; 
|returns the length of &lt;code&gt;demolist&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&quot;value&quot; in demolist&lt;/code&gt; 
|is ''True'' if &lt;tt&gt;&quot;value&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; is an element in &lt;code&gt;demolist&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&quot;value&quot; not in demolist&lt;/code&gt; 
|is ''True'' if &lt;code&gt;&quot;value&quot;&lt;/code&gt; is not an element in &lt;code&gt;demolist&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|&lt;code&gt;another_list.sort()&lt;/code&gt; 
|sorts &lt;code&gt;another_list&lt;/code&gt;.  Note that the list must be all numbers or all strings to be sorted.
|-
|&lt;code&gt;demolist.index(&quot;value&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; 
|returns the index of the first place that &lt;code&gt;&quot;value&quot;&lt;/code&gt; occurs
|-
|&lt;code&gt;demolist.append(&quot;value&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; 
|adds an element &lt;code&gt;&quot;value&quot;&lt;/code&gt; at the end of the list
|-
|&lt;code&gt;demolist.remove(&quot;value&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;
|removes the first occurrence of value from &lt;code&gt;demolist&lt;/code&gt; (same as &lt;code&gt;del demolist[demolist.index(&quot;value&quot;)]&lt;/code&gt;)
|}

This next example uses these features in a more useful way:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
menu_item = 0
namelist = []
while menu_item != 9:
    print(&quot;--------------------&quot;)
    print(&quot;1. Print the list&quot;)
    print(&quot;2. Add a name to the list&quot;)
    print(&quot;3. Remove a name from the list&quot;)
    print(&quot;4. Change an item in the list&quot;)
    print(&quot;9. Quit&quot;)
    menu_item = int(input(&quot;Pick an item from the menu: &quot;))
    if menu_item == 1:
        current = 0
        if len(namelist) &gt; 0:
            while current &lt; len(namelist):
                print(current, &quot;.&quot;, namelist[current])
                current = current + 1
        else:
            print(&quot;List is empty&quot;)
    elif menu_item == 2:
        name = input(&quot;Type in a name to add: &quot;)
        namelist.append(name)
    elif menu_item == 3:
        del_name = input(&quot;What name would you like to remove: &quot;)
        if del_name in namelist:
            # namelist.remove(del_name) would work just as fine
            item_number = namelist.index(del_name)
            del namelist[item_number]
            # The code above only removes the first occurrence of
            # the name.  The code below from Gerald removes all.
            # while del_name in namelist:
            #       item_number = namelist.index(del_name)
            #       del namelist[item_number]
        else:
            print(del_name, &quot;was not found&quot;)
    elif menu_item == 4:
        old_name = input(&quot;What name would you like to change: &quot;)
        if old_name in namelist:
            item_number = namelist.index(old_name)
            new_name = input(&quot;What is the new name: &quot;)
            namelist[item_number] = new_name
        else:
            print(old_name, &quot;was not found&quot;)

print(&quot;Goodbye&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is part of the output:

 --------------------
 1. Print the list
 2. Add a name to the list
 3. Remove a name from the list
 4. Change an item in the list
 9. Quit
 
 Pick an item from the menu: '''2'''
 Type in a name to add: '''Jack'''
 
 Pick an item from the menu: '''2'''
 Type in a name to add: '''Jill'''
 
 Pick an item from the menu: '''1'''
 0 . Jack
 1 . Jill
 
 Pick an item from the menu: '''3'''
 What name would you like to remove: '''Jack'''
 
 Pick an item from the menu: '''4'''
 What name would you like to change: '''Jill'''
 What is the new name: '''Jill Peters'''
 
 Pick an item from the menu: '''1'''
 0 . Jill Peters
 
 Pick an item from the menu: '''9'''
 Goodbye

That was a long program.  Let's take a look at the source code. The line &lt;code&gt;namelist = []&lt;/code&gt; makes the variable &lt;code&gt;namelist&lt;/code&gt; a list with no items (or elements).  The next important line is &lt;code&gt;while menu_item != 9:&lt;/code&gt;.  This line starts a loop that allows the menu system for this program.  The next few lines display a menu and decide which part of the program to run.

The section
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
current = 0
if len(namelist) &gt; 0:
    while current &lt; len(namelist):
        print(current, &quot;.&quot;, namelist[current])
        current = current + 1
else:
    print(&quot;List is empty&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
goes through the list and prints each name.  &lt;code&gt;len(namelist)&lt;/code&gt; tells how many items are in the list.  If &lt;code&gt;len&lt;/code&gt; returns &lt;code&gt;0&lt;/code&gt;, then the list is empty.

Then, a few lines later, the statement &lt;code&gt;namelist.append(name)&lt;/code&gt; appears.  It uses the &lt;code&gt;append&lt;/code&gt; function to add an item to the end of the list.  Jump down another two lines, and notice this section of code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
item_number = namelist.index(del_name)
del namelist[item_number]
&lt;/source&gt;
Here the &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; function is used to find the index value that will be used later to remove the item.  &lt;code&gt;del namelist[item_number]&lt;/code&gt; is used to remove a element of the list.   

The next section
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
old_name = input(&quot;What name would you like to change: &quot;)
if old_name in namelist:
    item_number = namelist.index(old_name)
    new_name = input(&quot;What is the new name: &quot;)
    namelist[item_number] = new_name
else:
   print(old_name, &quot;was not found&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
uses &lt;code&gt;index&lt;/code&gt; to find the &lt;code&gt;item_number&lt;/code&gt; and then puts &lt;code&gt;new_name&lt;/code&gt; where the &lt;code&gt;old_name&lt;/code&gt; was.

Congratulations, with lists under your belt, you now know enough of the language
that you could do any computations that a computer can do (this is technically known as [[Wikipedia:Turing_completeness|Turing-Completeness]]).  Of course, there are still many features that
are used to make your life easier.

=== Examples ===
'''test.py'''
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
## This program runs a test of knowledge

# First get the test questions
# Later this will be modified to use file io.
def get_questions():
    # notice how the data is stored as a list of lists
    return [[&quot;What color is the daytime sky on a clear day? &quot;, &quot;blue&quot;],
            [&quot;What is the answer to life, the universe and everything? &quot;, &quot;42&quot;],
            [&quot;What is a three letter word for mouse trap? &quot;, &quot;cat&quot;]]

# This will test a single question
# it takes a single question in
# it returns True if the user typed the correct answer, otherwise False

def check_question(question_and_answer):
    # extract the question and the answer from the list
    # This function takes a list with two elements, a question and an answer.  
    question = question_and_answer[0]   
    answer = question_and_answer[1]
    # give the question to the user
    given_answer = input(question)
    # compare the user's answer to the tester's answer
    if answer == given_answer:
        print(&quot;Correct&quot;)
        return True
    else:
        print(&quot;Incorrect, correct was:&quot;, answer)
        return False

# This will run through all the questions
def run_test(questions):
    if len(questions) == 0:
        print(&quot;No questions were given.&quot;)
        # the return exits the function
        return
    index = 0
    right = 0
    while index &lt; len(questions):
        # Check the question
        #Note that this is extracting a question and answer list from the list of lists.
        if check_question(questions[index]): 
            right = right + 1
        # go to the next question
        index = index + 1
    # notice the order of the computation, first multiply, then divide
    print(&quot;You got&quot;, right * 100 / len(questions),\
           &quot;% right out of&quot;, len(questions))

# now let's get the questions from the get_questions function, and
# send the returned list of lists as an argument to the run_test function.

run_test(get_questions())


&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The values &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; point to 1 and 0, respectively. They are often used in sanity checks, loop conditions etc. You will learn more about this a little bit later (chapter [[../Boolean Expressions|Boolean Expressions]]).
Please note that get_questions() is essentially a list because even though it's technically a function, returning a list of lists is the only thing it does. 

Sample Output:

 What color is the daytime sky on a clear day? '''green'''
 Incorrect, correct was: blue
 What is the answer to life, the universe and everything? '''42'''
 Correct
 What is a three letter word for mouse trap? '''cat'''
 Correct
 You got 66 % right out of 3

'''LinkbotMelody.py'''

We can also create our own lists of items and use for loops to loop through them. 
Lets try making a list of keyboard keys to play in order to play a simple tune.
We'll write this program using the knowledge that middle-C is the 40th key on our keyboard.
When you run this program, it should play the beginning of a very familiar tune. 
Can you guess what it is?

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo
dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect()
robot = dongle.getLinkbot('6wbn') # Replace '6wbn' with the serial ID on your Linkbot
import time     # Need to &quot;import time&quot; so we can use time.sleep()
myNotes = [44, 42, 40, 42, 44, 44, 44] # Put some notes into a list
t=0.5             # Set a value to be used for the duration of the note
for i in myNotes:         # Select which keys on a piano keyboard to use for the tones
    k=pow(2,(i-49)/12)*440      # Determines the frequency of the note to be played
    robot.setBuzzerFrequency(k) # Directs the Linkbot to play this frequency   
    time.sleep(t)               # Pauses the program while the note is played
    robot.setBuzzerFrequency(0) # Turns off the piezo speaker at the end of each note
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Exercises ===
Expand the test.py program so it has a menu giving the option of taking
the test, viewing the list of questions and answers, and an option to
quit.  Also, add a new question to ask, &quot;What noise does a truly

      <text xml:space="preserve">And here is the new typing exercise for this chapter:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
onetoten = range(1, 11)
for count in onetoten:
    print(count)
&lt;/source&gt;

and the ever-present output:

 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
 10

The output looks awfully familiar but the program code looks different.  The first line uses the &lt;code&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; function.  The &lt;code&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; function uses two arguments like this &lt;code&gt;range(start, finish)&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; is the first number that is produced.  &lt;code&gt;finish&lt;/code&gt; is one larger than the last number.  Note that this program could have been done in a shorter way:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for count in range(1, 11):
    print(count)
&lt;/source&gt;

The range function returns an iterable.  This can be converted into a list with the &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; function.  
Here are some examples to show what happens with the &lt;code&gt;range&lt;/code&gt; command:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''range(1, 10)'''
 range(1, 10)
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list(range(1, 10))'''
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list(range(-32, -20))'''
 [-32, -31, -30, -29, -28, -27, -26, -25, -24, -23, -22, -21]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list(range(5,21))'''
 [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list(range(5))'''
 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list(range(21, 5))'''
 []

The next line &lt;code&gt;for count in onetoten:&lt;/code&gt; uses the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; control structure.  A &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; control structure looks like &lt;code&gt;for variable in list:&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;list&lt;/code&gt; is gone through starting with the first element of the list and going to the last.  As &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; goes through each element in a list it puts each into &lt;code&gt;variable&lt;/code&gt;.  That allows &lt;code&gt;variable&lt;/code&gt; to be used in each successive time the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop is run through.  Here is another example (you don't have to type this) to demonstrate:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
demolist = ['life', 42, 'the universe', 6, 'and', 7, 'everything']
for item in demolist:
    print(&quot;The current item is:&quot;,item)
&lt;/source&gt;

The output is:

 The current item is: life
 The current item is: 42
 The current item is: the universe
 The current item is: 6
 The current item is: and
 The current item is: 7
 The current item is: everything

Notice how the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop goes through and sets item to each element in the list. So, what is &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; good for?  The first use is to go through all the elements of a list and do something with each of them.  Here's a quick way to add up all the elements:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list = [2, 4, 6, 8]
sum = 0
for num in list:
    sum = sum + num

print(&quot;The sum is:&quot;, sum)
&lt;/source&gt;

with the output simply being:

The sum is: 20

Or you could write a program to find out if there are any duplicates in a list like this program does:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 7, 10]
list.sort()
prev = None
for item in list:
    if prev == item:
        print(&quot;Duplicate of&quot;, prev, &quot;found&quot;)
    prev = item
&lt;/source&gt;

and for good measure:

 Duplicate of 7 found

Okay, so how does it work?  Here is a special debugging version to help you understand (you don't need to type this in):

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
l = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 7, 10]
print(&quot;l = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 7, 10]&quot;, &quot;\t\tl:&quot;, l)
l.sort()
print(&quot;l.sort()&quot;, &quot;\t\tl:&quot;, l)
prev = l[0]
print(&quot;prev = l[0]&quot;, &quot;\t\tprev:&quot;, prev)
del l[0]
print(&quot;del l[0]&quot;, &quot;\t\tl:&quot;, l)
for item in l:
    if prev == item:
        print(&quot;Duplicate of&quot;, prev, &quot;found&quot;)
    print(&quot;if prev == item:&quot;, &quot;\t\tprev:&quot;, prev, &quot;\titem:&quot;, item)
    prev = item
    print(&quot;prev = item&quot;, &quot;\t\tprev:&quot;, prev, &quot;\titem:&quot;, item)
&lt;/source&gt;

with the output being:

 l = [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 7, 10]        l: [4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 1, 0, 7, 10]
 l.sort()                l: [0, 1, 4, 5, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10]
 prev = l[0]             prev: 0
 del l[0]                l: [1, 4, 5, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10]
 if prev == item:        prev: 0         item: 1
 prev = item             prev: 1         item: 1
 if prev == item:        prev: 1         item: 4
 prev = item             prev: 4         item: 4
 if prev == item:        prev: 4         item: 5
 prev = item             prev: 5         item: 5
 if prev == item:        prev: 5         item: 7
 prev = item             prev: 7         item: 7
 Duplicate of 7 found
 if prev == item:        prev: 7         item: 7
 prev = item             prev: 7         item: 7
 if prev == item:        prev: 7         item: 8
 prev = item             prev: 8         item: 8
 if prev == item:        prev: 8         item: 9
 prev = item             prev: 9         item: 9
 if prev == item:        prev: 9         item: 10
 prev = item             prev: 10        item: 10

The reason I put so many &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statements in the code was so that you can see what is happening in each line.  (By the way, if you can't figure out why a program is not working, try putting in lots of print statements in places where you want to know what is happening.)  First the program starts with a boring old list.  Next the program sorts the list.  This is so that any duplicates get put next to each other.  The program then initializes a &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt;(ious) variable.  Next the first element of the list is deleted so that the first item is not incorrectly thought to be a duplicate.  Next a &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop is gone into.  Each item of the list is checked to see if it is the same as the previous.  If it is a duplicate was found.  The value of &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt; is then changed so that the next time the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop is run through &lt;code&gt;prev&lt;/code&gt; is the previous item to the current.  Sure enough, the 7 is found to be a duplicate.  (Notice how &lt;code&gt;\t&lt;/code&gt; is used to print a tab.)  

The other way to use &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops is to do something a certain number of times.  Here is some code to print out the first 9 numbers of the Fibonacci series:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 1
b = 1
for c in range(1, 10):
    print(a, end=&quot; &quot;)
    n = a + b
    a = b
    b = n
&lt;/source&gt;

with the surprising output:

 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34

Everything that can be done with &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops can also be done with &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops but &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops give an easy way to go through all the elements in a list or to do something a certain number of times.

=== A Linkbot Example ===
In this example the Linkbot will play changing tones a fixed number of times while the duration remains constant. The Linkbot can also change tone and duration a fixed number of times. Here we are using a for loop running with in a fixed range of values.

'''setBuzzerFrequency.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo
dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect()
robot = dongle.getLinkbot('6wbn') # Replace '6wbn' with the serial ID on your Linkbot
import time     # For time.sleep()
t=1             # Set a value to be used for the duration of the note
for i in range (33,43):         # Select which keys on a piano keyboard to use for the tones
    k=pow(2,(i-49)/12)*440      # Determines the frequency of the note to be played
    robot.setBuzzerFrequency(k) # Directs the Linkbot to play this frequency   
    time.sleep(t)               # Pauses the program while the note is played

robot.setBuzzerFrequency(0)     # Turns off the piezo speaker at the end of the program
&lt;/source&gt;

When you run this example play around with the loop range and time values to create interesting sounds.

      <comment>Added initial Linkbot Accelerometer example</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Here is a little example of boolean expressions (you don't have to type it in):
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 6
b = 7
c = 42
print(1, a == 6)
print(2, a == 7)
print(3, a == 6 and b == 7)
print(4, a == 7 and b == 7)
print(5, not a == 7 and b == 7)
print(6, a == 7 or b == 7)
print(7, a == 7 or b == 6)
print(8, not (a == 7 and b == 6))
print(9, not a == 7 and b == 6)
&lt;/source&gt;

With the output being:

 1 True
 2 False
 3 True
 4 False
 5 True
 6 True
 7 False
 8 True
 9 False

What is going on?  The program consists of a bunch of funny looking &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statements.  Each &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; statement prints a number and an expression.  The number is to help keep track of which statement I am dealing with.  Notice how each expression ends up being either &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt;.  In Python false can also be written as 0 and true as 1.  
&lt;!-- For example: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;&gt;&gt; if 1: --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...     print &quot;true&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- ... else: --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...     print &quot;false&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...  --&gt;
&lt;!-- true --&gt;
&lt;!-- &gt;&gt;&gt; if 0: --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...     print &quot;true&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- ... else: --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...     print &quot;false&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!-- ...  --&gt;
&lt;!-- false --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;

The lines:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(1, a == 6)
print(2, a == 7)
&lt;/source&gt;

print out a &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; and a &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; respectively just as expected since the first is true and the second is false.  The third print, &lt;code&gt;print(3, a == 6 and b == 7)&lt;/code&gt;, is a little different.  The operator &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; means if both the statement before and the statement after are true then the whole expression is true otherwise the whole expression is false.  The next line, &lt;code&gt;print(4, a == 7 and b == 7)&lt;/code&gt;, shows how if part of an &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; expression is false, the whole thing is false.  The behavior of &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; can be summarized as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!expression 
!result 
|-  
|true &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; true 
|true 
|-
|true &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; false 
|false 
|-
|false &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; true 
|false
|-
|false &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; false 
|false
|}

Notice that if the first expression is false Python does not check the second expression since it knows the whole expression is false.  Try running &lt;code&gt;False and print(&quot;Hi&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; and compare this to running &lt;code&gt;True and print(&quot;Hi&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;  The technical term for this is [[w:Short-circuit evaluation|short-circuit evaluation]]  

The next line, &lt;code&gt;print(5, not a == 7 and b == 7)&lt;/code&gt;, uses the &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; operator.  &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; just gives the opposite of the expression. (The expression could be rewritten as &lt;code&gt; print(5, a != 7 and b == 7)&lt;/code&gt;).  Here is the table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!expression 
!result
|-
|&lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; true 
|false 
|-
|&lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; false 
|true
|}

The two following lines, &lt;code&gt;print(6, a == 7 or b == 7)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;print(7, a == 7 or b == 6)&lt;/code&gt;, use the &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; operator.  The &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; operator returns true if the first expression is true, or if the second expression is true or both are true.  If neither are true it returns false.  Here's the table:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!expression 
!result
|-  
|true &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; true 
| true
|-
|true &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; false 
|true
|-
|false &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; true 
| true  
|-
|false &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; false 
| false 
|}

Notice that if the first expression is true Python doesn't check the second expression since it knows the whole expression is true.  This works since &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; is true if at least one half of the expression is true.  The first part is true so the second part could be either false or true, but the whole expression is still true.

The next two lines, &lt;code&gt;print(8, not (a == 7 and b == 6))&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;print(9, not a == 7 and b == 6)&lt;/code&gt;, show that parentheses can be used to group expressions and force one part to be evaluated first.  Notice that the parentheses changed the expression from false to true. This occurred since the parentheses forced the &lt;code&gt;not&lt;/code&gt; to apply to the whole expression instead of just the &lt;code&gt;a == 7&lt;/code&gt; portion.

Here is an example of using a boolean expression:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
list = [&quot;Life&quot;, &quot;The Universe&quot;, &quot;Everything&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Jill&quot;, &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Jill&quot;]

# make a copy of the list. See the More on Lists chapter to explain what [:] means.
copy = list[:]
# sort the copy
copy.sort()
prev = copy[0]
del copy[0]

count = 0

# go through the list searching for a match
while count &lt; len(copy) and copy[count] != prev:
    prev = copy[count]
    count = count + 1

# If a match was not found then count can't be &lt; len
# since the while loop continues while count is &lt; len
# and no match is found

if count &lt; len(copy):
    print(&quot;First Match:&quot;, prev)
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is the output:

 First Match: Jill

This program works by continuing to check for match &lt;code&gt;while count &lt; len(copy) and copy[count] is not equal to prev&lt;/code&gt;.  When either &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; is greater than the last index of &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt; or a match has been found the &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; is no longer true so the loop exits.  The &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; simply checks to make sure that the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; exited because a match was found.  

The other &quot;trick&quot; of &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; is used in this example.  If you look at the table for &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; notice that the third entry is &quot;false and false&quot;.   If &lt;code&gt;count &gt;= len(copy)&lt;/code&gt; (in other words &lt;code&gt;count &lt; len(copy)&lt;/code&gt; is false) then &lt;code&gt;copy[count]&lt;/code&gt; is never looked at.  This is because Python knows that if the first is false then they can't both be true.  This is known as a short circuit and is useful if the second half of the &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; will cause an error if something is wrong.  I used the first expression (&lt;code&gt;count &lt; len(copy)&lt;/code&gt;) to check and see if &lt;code&gt;count&lt;/code&gt; was a valid index for &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt;.  (If you don't believe me remove the matches &quot;Jill&quot; and &quot;Life&quot;, check that it still works and then reverse the order of &lt;code&gt;count &lt; len(copy) and copy[count] != prev&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;copy[count] != prev and count &lt; len(copy)&lt;/code&gt;.)

Boolean expressions can be used when you need to check two or more different things at once.

=== A note on Boolean Operators ===
A common mistake for people new to programming is a misunderstanding of the way that boolean operators works, which stems from the way the python interpreter reads these expressions.  For example, after initially learning about &quot;and &quot; and &quot;or&quot; statements, one might assume that the expression &lt;code&gt;x == ('a' or 'b')&lt;/code&gt; would check to see if the variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; was equivalent to one of the strings &lt;code&gt;'a'&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'b'&lt;/code&gt;.  This is not so.  To see what I'm talking about, start an interactive session with the interpreter and enter the following expressions:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; 'a' == ('a' or 'b')
 &gt;&gt;&gt; 'b' == ('a' or 'b')
 &gt;&gt;&gt; 'a' == ('a' and 'b')
 &gt;&gt;&gt; 'b' == ('a' and 'b')

And this will be the unintuitive result:

 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'a' == ('a' or 'b')'''
 True
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'b' == ('a' or 'b')'''
 False
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'a' == ('a' and 'b')'''
 False 
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'b' == ('a' and 'b')'''
 True

At this point, the &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; operators seem to be broken.  It doesn't make sense that, for the first two expressions, &lt;code&gt;'a'&lt;/code&gt; is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;'a'&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'b'&lt;/code&gt; while &lt;code&gt;'b'&lt;/code&gt; is not.  Furthermore, it doesn't make any sense that 'b' is equivalent to &lt;code&gt;'a'&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;'b'&lt;/code&gt;.  After examining what the interpreter does with boolean operators, these results do in fact exactly what you are asking of them, it's just not the same as what you think you are asking.

When the Python interpreter looks at an &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; expression, it takes the first statement and checks to see if it is true. If the first statement is true, then Python returns that object's value without checking the second statement.  This is because for an &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; expression, the whole thing is true if one of the values is true; the program does not need to bother with the second statement. On the other hand, if the first value is evaluated as false Python checks the second half and returns that value. That second half determines the truth value of the whole expression since the first half was false.  This &quot;laziness&quot; on the part of the interpreter is called &quot;short circuiting&quot; and is a common way of evaluating boolean expressions in many programming languages.

Similarly, for an &lt;code&gt;and&lt;/code&gt; expression, Python uses a short circuit technique to speed truth value evaluation.  If the first statement is false then the whole thing must be false, so it returns that value.  Otherwise if the first value is true it checks the second and returns that value.

One thing to note at this point is that the boolean expression returns a value indicating &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt;, but that Python considers a number of different things to have a truth value assigned to them.  To check the truth value of any given object &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;, you can use the fuction &lt;code&gt;bool(x)&lt;/code&gt; to see its truth value.  Below is a table with examples of the truth values of various objects:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!True !!False
|-
|True ||False
|-
|1 ||0
|-
|Numbers other than zero ||The string 'None'
|-
|Nonempty strings ||Empty strings
|-
|Nonempty lists ||Empty lists 
|-
|Nonempty dictionaries ||Empty dictionaries
|}

Now it is possible to understand the perplexing results we were getting when we tested those boolean expressions before.  Let's take a look at what the interpreter &quot;sees&quot; as it goes through that code:

'''First case:'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'a' == ('a' or 'b')'''  # Look at parentheses first, so evaluate expression &quot;('a' or 'b')&quot;
                            # 'a' is a nonempty string, so the first value is True
                            # Return that first value: 'a'
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'a' == 'a' '''          # the string 'a' is equivalent to the string 'a', so expression is True
 True

'''Second case:'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'b' == ('a' or 'b')'''  # Look at parentheses first, so evaluate expression &quot;('a' or 'b')&quot;
                            # 'a' is a nonempty string, so the first value is True
                            # Return that first value: 'a'
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'b' == 'a' '''          # the string 'b' is not equivalent to the string 'a', so expression is False
 False 

'''Third case:'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'a' == ('a' and 'b')''' # Look at parentheses first, so evaluate expression &quot;('a' and 'b')&quot;
                            # 'a' is a nonempty string, so the first value is True, examine second value
                            # 'b' is a nonempty string, so second value is True
                            # Return that second value as result of whole expression: 'b'
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'a' == 'b' '''          # the string 'a' is not equivalent to the string 'b', so expression is False
 False

'''Fourth case:'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'b' == ('a' and 'b')''' # Look at parentheses first, so evaluate expression &quot;('a' and 'b')&quot;
                            # 'a' is a nonempty string, so the first value is True, examine second value
                            # 'b' is a nonempty string, so second value is True
                            # Return that second value as result of whole expression: 'b'
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'b' == 'b' '''          # the string 'b' is equivalent to the string 'b', so expression is True
 True 

So Python was really doing its job when it gave those apparently bogus results.  As mentioned previously, the important thing is to recognize what value your boolean expression will return when it is evaluated, because it isn't always obvious.  

Going back to those initial expressions, this is how you would write them out so they behaved in a way that you want:

 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'a' == 'a' or 'a' == 'b' '''
 True
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'b' == 'a' or 'b' == 'b' '''
 True
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'a' == 'a' and 'a' == 'b' '''
 False
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''' 'b' == 'a' and 'b' == 'b' '''
 False

When these comparisons are evaluated they return truth values in terms of True or False, not strings, so we get the proper results.

=== Using the Linkbot's Accelerometer ===
An accelerometer is a device which can be used to detect the acceleration of an object, or the force of gravity. For instance, when you are sitting in a car and the driver steps on the gas pedal, you can feel a force pushing you back into your seat. Or, as you are sitting in your chair right now, you can feel Earth's gravity pulling you down, towards the center of the earth. The Linkbot can also feel these forces acting on it using its accelerometer, and you can get the accelerometer values from the Linkbot.

Lets take a look at the Linkbot's &lt;code&gt;getAccelerometerData()&lt;/code&gt; function. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo
dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect()
myLinkbot = dongle.getLinkbot()

accel = myLinkbot.getAccelerometerData()
print(accel)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Output&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[0.005859375, -0.1005859375, 0.9755859375]
&lt;/pre&gt;

This small program connects to a Linkbot, gets its accelerometer data, and prints it out. The number you get may be different than the ones shown, depending on the orientation and acceleration of your Linkbot when you ran the program. 

Notice that the value isn't a single value, but is actually a list of 3 values. Each one of these values is the force (in G's) that the Linkbot is currently experiencing on a particular axis direction, corresponding to the x, y, and z axes of the Linkbot. 

We can calculate the total magnitude of force that the Linkbot is experiencing through this equation:

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{TotalMagnitude} = \sqrt{ x^2 + y^2 + z^2 }
&lt;/math&gt;

Lets write a Python function that calculates the magnitude of acceleration given a list of three acceleration values:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import math  # for math.sqrt(), the square-root function

def accelMag(accel):
    return math.sqrt( accel[0]**2 + accel[1]**2 + accel[2]**2 )

import barobo
dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect()
myLinkbot = dongle.getLinkbot('ABCD')  # Replace 'ABCD' with your Linkbot's Serial ID

accel = myLinkbot.getAccelerometerData()  # Get the accel values
print(accel)            # print accel values
print(accelMag(accel))  # print total magnitude of accel values
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Output:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[0.0078125, -0.1015625, 0.974609375]
0.9799180631054775
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that the units of these numbers is in earth-gravitational units, usually called &quot;G's&quot;. When the above output was produced, the code was executed on a Linkbot that was sitting still on a desk. Because the Linkbot is only being pulled on by Earth's gravity, we expect its magnitude to be very close to 1. If the Linkbot were weightless, floating in space, or in freefall, we can expect the magnitude to be close to zero. 

Lets try tilting our Linkbot on a diagonal and running it again. We should expect the three numbers in the list to change, but the total magnitude should still be very close to 1.

&lt;b&gt;Output:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
[0.72265625, -0.6875, -0.0244140625]
0.997739621400201
&lt;/pre&gt;

As we can see, the &lt;code&gt;accelMag()&lt;/code&gt; function that we wrote can display the total magnitude of acceleration acting on the Linkbot regardless of direction. That means we can use it to detect free-fall or high acceleration events, like if the Linkbot is dropped, or bumps into something.

Now, lets try to write a program that makes the Linkbot beep if it detects that it is in freefall.
Notice, though, that the values reported by the accelerometer have some &quot;noise&quot;. Noise is tiny amounts of error that are picked up at random by robotic sensors. What this means is that the magnitude reported by the Linkbot will almost never exactly zero or exactly 1, even if the Linkbot is in free-fall or sitting still on your desk. What this means is when we write our program, we don't want to check to see if the acceleration magnitude is zero. Instead, we want to check to see if it is below a certain threshold; say, 0.2 G's.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import math  # for math.sqrt()                                                                      
                                                                                 
def accelMag(accel):                                                             
    return math.sqrt( accel[0]**2 + accel[1]**2 + accel[2]**2 )                  
                                                                                 
import barobo                                                                    
import time  # for time.sleep()                                                                      
dongle = barobo.Dongle()                                                         
dongle.connect()                                                                 
myLinkbot = dongle.getLinkbot('ABCD')  # Replace 'ABCD' with your Linkbot's Serial ID                                                 
                                                                                 
print('Gently toss your Linkbot into the air. Type Ctrl-C to quit the program.') 
                                                                                 
while True:                                                                      
    accel = myLinkbot.getAccelerometerData()                                     
    if accelMag(accel) &lt; 0.2:                 # 1                                    
        myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(440)     # 2                                   
        print('Wheeee!')                                                         
        time.sleep(1)                                                            
        myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(0)
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that we've now added an infinite loop to the program. The loop repeatedly checks the accelerometer magnitude at &quot;# 1&quot;. If the magnitude is less than 0.2, it beeps the buzzer for 1 second at &quot;# 2&quot;. 

=== Examples ===
'''password1.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
## This program asks a user for a name and a password.
# It then checks them to make sure that the user is allowed in.

name = input(&quot;What is your name? &quot;)
password = input(&quot;What is the password? &quot;)
if name == &quot;Josh&quot; and password == &quot;Friday&quot;:
    print(&quot;Welcome Josh&quot;)
elif name == &quot;Fred&quot; and password == &quot;Rock&quot;:
    print(&quot;Welcome Fred&quot;)
else:
    print(&quot;I don't know you.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample runs

 What is your name? '''Josh'''
 What is the password? '''Friday'''
 Welcome Josh

 What is your name? '''Bill'''
 What is the password? '''Money'''
 I don't know you.

=== Exercises ===
Write a program that has a user guess your name, but they only get 3 chances to do so until the program quits.

{{Solution|title=Solution|text=
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Try to guess my name!&quot;)
count = 1
name = &quot;guilherme&quot;
guess = input(&quot;What is my name? &quot;)
while count &lt; 3 and guess.lower() != name:    # .lower allows things like Guilherme to still match
    print(&quot;You are wrong!&quot;)
    guess = input(&quot;What is my name? &quot;)
    count = count + 1

if guess.lower() != name:
    print(&quot;You are wrong!&quot;) # this message isn't printed in the third chance, so we print it now
    print(&quot;You ran out of chances.&quot;)
else:
    print(&quot;Yes! My name is&quot;, name + &quot;!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

}}

Write a Linkbot program that beeps if the acceleration exceeds 2 G's. This typically happens if the robot is bumped, or when the robot is shaken vigorously.

        name = input(&quot;Name: &quot;)
        phone = input(&quot;Number: &quot;)
        numbers[name] = phone
    elif menu_choice == 3:
        print(&quot;Remove Name and Number&quot;)
        name = input(&quot;Name: &quot;)
        if name in numbers:
            del numbers[name]
        else:
            print(name, &quot;was not found&quot;)
    elif menu_choice == 4:
        print(&quot;Lookup Number&quot;)

This program is similar to the name list earlier in the chapter on lists.  Here's how the program works.  First the function &lt;code&gt;print_menu&lt;/code&gt; is defined.  &lt;code&gt;print_menu&lt;/code&gt; just prints a menu that is later used twice in the program.  Next comes the funny looking line &lt;code&gt;numbers = {}&lt;/code&gt;.  All that this line does is to tell Python that &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt; is a dictionary.  The next few lines just make the menu work.  The lines
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
for x in numbers.keys():
    print &quot;Name:&quot;, x, &quot;\tNumber:&quot;, numbers[x]
&lt;/source&gt;
go through the dictionary and print all the information.  The function &lt;code&gt; numbers.keys()&lt;/code&gt; returns a list that is then used by the &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loop.  The list returned by &lt;code&gt;keys()&lt;/code&gt; is not in any particular order so if you want it in alphabetic order it must be sorted.  Similar to lists the statement &lt;code&gt;numbers[x]&lt;/code&gt; is used to access a specific member of the dictionary.  Of course in this case &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; is a string.  Next the line &lt;code&gt;numbers[name] = phone&lt;/code&gt; adds a name and phone number to the dictionary.  If &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; had already been in the dictionary &lt;code&gt;phone&lt;/code&gt; would replace whatever was there before.  Next the lines
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if name in numbers:
    del numbers[name]
&lt;/source&gt;
see if a name is in the dictionary and remove it if it is.  The operator &lt;code&gt;name in numbers&lt;/code&gt; returns true if &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; is in &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt; but otherwise returns false.  The line &lt;code&gt;del numbers[name]&lt;/code&gt; removes the key &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; and the value associated with that key.  The lines
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
if name in numbers:
    print(&quot;The number is&quot;, numbers[name])
&lt;/source&gt;
check to see if the dictionary has a certain key and if it does prints out the number associated with it.  Lastly if the menu choice is invalid it reprints the menu for your viewing pleasure.

A recap: Dictionaries have keys and values.  Keys can be strings or
numbers.  Keys point to values.  Values can be any type of variable
(including lists or even dictionaries (those dictionaries or lists of
course can contain dictionaries or lists themselves (scary right? :-)
))).  Here is an example of using a list in a dictionary:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
max_points = [25, 25, 50, 25, 100]
assignments = ['hw ch 1', 'hw ch 2', 'quiz   ', 'hw ch 3', 'test']
students = {'#Max': max_points}

def print_menu():
    print(&quot;1. Add student&quot;)
    print(&quot;2. Remove student&quot;)
    print(&quot;3. Print grades&quot;)
    print(&quot;4. Record grade&quot;)
    print(&quot;5. Print Menu&quot;)
    print(&quot;6. Exit&quot;)

def print_all_grades():
    print('\t', end=' ')
    for i in range(len(assignments)):
        print(assignments[i], '\t', end=' ')
    print()
    keys = list(students.keys())
    keys.sort()
    for x in keys:
        print(x, '\t', end=' ')
        grades = students[x]
        print_grades(grades)

def print_grades(grades):
    for i in range(len(grades)):
        print(grades[i], '\t', end=' ')
    print()

print_menu()
menu_choice = 0
while menu_choice != 6:
    print()
    menu_choice = int(input(&quot;Menu Choice (1-6): &quot;))
    if menu_choice == 1:
        name = input(&quot;Student to add: &quot;)
        students[name] = [0] * len(max_points)
    elif menu_choice == 2:
        name = input(&quot;Student to remove: &quot;)
        if name in students:
            del students[name]
        else:
            print(&quot;Student:&quot;, name, &quot;not found&quot;)
    elif menu_choice == 3:
        print_all_grades()
    elif menu_choice == 4:
        print(&quot;Record Grade&quot;)
        name = input(&quot;Student: &quot;)
        if name in students:
            grades = students[name]
            print(&quot;Type in the number of the grade to record&quot;)
            print(&quot;Type a 0 (zero) to exit&quot;)
            for i in range(len(assignments)):
                print(i + 1, assignments[i], '\t', end=' ')
            print()
            print_grades(grades)
            which = 1234
            while which != -1:
                which = int(input(&quot;Change which Grade: &quot;))
                which -= 1    #same as which = which - 1
                if 0 &lt;= which &lt; len(grades):
                    grade = int(input(&quot;Grade: &quot;))
                    grades[which] = grade
                elif which != -1:
                    print(&quot;Invalid Grade Number&quot;)
        else:
            print(&quot;Student not found&quot;)
    elif menu_choice != 6:
        print_menu()
&lt;/source&gt;

Heres how the program works.  Basically the variable &lt;code&gt;students&lt;/code&gt; is a dictionary with the keys being the name of the students and the values being their grades.  The first two lines just create two lists.
The next line &lt;code&gt;students = {'#Max': max_points}&lt;/code&gt; creates a new
dictionary with the key {&lt;code&gt;#Max&lt;/code&gt;} and the value is set to be &lt;code&gt;[25, 25, 50, 25, 100]&lt;/code&gt; (since thats what &lt;code&gt;max_points&lt;/code&gt; was when the assignment is made) (I use the key &lt;code&gt;#Max&lt;/code&gt; since &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; is sorted ahead of any alphabetic characters).  Next &lt;code&gt;print_menu&lt;/code&gt; is defined.  Next the &lt;code&gt;print_all_grades&lt;/code&gt; function is defined in the
lines:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def print_all_grades():
    print('\t',end=&quot; &quot;)
    for i in range(len(assignments)):
        print(assignments[i], '\t',end=&quot; &quot;)
    print()
    keys = list(students.keys())
    keys.sort()
    for x in keys:
        print(x, '\t',end=' ')
        grades = students[x]
        print_grades(grades)
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice how first the keys are gotten out of the &lt;code&gt;students&lt;/code&gt; dictionary with the &lt;code&gt;keys&lt;/code&gt; function in the line &lt;code&gt;keys = list(students.keys())&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;keys&lt;/code&gt; is a iterable, and it is converted to list so all the functions for lists can be used on it.  Next the keys are sorted in the line &lt;code&gt;keys.sort()&lt;/code&gt;.  &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; is used to go through all the keys. The grades are stored as a list inside the dictionary so the assignment &lt;code&gt;grades = students[x]&lt;/code&gt; gives &lt;code&gt;grades&lt;/code&gt; the list that is stored at the key &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;.  The function &lt;code&gt;print_grades&lt;/code&gt; just prints a list and is defined a few lines later.

The later lines of the program implement the various options of the menu.  The line &lt;code&gt;students[name] = [0] * len(max_points)&lt;/code&gt; adds a student to the key of their name.  The notation &lt;code&gt;[0] * len(max_points)&lt;/code&gt; just creates a list of 0's that is the same length as the &lt;code&gt;max_points&lt;/code&gt; list.  

The remove student entry just deletes a student similar to the telephone book example.  The record grades choice is a little more complex.  The grades are retrieved in the line &lt;code&gt;grades = students[name]&lt;/code&gt; gets a reference to the grades of the student &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;.  A grade is then recorded in the line &lt;code&gt;grades[which] = grade&lt;/code&gt;.  You may notice that &lt;code&gt;grades&lt;/code&gt; is never put back into the students dictionary (as in no &lt;code&gt;students[name] = grades&lt;/code&gt;).  The reason for the missing statement is that &lt;code&gt;grades&lt;/code&gt; is actually another name for &lt;code&gt;students[name]&lt;/code&gt; and so changing &lt;code&gt;grades&lt;/code&gt; changes &lt;code&gt;student[name]&lt;/code&gt;.  

Dictionaries provide a easy way to link keys to values.  This can be used to easily keep track of data that is attached to various keys.

== Using a Dictionary to Store Musical Notes ==

Up to this point, our Linkbot programs have been playing musical notes on the Linkbot either by specifying a specific frequency to play, such as &lt;code&gt; myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(440) &lt;/code&gt;, or using an equation to calculate the frequency based on a keyboard key number. Wouldn't it be nice if we could just tell the Linkbot to play notes like &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot;, or &quot;A-B-C&quot;? 

Perhaps we can use a dictionary to accomplish this task. We can use a dictionary that uses the strings &quot;Do&quot;, &quot;Re&quot;, &quot;Mi&quot;, etc. as keys, and their actual frequencies as values. To find the actual values, we can use an equation or simply look them up online. A quick search shows these frequencies:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Note Name !! Note Frequency
|-
| Do || 261.63
|-
| Re || 293.66
|-
| Mi || 329.63
|-
| Fa || 349.23
|-
| Sol || 392.00
|-
| La || 440
|-
| Ti || 493.88
|}

Now we can create and use a dictionary to play notes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;

              'Ti' : 493.88 }

    playNote(myLinkbot, note)
&lt;/source&gt;

# Here, we define a helper function that helps us play notes. The function takes a linkbot object and a string note value such as &quot;Do&quot; as input arguments and plays that note on the linkbot for 0.5 seconds.
# This is where we create the dictionary that relates note names to note frequencies.
# This list defines the notes in a simple song we want to play.
# This loop takes each note in the list of notes that we constructed earlier and plays it using our &lt;code&gt;playNote()&lt;/code&gt; function.

(I skipped some of the output, but I think you get the idea.) So what does the program do?  The first line &lt;code&gt;import calendar&lt;/code&gt; uses a new command &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt;.  The command &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; loads a module (in this case the &lt;code&gt;calendar&lt;/code&gt; module).  To see the commands available in the standard modules either look in the library reference for python (if you downloaded it) or go to http://docs.python.org/library/.  If you look at the documentation for the calendar module, it lists a function called &lt;code&gt;prcal&lt;/code&gt; that prints a calendar for a year.  The line &lt;code&gt;calendar.prcal(year)&lt;/code&gt; uses this function.  In summary to use a module &lt;code&gt;import&lt;/code&gt; it and then use &lt;code&gt;module_name.function&lt;code&gt; for functions in the module.  Another way to write the program is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from calendar import prcal

year = int(input(&quot;Type in the year number: &quot;))
prcal(year)
&lt;/source&gt; 

This version imports a specific function from a module.  Here is another program that uses the Python Library (name it something like clock.py) (press Ctrl and the 'c' key at the same time to terminate the program):

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from time import time, ctime

prev_time = &quot;&quot;
while True:
    the_time = ctime(time())
    if prev_time != the_time:
        print(&quot;The time is:&quot;, ctime(time()))
        prev_time = the_time
&lt;/source&gt;

With some output being:

 The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:04 2000
 The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:05 2000
 The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:06 2000
 The time is: Sun Aug 20 13:40:07 2000
 
 Traceback (innermost last):
  File &quot;clock.py&quot;, line 5, in ?
     the_time = ctime(time())
 
 KeyboardInterrupt

The output is infinite of course so I canceled it (or the output at least continues until Ctrl+C is pressed).  The program just does a infinite loop (&lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; is always true, so &lt;code&gt;while True:&lt;/code&gt; goes forever) and each time checks to see if the time has changed and prints it if it has.  Notice how multiple names after the import statement are used in the line &lt;code&gt;from time import time, ctime&lt;/code&gt;.  

The Python Library contains many useful functions.  These functions give your programs more abilities and many of them can simplify programming in Python.

The following Barobo Linkbot program demonstrates multiple modules that are used to create some fun examples of playing with the Linkbot functionality. Comments have been added to the program to explain what the link is doing as you read. Once again the &lt;code&gt;while True:&lt;/code&gt; puts the program in an infinite loop that can be exited when Ctrl+C is pressed.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo   #imports the module with the Linkbot commands
import time     #imports the module to use time.sleep
import random   #imports a random integer generator

dongle = barobo.Dongle()     #this block uses the 'barobo' module to connect the Linkbot
dongle.connect()             #and the dongle that is plugged into the computer
robotID = input('Enter robot ID: ') #prompts user to enter Linkbot ID
robot = dongle.getLinkbot(robotID) 

def callback(mask, buttons, data):
    if buttons &amp; 0x02:
        robot.setLEDColor(           #calls setLEDColor from 'barobo' module
            random.randint(0, 255),  #uses the 'random' integer generator from
            random.randint(0, 255),  #the random module to set colors
            random.randint(0, 255)
            )
        
robot.enableButtonCallback(callback)
while True:
    time.sleep(1)   #uses the 'time' module to call time.sleep command
&lt;/source&gt;

Check out the range of colors and intensity the Linkbot is capable of generating with its built in RGB LED.

      <text xml:space="preserve">We have already seen lists and how they can be used.   Now that you have some more background I will go into more detail about lists.  First we will look at more ways to get at the elements in a list and then we will talk about copying them.  

Here are some examples of using indexing to access a single element of a list:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers = ['zero', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five']'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[0]'''
 'zero'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[4]'''
 'four'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[5]'''
 'five'

All those examples should look familiar to you.  If you want the first item in the list just look at index 0.  The second item is index 1 and so on through the list.  However what if you want the last item in the list?  One way could be to use the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function like &lt;code&gt;some_numbers[len(some_numbers) - 1]&lt;/code&gt;.  This way works since the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function always returns the last index plus one.  The second from the last would then be &lt;code&gt;some_numbers[len(some_numbers) - 2]&lt;/code&gt;.  There is an easier way to do this.  In Python the last item is always index -1.  The second to the last is index -2 and so on.  Here are some more examples:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[len(some_numbers) - 1]'''
 'five'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[len(some_numbers) - 2]'''
 'four'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[-1]'''
 'five'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[-2]'''
 'four'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''some_numbers[-6]'''
 'zero'

Thus any item in the list can be indexed in two ways: from the front and from the back.

Another useful way to get into parts of lists is using slicing.  Here is another example to give you an idea what they can be used for:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things = [0, 'Fred', 2, 'S.P.A.M.', 'Stocking', 42, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;Jill&quot;]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[0]'''
 0
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[7]'''
 'Jill'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[0:8]'''
 [0, 'Fred', 2, 'S.P.A.M.', 'Stocking', 42, 'Jack', 'Jill']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[2:4]'''
 [2, 'S.P.A.M.']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[4:7]'''
 ['Stocking', 42, 'Jack']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[1:5]'''
 ['Fred', 2, 'S.P.A.M.', 'Stocking']

Slicing is used to return part of a list.  The slicing operator is in the form &lt;code&gt;things[first_index:last_index]&lt;/code&gt;.  Slicing cuts the list before the &lt;code&gt;first_index&lt;/code&gt; and before the &lt;code&gt;last_index&lt;/code&gt; and returns the parts in between.  You can use both types of indexing:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[-4:-2]'''
 ['Stocking', 42]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[-4]'''
 'Stocking'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[-4:6]'''
 ['Stocking', 42]

Another trick with slicing is the unspecified index.  If the first index is not specified the beginning of the list is assumed.  If the last index is not specified the whole rest of the list is assumed.  Here are some examples:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[:2]'''
 [0, 'Fred']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[-2:]'''
 ['Jack', 'Jill']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[:3]'''
 [0, 'Fred', 2]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''things[:-5]'''
 [0, 'Fred', 2]

Here is a (HTML inspired) program example (copy and paste in the poem definition if you want):
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
poem = [&quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;Jill&quot;, &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;, &quot;went&quot;, &quot;up&quot;, &quot;the&quot;,
        &quot;hill&quot;, &quot;to&quot;, &quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;, &quot;fetch&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;pail&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;,
        &quot;water.&quot;, &quot;Jack&quot;, &quot;fell&quot;, &quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;broke&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;, &quot;his&quot;, &quot;crown&quot;, &quot;and&quot;, &quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;, &quot;Jill&quot;, &quot;came&quot;,
        &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;, &quot;tumbling&quot;, &quot;after&quot;]

def get_bolds(text):
    true = 1
    false = 0
    ## is_bold tells whether or not we are currently looking at 
    ## a bold section of text.
    is_bold = false
    ## start_block is the index of the start of either an unbolded 
    ## segment of text or a bolded segment.
    start_block = 0
    for index in range(len(text)):
        ## Handle a starting of bold text
        if text[index] == &quot;&lt;B&gt;&quot;:
            if is_bold:
                print(&quot;Error: Extra Bold&quot;)
            ## print &quot;Not Bold:&quot;, text[start_block:index]
            is_bold = true
            start_block = index + 1
        ## Handle end of bold text
        ## Remember that the last number in a slice is the index 
        ## after the last index used.
        if text[index] == &quot;&lt;/B&gt;&quot;:
            if not is_bold:
                print(&quot;Error: Extra Close Bold&quot;)
            print(&quot;Bold [&quot;, start_block, &quot;:&quot;, index, &quot;]&quot;, text[start_block:index])
            is_bold = false
            start_block = index + 1

get_bolds(poem)
&lt;/source&gt;

with the output being:

 Bold [ 1 : 4 ] ['Jack', 'and', 'Jill']
 Bold [ 11 : 15 ] ['fetch', 'a', 'pail', 'of']
 Bold [ 20 : 23 ] ['down', 'and', 'broke']
 Bold [ 28 : 30 ] ['Jill', 'came']

The &lt;code&gt;get_bold()&lt;/code&gt; function takes in a list that is broken into words and tokens.  The tokens that it looks for are &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;B&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which starts the bold text and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;/B&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which ends bold text. The function &lt;code&gt;get_bold()&lt;/code&gt; goes through and searches for the start and end tokens.

The next feature of lists is copying them.  If you try something simple like:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a = [1, 2, 3]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b = a'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [1, 2, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b[1] = 10'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [1, 10, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(a)'''
 [1, 10, 3]

This probably looks surprising since a modification to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;
resulted in &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; being changed as well.  What happened is that the
statement &lt;code&gt;b = a&lt;/code&gt; makes &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; a ''reference'' to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.
This means that &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; can be thought of as another name for &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.
Hence any modification to &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; changes &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; as well.  However
some assignments don't create two names for one list:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a = [1, 2, 3]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b = a * 2'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(a)'''
 [1, 2, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a[1] = 10'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(a)'''
 [1, 10, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]

In this case &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is not a reference to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; since the expression &lt;code&gt;a * 2&lt;/code&gt; creates a new list. Then the statement
&lt;code&gt;b = a * 2&lt;/code&gt; gives &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; a reference to &lt;code&gt;a * 2&lt;/code&gt; rather than a reference to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;.  All assignment operations create a reference.
When you pass a list as an argument to a function you create a
reference as well.  Most of the time you don't have to worry about
creating references rather than copies.  However when you need to make
modifications to one list without changing another name of the list
you have to make sure that you have actually created a copy.

There are several ways to make a copy of a list.  The simplest that
works most of the time is the slice operator since it always makes a
new list even if it is a slice of a whole list:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a = [1, 2, 3]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b = a[:]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b[1] = 10'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(a)'''
 [1, 2, 3]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [1, 10, 3]

Taking the slice &lt;code&gt;[:]&lt;/code&gt; creates a new copy of the list. However it only copies the outer list.  Any sublist inside is still a references to the sublist in the original list.  Therefore, when the list contains lists, the inner lists have to be copied as well.  You could do that manually but Python already contains a module to do it.  You use the &lt;code&gt;deepcopy&lt;/code&gt; function of the &lt;code&gt;copy&lt;/code&gt; module:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''import copy'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b = a[:]'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''c = copy.deepcopy(a)'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''b[0][1] = 10'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''c[1][1] = 12'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(a)'''
 [[1, 10, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(b)'''
 [[1, 10, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(c)'''
 [[1, 2, 3], [4, 12, 6]]

First of all notice that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is a list of lists.  Then notice
that when &lt;code&gt;b[0][1] = 10&lt;/code&gt; is run both &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; are changed, but &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; is not.  This happens because the inner arrays are still references when the slice operator is used.  However with &lt;code&gt;deepcopy&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt; was fully copied.

So, should I worry about references every time I use a function or
&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;?  The good news is that you only have to worry about
references when using dictionaries and lists.  Numbers and strings
create references when assigned but every operation on numbers and
strings that modifies them creates a new copy so you can never modify
them unexpectedly.  You do have to think about references when you are
modifying a list or a dictionary.

By now you are probably wondering why are references used at all?  The
basic reason is speed.  It is much faster to make a reference to a
thousand element list than to copy all the elements.  The other reason
is that it allows you to have a function to modify the inputed list
or dictionary.  Just remember about references if you ever have some
weird problem with data being changed when it shouldn't be.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- things to talk about: chr ord float int len repr s+b s[i] s[i:j] s*n find rfind replace strip --&gt;
&lt;!-- Start with indexing, user chr and ord to show how to do manual int&lt;-&gt;string --&gt;
&lt;!-- Repeate the &lt;B&gt; with slices and do actual html --&gt;
&lt;!-- Do some more phrasing --&gt;
&lt;!----&gt;
&lt;!-- Okay here is todays typing exercise: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- def to_string(in_int): --&gt;
&lt;!--     &quot;Converts an integer to a string&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--     out_str = &quot;&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--     prefix = &quot;&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--     if in_int &lt; 0: --&gt;
&lt;!--         prefix = &quot;-&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--         in_int = -in_int         --&gt;
&lt;!--     while in_int / 10 != 0: --&gt;
&lt;!--         out_str = chr(ord('0')+in_int % 10) + out_str --&gt;
&lt;!--         in_int = in_int / 10 --&gt;
&lt;!--     out_str = chr(ord('0')+in_int % 10) + out_str --&gt;
&lt;!--     return prefix + out_str --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- def to_int(in_str): --&gt;
&lt;!--     &quot;Converts a string to an integer&quot; --&gt;
&lt;!--     out_num = 0 --&gt;
&lt;!--     if in_str[0] == &quot;-&quot;: --&gt;
&lt;!--         multiplier = -1 --&gt;
&lt;!--         in_str = in_str[1:] --&gt;
&lt;!--     else: --&gt;
&lt;!--         multiplier = 1 --&gt;
&lt;!--     for x in range(0,len(in_str)): --&gt;
&lt;!--         out_num = out_num * 10 + ord(in_str[x]) - ord('0') --&gt;
&lt;!--     return out_num * multiplier --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_string(2) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_string(23445) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_string(-23445) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_int(&quot;14234&quot;) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_int(&quot;12345&quot;) --&gt;
&lt;!-- print to_int(&quot;-3512&quot;) --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- The output is: --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!-- 2 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 23445 --&gt;
&lt;!-- -23445 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 14234 --&gt;
&lt;!-- 12345 --&gt;
&lt;!-- -3512 --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;/source&gt; --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- So how does it work?  The first detail to notice is that it defines two different functions, one that converts a string to a number and one that converts a number to a string.  Notice that this function does string manipulation similar to how lists can be manipulated.  For example the line &lt;code&gt;if in_str[0] == &quot;-&quot;&lt;/code&gt; uses indexing to look at the first letter in the string.  Another thing that strings can do that lists can is using slices.  The line &lt;code&gt;in_str = in_str[1:]&lt;/code&gt; uses slices to get all but the first character of in_str (or drops the first letter).  However you cannot use slices or indexing to assign to a letter or location in a string. --&gt;
&lt;!--  --&gt;
&lt;!-- Two new things to introduced are the functions &lt;code&gt;ord&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;chr&lt;/code&gt;.  The  --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;code&gt;ord&lt;/code&gt; function takes a character (a string of length one) and returns the ASCII value of the character.  The function &lt;code&gt;chr&lt;/code&gt; is its inverse and takes a ASCII value and returns a character.  The expression &lt;code&gt;ord(in_str[x]) - ord('0')&lt;/code&gt; uses the &lt;code&gt;ord&lt;/code&gt; function to find the value of a string.  This works since '0' through '9' have ASCII values that are all in a row.  The ASCII value of '0' is 48 and the ASCII value of '9' is 57 so when we subtract 57-48 we get 9 and this works similarly with other numbers.  The expression &lt;code&gt;chr(ord('0')+in_int % 10)&lt;/code&gt; works in a similar manor but in reverse.
--&gt;
And now presenting a cool trick that can be done with strings:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def shout(string):
    for character in string:
        print(&quot;Gimme a &quot; + character)
        print(&quot;'&quot; + character + &quot;'&quot;)

shout(&quot;Lose&quot;)

def middle(string):
    print(&quot;The middle character is:&quot;, string[len(string) // 2])

middle(&quot;abcdefg&quot;)
middle(&quot;The Python Programming Language&quot;)
middle(&quot;Atlanta&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

And the output is:

 Gimme a L
 'L'
 Gimme a o
 'o'
 Gimme a s
 's'
 Gimme a e
 'e'
 The middle character is: d
 The middle character is: r
 The middle character is: a

What these programs demonstrate is that strings are similar to lists in several ways.  The &lt;code&gt;shout()&lt;/code&gt; function shows that &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops can be used with strings just as they can be used with lists.  The &lt;code&gt;middle&lt;/code&gt; procedure shows that that strings can also use the &lt;code&gt;len()&lt;/code&gt; function and array indexes and slices.  Most list features work on strings as well.

The next feature demonstrates some string specific features:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def to_upper(string):
    ## Converts a string to upper case
    upper_case = &quot;&quot;
    for character in string:
        if 'a' &lt;= character &lt;= 'z':
            location = ord(character) - ord('a')
            new_ascii = location + ord('A')
            character = chr(new_ascii)
        upper_case = upper_case + character
    return upper_case

print(to_upper(&quot;This is Text&quot;))
&lt;/source&gt;

with the output being:

 THIS IS TEXT

This works because the computer represents the characters of a string as numbers from 0 to 1,114,111.  For example 'A' is 65, 'B' is 66 and א is 1488. The values are the [[w:en:unicode|unicode]] value.  Python has a function called &lt;code&gt;ord()&lt;/code&gt; (short for ordinal) that returns a character as a number.  There is also a corresponding function called &lt;code&gt;chr()&lt;/code&gt; that converts a number into a character.  With this in mind the program should start to be clear.  The first detail is the line: &lt;code&gt;if 'a' &lt;= character &lt;= 'z':&lt;/code&gt; which checks to see if a letter is lower case.  If it is then the next lines are used.  First it is converted into a location so that a&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, b&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, c&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 and so on with the line: &lt;code&gt;location = ord(character) - ord('a')&lt;/code&gt;.  Next the new value is found with &lt;code&gt;new_ascii = location + ord('A')&lt;/code&gt;.  This value is converted back to a character that is now upper case.  Note that if you really need the upper case of a letter, you should use &lt;code&gt;u=var.upper()&lt;/code&gt; which will work with other languages as well.  

Now for some interactive typing exercise:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# Integer to String'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''2'''
 2
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(2)'''
 '2'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''-123'''
 -123
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(-123)'''
 '-123'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# String to Integer'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;23&quot;'''
 '23'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''int(&quot;23&quot;)'''
 23
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;23&quot; * 2'''
 '2323'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''int(&quot;23&quot;) * 2'''
 46
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# Float to String'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''1.23'''
 1.23
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(1.23)'''
 '1.23'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# Float to Integer'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''1.23'''
 1.23
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''int(1.23)'''
 1
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''int(-1.23)'''
 -1
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''# String to Float'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''float(&quot;1.23&quot;)'''
 1.23
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;1.23&quot;''' 
 '1.23'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''float(&quot;123&quot;)'''
 123.0

If you haven't guessed already the function &lt;code&gt;repr()&lt;/code&gt; can convert an integer to a string and the function &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; can convert a string to an integer. The function &lt;code&gt;float()&lt;/code&gt; can convert a string to a float.  The &lt;code&gt;repr()&lt;/code&gt; function returns a printable representation of something. Here are some examples of this:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(1)'''
 '1'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr(234.14)'''
 '234.14'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''repr([4, 42, 10])'''
 '[4, 42, 10]'

The &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; function tries to convert a string (or a float) into an integer.  There is also a similar function called &lt;code&gt;float()&lt;/code&gt; that will convert a integer or a string into a float.  Another function that Python has is the &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; function.  The &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; function takes a string and returns data of the type that python thinks it found.  For example:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''v = eval('123')'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(v, type(v))'''
 123 &lt;type 'int'&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''v = eval('645.123')'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(v, type(v))'''
 645.123 &lt;type 'float'&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''v = eval('[1, 2, 3]')'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''print(v, type(v))'''
 [1, 2, 3] &lt;type 'list'&gt;

If you use the &lt;code&gt;eval()&lt;/code&gt; function you should check that it returns the type that you expect.

One useful string function is the &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; method. Here's an example:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''&quot;This is a bunch of words&quot;.split()'''
 ['This', 'is', 'a', 'bunch', 'of', 'words']
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''text = &quot;First batch, second batch, third, fourth&quot;'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''text.split(&quot;,&quot;)'''
 ['First batch', ' second batch', ' third', ' fourth']

Notice how &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; converts a string into a list of strings.  The string is split by whitespace by default or by the optional argument (in this case a comma).
You can also add another argument that tells &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; how many times the separator will be used to split the text. For example:

 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list = text.split(&quot;,&quot;)'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''len(list)'''
 4
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list[-1]'''
 ' fourth'
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list = text.split(&quot;,&quot;, 2)'''
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''len(list)'''
 3
 &gt;&gt;&gt; '''list[-1]'''
 ' third, fourth'

&lt;!-- TODO add more on strings --&gt;
=== Slicing strings (and lists) ===

Strings can be cut into pieces &amp;mdash; in the same way as it was shown for lists in the previous chapter &amp;mdash; by using the ''slicing'' &quot;operator&quot; &lt;tt&gt;[]&lt;/tt&gt;. The slicing operator works in the same way as before: text[first_index:last_index] (in very rare cases there can be another colon and a third argument, as in the example shown below).

In order not to get confused by the index numbers, it is easiest to see them as ''clipping places'', possibilities to cut a string into parts. Here is an example, which shows the clipping places (in yellow) and their index numbers (red and blue) for a simple text string:

&lt;tt&gt;
{| style=&quot;text-align:center&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0px&quot;
|
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:red&quot; |0
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:red&quot; |1
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:red&quot; |2
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; | ...
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:blue&quot; | -2
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex;color:blue&quot; | -1
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
| style=&quot;width:2ex&quot; |
|-
|
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;darr;
|
|-
| text = 
|&quot;
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!S 
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!T
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!R
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!I
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!N
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
!G
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|&quot;
|-
|
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;uarr;
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |
|
| style=&quot;background:#FFFF88&quot; |&amp;uarr;
|
|-
|
|
|[:
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|
|:]
|
|}
&lt;/tt&gt;

Note that the red indexes are counted from the beginning of the string and the blue ones from the end of the string backwards. (Note that there is no blue -0, which could seem to be logical at the end of the string. Because &lt;tt&gt;-0 == 0&lt;/tt&gt;, -0 means &quot;beginning of the string&quot; as well.)  Now we are ready to use the indexes for slicing operations:

&lt;tt&gt;
{|
|-
|text[1:4] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;TRI&quot;
|-
|text[:5] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;STRIN&quot;
|-
|text[:-1] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;STRIN&quot;
|-
|text[-4:] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;RING&quot;
|-
|text[2] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;R&quot;
|-
|text[:] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;STRING&quot;
|-
|text[::-1] || style=&quot;width:3em;text-align:center&quot; | &amp;rarr; || &quot;GNIRTS&quot;
|}
&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;text[1:4]&lt;/tt&gt; gives us all of the &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; string between clipping places 1 and 4, &quot;&lt;tt&gt;TRI&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. If you omit one of the [first_index:last_index] arguments, you get the beginning or end of the string as default: &lt;tt&gt;text[:5]&lt;/tt&gt; gives &quot;&lt;tt&gt;STRIN&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. For both &lt;tt&gt;first_index&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;last_index&lt;/tt&gt; we can use both the red and the blue numbering schema: &lt;tt&gt;text[:-1]&lt;/tt&gt; gives the same as &lt;tt&gt;text[:5]&lt;/tt&gt;, because the index -1 is at the same place as 5 in this case. If we do not use an argument containing a colon, the number is treated in a different way: &lt;tt&gt;text[2]&lt;/tt&gt; gives us one character following the second clipping point, &quot;&lt;tt&gt;R&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;. The special slicing operation &lt;tt&gt;text[:]&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;from the beginning to the end&quot; and produces a copy of the entire string (or list, as shown in the previous chapter).

Last but not least, the slicing operation can have a second colon and a third argument, which is interpreted as the &quot;step size&quot;: &lt;tt&gt;text[::-1]&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;text&lt;/tt&gt; from beginning to the end, with a step size of -1. -1 means &quot;every character, but in the other direction&quot;. &quot;&lt;tt&gt;STRING&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; backwards is &quot;&lt;tt&gt;GNIRTS&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; (test a step length of 2, if you have not got the point here).

All these slicing operations work with lists as well. In that sense strings are just a special case of lists, where the list elements are single characters. Just remember the concept of ''clipping places'', and the indexes for slicing things will get a lot less confusing.

=== Examples ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This program requires an excellent understanding of decimal numbers.
def to_string(in_int):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Converts an integer to a string&quot;&quot;&quot;
    out_str = &quot;&quot;
    prefix = &quot;&quot;
    if in_int &lt; 0:
        prefix = &quot;-&quot;
        in_int = -in_int
    while in_int // 10 != 0:
        out_str = str(in_int % 10) + out_str
        in_int = in_int // 10
    out_str = str(in_int % 10) + out_str
    return prefix + out_str

def to_int(in_str):
    &quot;&quot;&quot;Converts a string to an integer&quot;&quot;&quot;
    out_num = 0
    if in_str[0] == &quot;-&quot;:
        multiplier = -1
        in_str = in_str[1:]
    else:
        multiplier = 1
    for c in in_str:
        out_num = out_num * 10 + int(c)
    return out_num * multiplier

print(to_string(2))
print(to_string(23445))
print(to_string(-23445))
print(to_int(&quot;14234&quot;))
print(to_int(&quot;12345&quot;))
print(to_int(&quot;-3512&quot;))
&lt;/source&gt;

The output is:

 2
 23445
 -23445
 14234
 12345
 -3512

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== File I/O ===

Here is a simple example of file I/O (input/output):
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Write a file
with open(&quot;test.txt&quot;, &quot;wt&quot;) as out_file:
    out_file.write(&quot;This Text is going to out file\nLook at it and see!&quot;)

# Read a file
with open(&quot;test.txt&quot;, &quot;rt&quot;) as in_file:
    text = in_file.read()

print(text)
&lt;/source&gt;

The output and the contents of the file &lt;code&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; are:

 This Text is going to out file
 Look at it and see!

Notice that it wrote a file called &lt;code&gt;test.txt&lt;/code&gt; in the directory that you ran the program from.  The &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt; in the string tells Python to put a ''n''ewline where it is.  

A overview of file I/O is:
* Get a file object with the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; function
* Read or write to the file object (depending on how it was opened)
* If you did not use &lt;code&gt;with&lt;/code&gt; to open the file, you'd have to close it manually

The first step is to get a file object.  The way to do this is to use the &lt;code&gt;open&lt;/code&gt; function.  The format is &lt;code&gt;file_object = open(filename, mode)&lt;/code&gt;  where &lt;code&gt;file_object&lt;/code&gt; is the variable to put the file object, &lt;code&gt;filename&lt;/code&gt; is a string with the filename, and &lt;code&gt;mode&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;&quot;rt&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to ''r''ead a file as ''t''ext or &lt;code&gt;&quot;wt&quot;&lt;/code&gt; to ''w''rite a file as ''t''ext (and a few others we will skip here).  Next the file objects functions can be called.  The two most common functions are &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; function adds a string to the end of the file.  The &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; function reads the next thing in the file and returns it as a string.  If no argument is given it will return the whole file (as done in the example).  

Now here is a new version of the phone numbers program that we made earlier:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def print_numbers(numbers):
    print(&quot;Telephone Numbers:&quot;)
    for k, v in numbers.items():
        print(&quot;Name:&quot;, k, &quot;\tNumber:&quot;, v)
    print()

def add_number(numbers, name, number):
    numbers[name] = number

def lookup_number(numbers, name):
    if name in numbers:
        return &quot;The number is &quot; + numbers[name]
    else:
        return name + &quot; was not found&quot;

def remove_number(numbers, name):
    if name in numbers:
        del numbers[name]
    else:
        print(name,&quot; was not found&quot;)

def load_numbers(numbers, filename):
    in_file = open(filename, &quot;rt&quot;)
    while True:
        in_line = in_file.readline()
        if not in_line:
            break
        in_line = in_line[:-1]
        name, number = in_line.split(&quot;,&quot;)
        numbers[name] = number

The new portions of this program are:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def load_numbers(numbers, filename):
    in_file = open(filename, &quot;rt&quot;)
    while True:
        in_line = in_file.readline()
        if not in_line:
            break
        in_line = in_line[:-1]
        name, number = in_line.split(&quot;,&quot;)
        numbers[name] = number
    in_file.close()

def save_numbers(numbers, filename):
    out_file = open(filename, &quot;wt&quot;)
    for k, v in numbers.values():
        out_file.write(k + &quot;,&quot; + v + &quot;\n&quot;)
    out_file.close()
&lt;/source&gt;

First we will look at the save portion of the program.  First it creates a file object with the command &lt;code&gt;open(filename, &quot;wt&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;.  Next it goes through and creates a line for each of the phone numbers with the command &lt;code&gt;out_file.write(x + &quot;,&quot; + numbers[x] + &quot;\n&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;.  This writes out a line that contains the name, a comma, the number and follows it by a newline.

The loading portion is a little more complicated.  It starts by getting a file object.  Then it uses a &lt;code&gt;while True:&lt;/code&gt; loop to keep looping until a &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statement is encountered.  Next it gets a line with the line &lt;code&gt;in_line = in_file.readline()&lt;/code&gt;.  The &lt;code&gt;readline&lt;/code&gt; function will return a empty string when the end of the file is reached. The &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement checks for this and &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;s out of the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop when that happens.  Of course if the &lt;code&gt;readline&lt;/code&gt; function did not return the newline at the end of the line there would be no way to tell if an empty string was an empty line or the end of the file so the newline is left in what &lt;code&gt;readline&lt;/code&gt; returns.  Hence we have to get rid of the newline.  The line &lt;code&gt;in_line = in_line[:-1]&lt;/code&gt; does this for us by dropping the last character.  Next the line &lt;code&gt;name, number = in_line.split(&quot;,&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; splits the line at the comma into a name and a number.  This is then added to the &lt;code&gt;numbers&lt;/code&gt; dictionary.

=== Advanced use of .txt files ===

You might be saying to yourself, &quot;Well I know how to read and write to a textfile, but what if I want to print the file without opening out another program?&quot;

There are a few different ways to accomplish this. The easiest way does open another program, but everything is taken care of in the Python code, and doesn't require the user to specify a file to be printed. This method involves invoking the subprocess of another program. 

Remember the file we wrote output to in the above program? Let's use that file. 
Keep in mind, in order to prevent some errors, this program uses concepts from the Next chapter. Please feel free to revisit this example after the next chapter.

&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
import subprocess
def main():
    try:
        print(&quot;This small program invokes the print function in the Notepad application&quot;)
        #Lets print the file we created in the program above
        subprocess.call(['notepad','/p','numbers.txt'])
    except WindowsError:
        print(&quot;The called subprocess does not exist, or cannot be called.&quot;)

main()
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;subprocess.call&lt;/code&gt; takes three arguments. The first argument in the context of this example, should be the name of the program which you would like to invoke the printing subprocess from. The second argument should be the specific subprocess within that program. For simplicity, just understand that in this program, &lt;code&gt;'/p'&lt;/code&gt; is the subprocess used to access your printer through the specified application. The last argument should be the name of the file you want to send to the printing subprocess. In this case, it is the same file used earlier in this chapter.

=== Storing and loading music saved in a text file ===
This section will demonstrate how we can store simple melodies in a file. We can then write a program that reads the file and plays the melody on a Linkbot.

==== A little music theory ====
To fully understand the sample program, we will need a little knowledge about music theory. If you don't care about music theory and you just want to get the Linkbot to play music, you can skip to the next section.

What is music? Music is a series of notes played in a certain order. Sometimes, more than one note is played together. Each note is played for a certain duration. Notes themselves are vibrations in the air that we can hear. Each note has a certain frequency of vibration; when the frequency changes, the perceived pitch of the note changes too.

Each note has a name. If you know it's name, you can find it on a piano keyboard, and vice versa. You may have heard the term &quot;Middle-C&quot;, or the phrase &quot;Do-Re-Mi&quot;. These are both ways to refer to notes. If you are familiar with a piano keyboard, you will know that the &quot;C&quot; note appears more than once on the keyboard. When you play the C notes, you'll notice that they don't sound the same, but they are all called &quot;C&quot;. It turns out that there are 12 tones that repeat over and over again. Starting at C, they are:
* C
* C# (Db)
* D
* D# (Eb)
* E
* F
* F# (Gb)
* G
* G# (Ab)
* A
* A# (Bb)
* B

The &quot;#&quot; symbol is pronounced &quot;sharp&quot;, so C# is pronounced &quot;See-Sharp&quot;. The &quot;sharp&quot; indicates that the tone is one step higher than the normal note. For instance, &quot;A#&quot; is one step higher than &quot;A&quot;. You might also be familiar with another symbol that looks like a lowercase b. That symbol is pronounced &quot;flat&quot;, so &quot;Bb&quot; is pronounced &quot;B-flat&quot;. It has the opposite meaning of sharp, indicating that the note is one step lower than the un-flatted note. This means that the note &quot;G#&quot; is actually the same note as &quot;Ab&quot;. For now, we will only use sharps to avoid confusion. On a piano keyboard, all of the sharp/flat notes are the black keys and the rest of the notes are the white keys.

On a piano keyboard, these notes repeat over and over again, so we must devise a way to specifically refer which A or B or C we are referring to. To do this, we introduce the concept of an octave number. The lowest note a piano can play is called &quot;A0&quot;, where 0 is the octave number. Going from left to right on a piano keyboard, the octave number increases every time you encounter the C note. Thus, the first several white keys on a piano keyboard from left to right are:
* A0
* B0
* C1
* D1
* E1
* F1
* G1
* A1
* B1
* C2
* etc...

Now, we have a way to specify &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; what key on a keyboard we are referring to using a string such as &quot;F#5&quot;. 

We also have an equation where we can calculate the frequency of a note depending on how many steps away it is from our &quot;A0&quot; note.
The equation is:

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{frequency} = 27.5 * 2^{\mathrm{steps}/12}
&lt;/math&gt;

For instance, G0 is -2 steps away from A0, and B0 is 2 steps away from A0. For notes in the same octave, we can simply count the number of black and white keys to find the distance away from A, but how about different octaves? For instance, how many keys away is A0 from B4? 

First, lets consider how many notes away A4 is from A0. When we count the keys, each octave is 12 notes. Since A4 is 4 octave away from 0 (4-0 = 4) , A4 is 4*12=48 keys away from A0. 

How about A0 and B4? A0 is 2 keys away from B0, and B0 is 4*12 keys away from B4, so in total, A0 is 2+4*12 = 50 keys away from B4. Now, we can write an equation to figure out exactly how many keys away any note is from A0. Lets use the variable &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; for the note name we want, and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; for the octave of the note. Then,

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{offset}(n, v) = n-\mathrm(A0) + 12*v
&lt;/math&gt;

==== Reading and playing a melody from a file ====
First, let us write a function that takes a string describing a note such as &quot;A4&quot; and gives us a frequency for that note. Here is our strategy:
* We receive a string describing the note. The first character is the letter name of the note. We calculate the offset of that letter name from the &quot;A&quot; note. For instance, &quot;B&quot; would have an offset of +2 and &quot;E&quot; would have an offset of -5. We find these offsets simply by counting the keys on a keyboard.
* The next character in the string might be a &quot;#&quot; sharp or a &quot;b&quot; flat. If it is sharp, increase the offset by one. If it is flat, decrease it by one. If it is neither, don't do anything.
* The final character is the octave number. We multiply this number by 12 and add it to our offset.
* The result is the number of keys away the note is away from A0. We can now use the equation &lt;math&gt; f = 27.5 * 2^{\mathrm{offset}/12} &lt;/math&gt; to find the frequency based on the key offset from A0.

Next, lets talk about our file format. Since the Linkbot can only play one note at a time, the file should specify single notes for the Linkbot to play. Also, the file should specify how many seconds to play each note. We choose to have our file such that each line contains a note name such as &quot;C4&quot; or &quot;Bb3&quot;, along with a note duration in seconds.

Here is a file that we have created for you:

&lt;b&gt;fur_elise.txt&lt;/b&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

# &lt;code&gt;note[0].upper()&lt;/code&gt; takes the first character and uppercases it. We want to uppercase anything that comes in just in case the user used a lowercase note name, like &quot;e4&quot;. Since we wrote our dictionary with uppercase note names, we need to make sure the incoming note names are upper-case too so that it can be matched with the ones in our dictionary.
# The &quot;-1&quot; index means the last item of a list. Since all of the items in our list are strings, we need to convert it to an integer with &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt;.
# This loop goes through every single line in the music file, line by line. Each time, it stores the text of the line in the &lt;code&gt;line&lt;/code&gt; variable.
# The &lt;code&gt;split()&lt;/code&gt; function splits lines of text based on whitespace. For instance, &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello there&quot;.split()&lt;/code&gt; becomes the list &lt;code&gt; [&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;there&quot;] &lt;/code&gt;. Since each line in our text file has 2 &quot;words&quot;, the first part (the note name) is stored into our variable &lt;code&gt;data[0]&lt;/code&gt;, and the second part (the note duration) is stored into &lt;code&gt;data[1]&lt;/code&gt;.

Write a program that reads a text file containing motor angles, such as 
&lt;pre&gt;
90 45 20
180 22 -180
5 32 0
&lt;/pre&gt;
Each triplet of numbers represents three motor angles. Write a program that moves the Linkbot's joints to those positions with the &lt;code&gt;moveTo()&lt;/code&gt; function for each line in the data file.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== ...or how to handle errors ===

=== closing files with with ===

We use the &quot;with&quot; statement to open and close files.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://docs.python.org/3.4/reference/compound_stmts.html#the-with-statement &quot;The 'with' statement&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://preshing.com/20110920/the-python-with-statement-by-example/ 'The Python &quot;with&quot; Statement by Example']
&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
with open(&quot;in_test.txt&quot;, &quot;rt&quot;) as in_file:
    with open(&quot;out_test.txt&quot;, &quot;wt&quot;) as out_file:
        text = in_file.read()
        data = parse(text)
        results = encode(data)
        out_file.write(results)
    print( &quot;All done.&quot; )
&lt;/source&gt;

If some sort of error happens anywhere in this code
(one of the files is inaccessible,
the parse() function chokes on corrupt data,
etc.)
the &quot;with&quot; statements guarantee that all the files will eventually be properly closed. Closing a file just means that the file is &quot;cleaned up&quot; and &quot;released&quot; by our program so that it can be used in another program.

{{todo|
Is the &quot;closing files with with&quot; section too much detail for a non-programmers tutorial?
If so, move it to some other Python Wikibook ([[Subject:Python programming language]])
}}

=== catching errors with try ===
So you now have the perfect program, it runs flawlessly, except for one detail, it will crash on invalid user input.  Have no fear, for Python has a special control structure for you.  It's called &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; and it tries to do something.  Here is an example of a program with a problem:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Type Control C or -1 to exit&quot;)
number = 1
while number != -1:
   number = int(input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;))
   print(&quot;You entered:&quot;, number)
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice how when you enter &lt;code&gt;@#&amp;&lt;/code&gt; it outputs something like:

 Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;try_less.py&quot;, line 4, in &lt;module&gt;
    number = int(input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;))
 ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '\\@#&amp;'

As you can see the &lt;code&gt;int()&lt;/code&gt; function is unhappy with the number &lt;code&gt;@#&amp;&lt;/code&gt; (as well it should be).  The last line shows what the problem is; Python found a &lt;code&gt;ValueError&lt;/code&gt;.   How can our program deal with this?  What we do is first: put the place where errors may occur in a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block, and second: tell Python how we want &lt;code&gt;ValueError&lt;/code&gt;s handled.  The following program does this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Type Control C or -1 to exit&quot;)
number = 1
while number != -1:
    try:
        number = int(input(&quot;Enter a number: &quot;))
        print(&quot;You entered:&quot;, number)
    except ValueError:
        print(&quot;That was not a number.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Now when we run the new program and give it &lt;code&gt;@#&amp;&lt;/code&gt; it tells us &quot;That was not a number.&quot; and continues with what it was doing before.

When your program keeps having some error that you know how to handle, put code in a &lt;code&gt;try&lt;/code&gt; block, and put the way to handle the error in the &lt;code&gt;except&lt;/code&gt; block.

=== Generating Errors: Controlling a Linkbot's Speed ===
We've seen in previous examples that we can write a function that makes a wheeled robot travel a certain distance. We can also control the rotational velocity of the motors with the &lt;code&gt;setJointSpeed()&lt;/code&gt; function. The &lt;code&gt;setJointSpeed()&lt;/code&gt; function expects a rotational speed with units of degrees/sec, but it would be nice if we could have a function where we could set the robot speed using inches/sec. The math equation to convert &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; inches/sec to &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; degrees/sec is

&lt;math&gt; \omega\mathrm{(deg/sec)} = \frac{v\mathrm{(inches/sec)}}{r\mathrm{(inches)}} * \frac{180\mathrm{(degrees)}}{\pi\mathrm{(radians)}} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the wheel radius. Lets expand our example from the [[../Defining Functions]] section:

{{Message box|heading = Terminology| message = 
The character &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is &quot;omega&quot; and is commonly used to represent rotational velocities. Typically, the units of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; are in radians/second, but in this example, the units are in degrees/second.
}}

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo
import math # So that we can use math.pi
dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect() 
myLinkbot = dongle.getLinkbot('abcd') # Change abcd to your Linkbot's serial ID

def driveDistance(linkbot, distance):
    r = 3.5 / 2 # If you have a wheel that's not 3.5 inches in diameter, change &quot;3.5&quot; to the diameter of your wheel
    degrees = (360) / (2 * math.pi * r) * distance
    linkbot.move(degrees, 0, -degrees)

def setSpeed(linkbot, speed):
    r = 3.5 / 2
    omega = (speed/r) * (180/math.pi)
    linkbot.setJointSpeed(1, omega)
    linkbot.setJointSpeed(3, omega)

setSpeed(myLinkbot, 2.5)     # Sets the speed to 2.5 inches/sec
driveDistance(myLinkbot, 10) # Drives the Linkbot 10 inches forward
driveDistance(myLinkbot, -5) # Drives the Linkbot 5 inches backward
&lt;/source&gt;

This example is all well and good. We define a new function &lt;code&gt;setSpeed()&lt;/code&gt; that sets the speed of a Linkbot wheeled vehicle and we use it to set the speed to 2.5 inches per second. 

What if the programmer tries to set the speed to 1,000 inches/second? Or 1,000,000 inches/second? Although it would be cool to see a Linkbot compete with a Formula One race car, there are physical limitations that prevent the Linkbot's motors from moving more than 200 degrees/second. If the speed is too high, we should set an error the user can see and possibly deal with. This is called &quot;raising an exception&quot;. The code to raise an exception looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def setSpeed(linkbot, speed):
    r = 3.5 / 2
    omega = (speed/r) * (180/math.pi)
    if omega &gt; 200:
        raise Exception('The speed is too high!')
    linkbot.setJointSpeed(1, omega)
    linkbot.setJointSpeed(3, omega)

&lt;/source&gt;

When an exception is raised, the function immediately returns with the exception. These raised exceptions can be caught by try/except blocks. If the exception occurred outside of a try/except block, the entire program will quit and display the error message of the exception. In the &lt;code&gt;setSpeed()&lt;/code&gt; function, this means that if the &lt;code&gt;raise&lt;/code&gt; is executed, the two &lt;code&gt;setJointSpeed()&lt;/code&gt; statements will be skipped.

When I run the new program and I try to set the speed to 1000 inches a second, I get this output:

&lt;pre&gt;
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;./linkbot_speed.py&quot;, line 20, in &lt;module&gt;
    setSpeed(myLinkbot, 1000)     # Sets the speed to 1000 inches/sec
  File &quot;./linkbot_speed.py&quot;, line 16, in setSpeed
    raise Exception('The speed is too high!')
Exception: The speed is too high!
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now you can use try/catch blocks to deal with possible errors. Lets try writing a program that tries to set the speed to 10 inches per second again, except every time it encounters an exception, in reduces the requested speed by 1 inch/second and tries again.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo                                                                    
import math # So that we can use math.pi                                         
dongle = barobo.Dongle()                                                         
dongle.connect()                                                                 
myLinkbot = dongle.getLinkbot('ABCD') # Change ABCD to your Linkbot's serial ID        
                                                                                 
def driveDistance(linkbot, distance):                                            
    r = 3.5 / 2 # If you have a wheel that's not 3.5 inches in diameter, change &quot;3.5&quot; to the diameter of your wheel
    degrees = (360) / (2 * math.pi * r) * distance                               
    linkbot.move(degrees, 0, -degrees)                                           
                                                                                 
def setSpeed(linkbot, speed):                                                    
    r = 3.5 / 2                                                                  
    omega = (speed/r) * (180/math.pi)                                            
    if omega &gt; 200:                                                              
        raise Exception('The speed is too high!')                                
    linkbot.setJointSpeed(1, omega)                                              
    linkbot.setJointSpeed(3, omega)                                              
                                                                                 
requestedSpeed = 10  # 1                                                             
while True:  # 2                                                                     
    try:                                                                         
        print('Trying to set speed to: ' + str(requestedSpeed) + 'inches/sec')
        setSpeed(myLinkbot, requestedSpeed)  # 3 
        print('Success!') 
        break  # 4
    except:                                                                      
        print('Failed.')                                                       
        requestedSpeed -= 1  # 5                                                   

# 6                                                                                 
driveDistance(myLinkbot, 10) # Drives the Linkbot 10 inches forward              
driveDistance(myLinkbot, -5) # Drives the Linkbot 5 inches backward
&lt;/source&gt;

The output is 
&lt;pre&gt;
Trying to set speed to: 10inches/sec
Failed.
Trying to set speed to: 9inches/sec
Failed.
Trying to set speed to: 8inches/sec
Failed.
Trying to set speed to: 7inches/sec
Failed.
Trying to set speed to: 6inches/sec
Success!
&lt;/pre&gt;

Lets step through this program together to make sure we fully understand what is happening.

* # 1 : When we first get to this line, we create a new variable called &lt;code&gt;requestedSpeed&lt;/code&gt; and set its value to &quot;10&quot;.
* # 2 : Enter an infinite loop
* # 3 : Try to set the speed. &lt;code&gt;requestedSpeed&lt;/code&gt; is currently 10, which is too high. The &lt;code&gt;setSpeed()&lt;/code&gt; function raises an exception. Since we are in a try/except block, we immediately go to the except block since an exception was thrown. Proceed to # 5
* # 5 : Decrease &lt;code&gt;requestedSpeed&lt;/code&gt; by one. &lt;code&gt;requestedSpeed&lt;/code&gt; is now 9. This is the end of our &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop, which means that Python goes back to the beginning of the loop. 
* # 3 : We end up at # 3 again, except &lt;code&gt;requestedSpeed&lt;/code&gt; is now 9. Still too high, exception is thrown.
* # 5 : Again, we decrease &lt;code&gt;requestedSpeed&lt;/code&gt; to 8.
* # 3 : Still too high...
* # 5 : Reduce to 7...
* # 3 : Still too high...
* # 5 : Reduce to 6.
* # 3 : Now it succeeds. Since it succeeded, no exception was raised. Continue to # 4
* # 4 : This &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statement pops us out of the loop. Proceed to # 6 and the rest of the program.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Recursion ==

In Python, a recursive function is a function which calls itself.

=== Introduction to recursion ===

So far, in Python, we have seen functions which call other functions. However, it is possible for a function to call itself. Lets look at a simple example.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Program by Mitchell Aikens
# No Copyright
# 2010

num = 0

def main():
    counter(num)

def counter(num):
    print(num)
    num += 1
    counter(num)

main()
&lt;/source&gt;

If you were to run this program in IDLE, it would run forever. The only way to stop the loop would be to interrupt the execution by pressing Ctrl + C on your keyboard. This is an example of an infinite recursion. (Some users have reported a glitch in the current IDLE system causing the exception raised by Ctrl + C to start looping as well. If this happens, press Ctrl + F6, and the IDLE shell should restart.)

It is arguable that recursion is just another way to accomplish the same thing as a while loop. In some cases, this is absolutely correct. Though, there are other uses for Recursion that are very valid, where &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops or &lt;code&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops may not be optimal.

Recursion can be controlled, just like loops. Lets look at an example of a controlled loop.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Program by Mitchell Aikens
# No copyright
# 2012
def main():
    loopnum = int(input(&quot;How many times would you like to loop?\n&quot;))
    counter = 1
    recurr(loopnum,counter)

def recurr(loopnum,counter):
    if loopnum &gt; 0:
        print(&quot;This is loop iteration&quot;,counter)
        recurr(loopnum - 1,counter + 1)
    else:
        print(&quot;The loop is complete.&quot;)

main()
&lt;/source&gt;

The above uses arguments/parameters to control the number of recursions. Simply use what you already know about functions and follow the flow of the program. It is simple to figure out. If you are having trouble, please refer back to [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3/Advanced Functions Example]].

== Practical Applications of Recursion ==

Often, recursion is studied at an advanced computer science level. Recursion is usually used to solve complex problems, that can be broken down into smaller, identical problems.
Recursion isn't required to solve a problem. Problems that can be solved with recursion, most likely can be solved with loops. Also, a loop may be more efficient than a recursive function. Recursive functions require more memory, and resources than loops, making them less efficient in a lot of cases. This usage requirement is sometimes referred to as &lt;i&gt;overhead&lt;/i&gt;.
You might be thinking, &quot;Well why bother with recursion. I'll just use a loop. I already know how to loop and this is a lot more work.&quot; This thought is understandable, but not entirely ideal. When solving complex problems, a recursive function is sometimes easier, faster, and simpler to build and code. 

Think of these two &quot;rules&quot;:
* If I can solve the problem now, without recursion, the function simply returns a value.
* If I cannot solve the problem now without recursion, the function reduces the problem to something smaller and similar, and calls itself to solve the problem.

Let's apply this using a common mathematical concept, factorials. If you are unfamiliar with factorials in mathematics, please refer to the following reading. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial Factorials]
 
The factorial of a number &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;, is denoted as &lt;i&gt;n!&lt;/i&gt;. 

Here are some basic rules of factorials.

If n = 0 then n! = 1
If n &gt; 0 then n! = 1 x 2 x 3 x ... x n

For example, let's look at the factorial of the number 9.

9! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6 x 7 x 8 x 9

Let's look at a program which calculates the factorial of any number entered by the user, by method of recursion.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def main():
    num = int(input(&quot;Please enter a non-negative integer.\n&quot;))
    fact = factorial(num)
    print(&quot;The factorial of&quot;,num,&quot;is&quot;,fact)

def factorial(num):
    if num == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return num * factorial(num - 1)

main()
&lt;/source&gt;

Recursion is also useful in an advanced topic called generators.  To generate the series 1,2,1,3,1,2,1,4,1,2... we would need this code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def crazy(min_):
    yield min_
    g=crazy(min_+1)
    while True:
        yield next(g)
        yield min_

i=crazy(1)
&lt;/source&gt;
to get the next element you would call next(i)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Object Oriented Programming==

:Up until now, the programming you have been doing has been procedural. However, a lot of programs today are Object Oriented. Knowing both types, and knowing the difference, is very important. Many important languages in computer science such as C++ and Java, often use OOP methods. 
    
:Beginners, and non-programmers often find the concept of OOP confusing, and complicated. This is normal. Don't be put off if you struggle or do not understand. There are plenty of other resources you can use to help overcome any issues you may have, if this chapter does not help you.

:This chapter will be broken up into different lessons. Each lesson will explain OOP in a different way, just to make sure OOP is covered as thoroughly as possible, because &lt;b&gt;IT IS VERY IMPORTANT.&lt;/b&gt; Before the lessons, there is an introduction which explains key concepts, terms, and other important areas of OOP, required to understand each lesson.

==Introduction==

Think of a procedure as a function. A function has a specific purpose. That purpose may be gathering input, performing mathematical calculations, displaying data, or manipulating data to, from, or in, a file. Typically, procedures use data which is separate from code for manipulation. This data is often passed between procedures. When a program becomes much larger and complex, this can cause problems.
For example, you have designed a program which stores information about a product in variables. When a customer requests information on a product, these variables are passed to different functions for different purposes. Later on, as more data is stored on these products, you decide to store the information in a list or dictionary. In order for your program to function, you must now edit each function that accepted variables, to now accept and manipulate a list or dictionary. Imagine the time that would take for a program that was hundreds of megabytes, and hundreds of files in size! It would drive you insane! not to mention, errors in your code, are almost guaranteed, just because of the large volume of work and possibilities to make a typo or other error. This is less than optimal.
Procedural programming is centered on procedures or functions. But, OOP is centered on creating Objects. Remember how a procedural program has separated data and code? Remember how that huge program was hundreds of files and would take FOREVER to edit? Well, think of an &lt;i&gt;object&lt;/i&gt; as a sort of &quot;combination&quot; of those files and data into one &quot;being&quot;. In a technical sense, an Object is an entity which contains data, AND procedures (code, functions, etc.). 

&lt;b&gt;Data inside an object is called a &lt;i&gt;data attribute&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Functions, or procedures inside the object are called &lt;i&gt;methods&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;


Think of &lt;b&gt;data attributes&lt;/b&gt; as variables. &lt;br /&gt;

Think of &lt;b&gt;methods&lt;/b&gt; as functions or procedures. &lt;br /&gt;

Let's look at a simple, everyday example. The light and light switch in your bedroom.
The data attributes would be as follows.

* light_on (True or False)
* switch_position (Up or Down)
* electricity_flow (True or False)

The methods would be as follows.

* move_switch
* change_electricity_flow

The data attributes may or may not be visible. For example, you cannot directly see the electricity flowing to the light. You only know there is electricity, because the light is on. However, you can see the position of the switch (switch_position), and you can see if the light is on or off (light_on). Some methods are &lt;i&gt;private&lt;/i&gt;. This means that you cannot directly change them. For example, unless you cut the wires in your light fixture (please don't do that, and for the sake of this example, assume that you don't know the wires exist), you cannot change the flow of electricity directly. You also cannot directly change if the light is on or off (and no, you can't unscrew the bulb! work with me here!). However, you can indirectly change these attributes by using the &lt;i&gt;methods&lt;/i&gt; in the object. If you don't pay your bill, the &lt;code&gt;change_electricity_flow&lt;/code&gt; method will change the value of the &lt;code&gt;electricity_flow&lt;/code&gt; attribute to FALSE. If you flip the switch, the &lt;code&gt;move_switch&lt;/code&gt; method changes the value of the &lt;code&gt;light_on&lt;/code&gt; attribute.

By now you're probably thinking, &quot;What does this have to do with Python?&quot; or, &quot;I understand, but how do I code an Object?&quot; Well, we are almost to that point! One more concept must be explained before we can dive into code.

In Python, an object's data attributes and methods are specified by a &lt;b&gt;class&lt;/b&gt;. Think of a class as a blueprint to an object. For example, your home - the object that you live in - you can also call it your pad, bungalow, crib, or whatever, was built based on a set of blueprints; these blueprints would be considered the class used to design your home, pad, crib, ahem, you get the idea.

Again, a class tells us how to make an object. In technical terms, and this is important here, a class defines the data attributes and methods inside an object.

To create a class, we code a &lt;i&gt;class definition&lt;/i&gt;. A class definition is a group of statements which define an object's data attributes and methods. 

&lt;big&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lesson One&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Below is a Procedural program that performs simple math on a single number, entered by a user.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;

# Program by Mitchell Aikens
# No Copyright
# 2012

# Procedure 1
def main():
    try:
        # Get a number to maniuplate
        num = float(input(&quot;Please enter a number to manipulate.\n&quot;))
        # Store the result of the value, after it has been manipulated
        # by Procedure 2
        addednum = addfive(num)
        # Store the result of the value, after it has been manipulated
        # by Procedure 3
        multipliednum = multiply(addednum)
        # Send the value to Procedure 4
        display(multipliednum)
    # Deal with exceptions from non-numeric user entry
    except ValueError:
        print(&quot;You must enter a valid number.\n&quot;)
        # Reset the value of num, to clear non-numeric data.
        num = 0
        # Call main, again.
        main()

# Procedure 2
def addfive(num):
    return num + 5

# Procedure 3
def multiply(addednum):
    return addednum * 2.452

# Procedure 4
def display(multi):
    # Display the final value
    print(&quot;The final value is &quot;,multi)

# Call Procedure 1
main()
&lt;/source&gt;

If we were to enter a value of &quot;5&quot;, the output would be as shown below.

 Please enter a number to manipulate.
 5
 The final value is  24.52

If we were to enter a value of &quot;g&quot;, and then correct the input and enter a value of &quot;8&quot;, the output would be as shown below.

 Please enter a number to manipulate.
 g
 You must enter a valid number.
 
 Please enter a number to manipulate.
 8
 The final value is  31.875999999999998

Below, is a Class, and a program which uses that class. This Object Oriented Program does the same thing as the procedural program above. Let's cover some important OOP coding concepts before we dive into the Class and program. 
To create a class, we use the &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; keyword. After the keyword, you type the name you want to name your class. It is common practice that the name of your class is capitalized.
If I wanted to create a class named dirtysocks, the code would be:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class Dirtysocks
&lt;/source&gt;

The Class is shown first. The program which uses the class is second.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Filename: oopexample.py
# Mitchell Aikens

# OOP Demonstration - Class

class Numchange:

    def __init__(self):
        self.__number = 0

    def addfive(self,num):
        self.__number = num
        return self.__number + 5

    def multiply(self,added):
        self.__added = added
        return self.__added * 2.452
&lt;/source&gt;

The program which uses the class above, is below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Filename: oopexampleprog.py
# Mitchell Aikens
# No Copyright
# 2012
# OOP Demonstration - Program

import oopexample

maths = oopexample.Numchange()

def main():

    num = float(input(&quot;Please enter a number.\n&quot;))

    added = maths.addfive(num)

    multip = maths.multiply(added)

    print(&quot;The manipulated value is &quot;,multip)

main()
&lt;/source&gt;

After looking at that program, you are probably a bit lost. That's OK. Lets start off by dissecting the class.
The class is named &quot;Numchange&quot;
There are three methods to this class:
* __init__
* addfive
* multiply

These three methods each have a similar code.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def __init__(self):
def addfive(self,num):
def multiply(self,added):
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice how each method has a parameter named &quot;self&quot;. this parameter must be present in each method of the class. This parameter doesn't HAVE TO be called &quot;self&quot;, but it is standard practice, which means you should probably stick with it. This parameter is required in each method because when a method executes, it has to know which object's attributes to operate on. Even though there is only one Object, we still need to make sure the interpreter knows that we want to use the data attributes in that class. So we play it safe...and use the &quot;self&quot; parameter.

Lets look at the first method. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def __init__(self):
&lt;/source&gt;

Most Classes in python have an &lt;code&gt;__init__&lt;/code&gt; which executes automatically when an instance of a class is created in memory.(When we reference a class, an &lt;i&gt;instance&lt;/i&gt; (or object)of that class is created). This method is commonly referred to as the &lt;i&gt;initializer method&lt;/i&gt;. When the method executes, the &quot;self&quot; parameter is automatically assigned to the object. This method is called the initializer method because is &quot;initializes&quot; the data attributes. 
Under the __init__ method, we set the value of the &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; method to 0 initially.
We reference the object attribute using dot notation. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def __init__(self):
    self.__number = 0
&lt;/source&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;self.__number = 0&lt;/code&gt; line simply means &quot;&quot;the value of the attribute &quot;number&quot;, in the object, is 0&quot;&quot;.

Let's look at the next method.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def addfive(self,num):
    self.__number = num
    return self.__number + 5
&lt;/source&gt;

This method is named &quot;addfive. It accepts a parameter called &quot;num&quot;, from the program using the class. The method then assigns the value of that parameter to the &quot;number&quot; attribute inside the object. The method then returns the value of &quot;number&quot;, with 5 added to it, to the statement which called the method.

Let's look at the third method.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def multiply(self,added):
    self.__added = added
    return self.__added * 2.453
&lt;/source&gt;

This method is named &quot;multiply&quot;. It accepts a parameter named &quot;added&quot;. It assigns the value of the parameter to the &quot;added&quot; attribute, and returns the value of the &quot;added&quot; attribute multiplied by 2.452, to the statement which called the method.

Notice how the name of each method begins with two underscores? Let's explain that.
Earlier we mentioned that an object operates on data attributes inside itself using methods. Ideally, these data attributes should be able to be manipulated ONLY BY METHODS IN THE OBJECT. It is possible to have outside code manipulate data attributes. To &quot;hide&quot; attributes, so only methods in the object can manipulate them, you use two underscores before the object name, as we have been demonstrating. Omitting those two underscores in the attribute name, allows for the possibility of manipulation from code outside the object.

Lets look at the program which uses the class we just dissected.

Notice the first line of non comment code.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import oopexample
&lt;/source&gt;

This line of code imports the class, which we have saved in a separate file (module). Classes do not have to be in a separate file, but it is almost always the case, and thus is good practice to get used to importing the module now.

The next line:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
maths = oopexample.Numchange()
&lt;/source&gt;

This line creates an instance of the Numchange class, stored in the module named &quot;oopexample&quot;, and stores the instance in the variable named &quot;maths&quot;.
The syntax is:
&lt;code&gt;&lt;i&gt;modulename.Classname()&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
Next we define the main function.
Then, we get a number from the user.

The next line &lt;code&gt;added = maths.addfive(num)&lt;/code&gt; sends the value of the &quot;num&quot; variable to the method named &quot;addfive&quot;, which is part of the class we stored an instance of in the variable named &quot;maths&quot;, and stores the returned value in the variable named &quot;added&quot;.

The next line &lt;code&gt;multip = maths.multiply(added)&lt;/code&gt; sends the value of the variable &quot;added&quot;, to the method named &quot;multiply&quot;, which is part of the class we stored an instance of in the variable named &quot;maths&quot;, and stores the returned value in the variable named &quot;multip&quot;.

The next line prints &quot;The manipulated value is &lt;value of multip&gt;&quot;. The last line calls the main function which executes the steps outlined above.

==Object Oriented Inheritance: Extending the Linkbot Class==
Throughout all of our code examples, you've been seeing these lines of code over and over again:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
...
myLinkbot = dongle.getLinkbot('ABCD')
...
myLinkbot.move() # etc etc
&lt;/source&gt;

If you guessed that the &lt;code&gt;myLinkbot&lt;/code&gt; variable is actually a Python object, you are correct! The &lt;code&gt;getLinkbot()&lt;/code&gt; function returns an object of the &lt;code&gt;Linkbot&lt;/code&gt; class, which is defined inside of the &lt;code&gt;barobo&lt;/code&gt; package. An extremely powerful and important concept that object-oriented languages use is a concept called &quot;inheritance&quot;. Sometimes, a programmer may want to create a new object that is very similar to or related to objects that have already been written. 

For instance, the &lt;code&gt;Linkbot&lt;/code&gt; class contains a variety of functions that move the motors, beeps the buzzer, etc. However, it would be nice if I could write my own object for controlling a Linkbot-I that has 2 wheels and a caster attached. I could call the new object &quot;LinkbotCar&quot;, and it could have member functions that make it drive forward, drive backward, turn, etc. At the same time, I still want the &lt;code&gt;LinkbotCar&lt;/code&gt; class to do everything that the original &lt;code&gt;Linkbot&lt;/code&gt; class did, such as changing LED colors and beeping the buzzer. Furthermore, it would be nice if the programmer didn't have to re-implement all of those methods that already exist inside the &lt;code&gt;Linkbot&lt;/code&gt; class. 

The solution to this situation is to write our &lt;code&gt;LinkbotCar&lt;/code&gt; class such that it &quot;extends&quot;, &quot;inherits from&quot;, or &quot;derives from&quot; (all of these terms are more-or-less interchangeable) the original &lt;code&gt;Linkbot&lt;/code&gt; class. Lets start by a quick example. Here is a program that creates a new &lt;code&gt;LinkbotCar&lt;/code&gt; class based on the original &lt;code&gt;Linkbot&lt;/code&gt; class, makes a new function called &lt;code&gt;driveForwardDistance&lt;/code&gt; which drives the wheeled robot forward a certain distance, and then beeps the buzzer for half a second.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo
import math  # for math.pi
import time  # for time.sleep()

class LinkbotCar(barobo.Linkbot):            # 1
    def driveForwardDistance(self, inches):  # 2
        wheelRadius = 3.5/2.0
        degrees = (360.0/(2.0*math.pi*wheelRadius)) * inches
        self.move(degrees, 0, -degrees)      # 3

dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect()
myLinkbotCar = dongle.getLinkbot('ABCD', LinkbotCar)  # 4

myLinkbotCar.driveForwardDistance(5)         # 5
myLinkbotCar.setBuzzerFrequency(440)         # 6
time.sleep(0.5)
myLinkbotCar.setBuzzerFrequency(0)
&lt;/source&gt;

# This line begins the process of making a new class called &quot;LinkbotCar&quot; based on the existing class &quot;barobo.Linkbot&quot;.
# Here, we define a new function called &quot;driveForwardDistance&quot; for the LinkbotCar class. The first argument for member functions represents the object itself. Although you can name this first variable whatever you want, all Python programmers use the name &quot;self&quot; by convention. The second argument is the number of inches we want the robot to travel.
# This is the line that actually makes the Linkbot move. Notice that we use the &lt;code&gt;move()&lt;/code&gt; function on the &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; variable here.
# Here, we gain control of the Linkbot through the dongle. Notice that the format of this function call is slightly different from what we've seen before. Not only is the requested Linkbot ID 'ABCD' specified, we also specify that we want a &quot;LinkbotCar&quot; object instead of a vanilla &quot;Linkbot&quot; object. Vanilla &quot;Linkbot&quot; objects do not have the new &lt;code&gt;driveForwardDistance&lt;/code&gt; member function that we just defined.
# At this line, we actually use our new function that we defined above. This makes the robot represented by the variable &lt;code&gt;myLinkbotCar&lt;/code&gt; drive forward 5 inches.
# Next, we make the Linkbot beep its buzzer. Notice that &lt;code&gt;setBuzzerFrequency()&lt;/code&gt; was originally a function inside the &lt;code&gt;barobo.Linkbot&lt;/code&gt; class. Because our object inherits from the original &lt;code&gt;barobo.Linkbot&lt;/code&gt; class, we can also call any member function that is in the &lt;code&gt;barobo.Linkbot&lt;/code&gt; class.

While this style of programming may seem cumbersome at first, there are many reasons to motivate this type of organization. For instance,
* &lt;b&gt; Why don't we just hard-code all of the Linkbot movements with &lt;code&gt;move()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;moveJoint()&lt;/code&gt; functions? &lt;/b&gt; This might be feasible for smaller programs, but imagine if you had to write a program where a wheeled Linkbot had to travel through a complex maze. If we need the Linkbot to accurately turn and travel more than 10 times, it is probably worth the time to write a function or class to make it easier on ourselves. In the long run, we would probably save time by writing the derived class.
* &lt;b&gt; Why is writing a class better than writing helper functions? &lt;/b&gt; One of the main benefits of writing a class is that someone else (or you) can inherit from your new class too. Lets say for instance you wrote a &lt;code&gt;LinkbotCar&lt;/code&gt; class that moves the Linkbot like a car and your buddy wrote a class called &lt;code&gt;LinkbotMelody&lt;/code&gt; that could make the Linkbot play complex songs using the buzzer. You could take the two classes and inherit from &lt;i&gt;both&lt;/i&gt; of them to create a new class that can drive the Linkbot like a car &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; play melodies!

==Exercises==
Continue extending the &lt;code&gt;LinkbotCar&lt;/code&gt; class by adding functions &lt;code&gt;turnLeft()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;turnRight()&lt;/code&gt;.

{{Solution|title = Solution| text=

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Intro to Imported Libraries and other Functions ==

:In this chapter, we will cover some functions from various imported libraries that are commonly asked about, or used in Python. This chapter is not required to fully understand basics of Python. This chapter is meant to show further capability of Python, which can be utilized with what you already know about the language.

=== math ===

:The math library has many functions that are useful for programs that need to perform mathematical operations, that cannot be accomplished using the built in operators.

:This section assumes you have math training up to and including Trigonometry.

The following list, shows all the functions in the math library:
*math.ceil
*math.copysign
*math.fabs
*math.factorial
*math.floor
*math.fmod (Not the most ideal for it's purpose. Will not be explained.)
*math.frexp (Outside the scope of this tutorial. Will not be explained.)
*math.fsum
*math.isfinite
*math.isinf
*math.isnan
*math.ldexp
*math.modf  (Outside the realm of this tutorial. Will not be explained.)
*math.trunc (Outside the realm of this tutorial. Will not be explained.)
*math.exp
*math.expm1
*math.log
*math.log1p
*math.log10
*math.pow
*math.sqrt
*math.acos
*math.asin
*math.atan
*math.atan2
*math.cos
*math.hypot
*math.sin
*math.tan
*math.degrees
*math.radians
*math.acosh
*math.asinh
*math.atanh
*math.cosh
*math.sinh
*math.tanh
*math.erf
*math.erfc
*math.gamma
*math.lgamma
*math.pi
*math.e

:Of course we wont cover every one of these functions. But we will cover a good chunk of them.

Lets start off by covering the two constants in the math library. &lt;code&gt;math.pi&lt;/code&gt; is the mathematical constant &quot;π&quot;, to available precision on your computer. &lt;code&gt;math.e&lt;/code&gt; is the mathematical constant &quot;e&quot;, to available precision on your computer.
Here is an example of both constants when entered in interactive mode in the Python shell.
 &gt;&gt;&gt;math.e
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;2.718281828459045&lt;/font&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt;math.pi
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;3.141592653589793&lt;/font&gt;

These constants can be stored in a variable just like any other number. Below is an example of such, and shows simple operations on those variables.
 &gt;&gt;&gt; conste = math.e
 &gt;&gt;&gt; (conste + 5 / 2) * 2.21
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;11.532402840894488&lt;/font&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; constpi = math.pi
 &gt;&gt;&gt; (((7 /2.1) % constpi) * 2)
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;0.38348135948707984&lt;/font&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt;

Now, lets look at the functions. Lets start at the top of the list, and work our way down. Some of the functions will be skipped.
At this point in the tutorial, you should be able to look at each of these examples to follow, and easily figure out what the example does. A simple sentence or two about what the function does will be provided.

Below is an example of every &lt;code&gt;math&lt;/code&gt; module function, and how it is used. (Excluding functions noted above as not to be explained)

 &gt;&gt;&gt; import math
 &gt;&gt;&gt; math.ceil(4.5) ** Rounds the number up to the nearest non decimal number **
 5
 &gt;&gt;&gt; math.ceil(4.1)
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;5&lt;/font&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; math.copysign(4, -.4)  ** Returns the number &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; with the sign of &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; in the context of &lt;code&gt;(x,y)&lt;/code&gt;
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;-4.0&lt;/font&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; math.copysign(-4, 4)
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;4.0&lt;/font&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; math.fabs(-44)  ** Return the absolute value of the number **
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;44.0&lt;/font&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; math.factorial(4)  **  Returns the factorial of a number **
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;24&lt;/font&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; math.floor(4.3)  ** Rounds the number down to the nearest non decimal number. **
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; math.floor(4.99999)
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;4&lt;/font&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; math.fsum([.1,.2,5,45.2,-.054,.4]) **  Returns the sum of all the numbers in the brackets. Not always precise **
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;50.846000000000004&lt;/font&gt;
 &gt;&gt;&gt; math.isfinite(3)&lt;/font&gt; ** Returns &lt;code&gt;True&lt;/code&gt; if the value is infinity or NaN. Returns &lt;code&gt;False&lt;/code&gt; otherwise. **
 &lt;font color=&quot;blue&quot;&gt;True&lt;/font&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">So here we are at the end, or maybe the beginning.  This tutorial is on Wikibooks, so feel free to make improvements to it. If you want to learn more about Python, [http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html The Python Tutorial] by [http://www.python.org/~guido/ Guido van Rossum] has more topics that you can learn about.   If you have been following this tutorial, you should be able to understand a fair amount of it.  The [[Python Programming]] wikibook can be worth looking at, too.  Here are few other books which cover Python 3:

* [http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python A Byte of Python by Swaroop C H]
* [http://anh.cs.luc.edu/python/hands-on/3.1/handsonHtml/index.html Hands-on Python Tutorial by Dr. Andrew N. Harrington] 
* [[Subject:Python programming language]] lists other Wikibooks related to Python.

Hopefully this book covers everything you have needed to get started programming.  Thanks to everyone who has sent me emails about it.  I enjoyed reading them, even when I have not always been the best replier.  

Happy programming, may it change your life and the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve">; How do I make a GUI in Python? : You can use either TKinter at http://www.python.org/topics/tkinter/ or PyQT4 at http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/  or PyGobject at http://live.gnome.org/PyGObject For really simple graphics, you can use the turtle graphics mode &lt;code&gt;import turtle&lt;/code&gt;
; How do I make a game in Python? : The best method is probably to use PyGame at http://pygame.org/
; How do I make an executable from a Python program? : Short answer: Python is an interepreted language so that is impossible. Long answer is that something similar to an executable can be created by taking the Python interpreter and the file and joining them together and distributing that.  For more on that problem see http://www.python.org/doc/faq/programming/#how-can-i-create-a-stand-alone-binary-from-a-python-script
; (IFAQ) Why do you use first person in this tutorial? : Once upon a time in a different millenia, (1999 to be exact), an earlier version was written entirely by Josh Cogliati, and it was up on his webpage http://www.honors.montana.edu/~jjc/easytut and it was good.  Then the server rupert, like all good things than have a beginning came to an end, and Josh moved it to Wikibooks, but the first person writing stuck.  If someone really wants to change it, I will not revert it, but I don't see much point.   
; My question is not answered. : Ask on the discussion page or add it to this FAQ, or email one of the [[../Authors|Authors]].  

For other FAQs, you may want to see the Python 2.6 version of this page [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 2.6/FAQ]], or the [http://www.python.org/doc/faq/ Python FAQ].

      <text xml:space="preserve">EXERCISE AND LIVING WITH CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME (CFS)
----
The association between Chronic Fatigue and Exercise allows an individuals inner strength to be truly revealed.







====WHAT IS CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME?====

=====Definition=====

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is an “illness characterised by fatigue that occurs suddenly, improves and relapses. Bringing on delimitating tiredness or easy fatiguability in an individual who has no apparent reason for feeling this way’.’’ 
=====Clinical Diagnosis=====

“Cases of unexplained Chronic Fatigue can be defined if they meet both of the following criteria:

1. Clinically evaluated, unexplained persistent or relapsing chronic fatigue of new or definite onset that:

** Is not the result of ongoing exertion;
** Is not substantially alleviated by stress; and
** Results in substantial reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social or personal activities; and

2. The concurrent occurrence of four or more of the following symptoms:

** Substantial impairment in short-term memory or concentration; 
** Sore throat;
** Tender lymph nodes;
** Muscle pain; 
** Multi-joint pain without swelling or redness; 
** Headaches of a new type;
** Sleep that is not refreshing.

These symptoms must have persisted or recurred during six or more consecutive months of illness and must have predated the fatigue”.

&lt;ref&gt;ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities&lt;/ref&gt;

===CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME AND EXERCISE===

It is of general knowledge that exercise proves to be a crucial ingredient in leading a healthy lifestyle and improves an individuals quality of life. Yet when debilitating fatigue strikes that affects all major bodily organs, the choice of eliminating physical activity from daily life proves to be a simple and common one. Research indicates that this is indeed the wrong choice and that physical activity should be both encouraged and completed despite symptoms such as headaches, balance and proprioception issues and bodily aches. This was proven by Sharpe and Wessely (1998) who stated that: “Graded exercise has shown effectiveness in CFS. Treatment should be gradual starting at a low level of exercise and increasing incrementally under controlled conditions”.

[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1297043/pdf/jrsocmed00013-0053.pdf Sharpe and Wessley (1998).]

====Relationship Complexity====

An underlying issue that exists between Chronic Fatigue and Exercise lies in the patients attitude and support systems. It has been noted that positive affects result when the individual feels supported by family members and peers, despite these people not fully understanding the severity of this persons illness nor the pain and frustration they feel. These psychological and emotional battles reinforce the need for regular physical activity to act as a stress reliever and distraction. 

A strong correlation exists between exercise and post-exertional dizziness via the vestibular system, this places a greater need upon the completion of exercise at intensities and frequencies that is at the participants discretion. The implementation and adherence to a graded exercise regime would prove to be the most beneficial. The monitoring of an individuals symptoms and their personal recording of their symptoms/general feeling is encouraged.

====Exercise Prescription for a CFS Patient====

The creation of an exercise regime for an individual with Chronic Fatigue should be based upon their daily symptoms. The major focus is upon getting the individual moving, despite the severity of symptoms. Exercise prescription should focus upon the functional capacity of the individual, including flexibility training and graded exercise therapy. The “monitoring of standard cardiovascular and ventilatory responses, (electrocardiogram, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory gas exchange and ventilation)” would be most suitable, in correspondence with the rate of perceived exertion.

====Treatment Options====

With no formal prescription medicine available for sufferers this only increases the importance of focussing upon the reduction in frequency and intensity of symptoms. Many sufferers utilise medications such as “tricyclic agents, antidepressants, anxiolytic agents, anti-inflammatory agents and antihistamines” to deal with their symptoms. Some take a holistic approach to healing and focus upon diet and nutritional changes, herbal options, massage and chiropractic therapy and aromatherapy. Yet coping mechanisms such as stress management plans should continue to be individualised, dependant upon severity and at the individuals discretion.

&lt;ref&gt;ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities&lt;/ref&gt;

==RECOMMENDATIONS==
* Attention should be placed upon how the individual perceives their symptoms upon a daily basis, this should be recorded. 
* Complete exercise at an incremental pace - despite feelings of frustration and worthlessness,  be patient!
* The individual should seek support, from family or friends or via online groups such as the ‘Toby Morrison - Health and Lifestyle’ Facebook page. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/tobymorrisoncfs?fref=ts&lt;/ref&gt;
* Focus upon increasing sleep, taking regular breaks to avoid crashing, nutrition, water intake, stress management and engaging in things that make the sufferer happy.

'''Main article: ''[[Trainz/references/texture.txt file]]''''' (This page should be merged-to if more detailed, and otherwise rewritten as primer and introduction, both ''(and firstly)'' for error fixing and then for simpler forms of content creation.
{{leftBox|1= 
'''Scope:''' This guideline applies to each of the following Trainz {{wp|data type|type specifications}}:
:''{{TR2|KD|KIND Texture}}, {{TR2|KD|KIND Groundtexture}}, {{TR2|A|Alpha_masking|Alpha masking}}, {{TR2|A|.texture.txt_Files|Miscellaneous.texture.txt Files}}, and the {{TRC|thumbnails container}}''.

:''Related data types: {{N3V|&quot;Texture-variants&quot;_container|&quot;Texture-variants&quot; container}}'' (asset provides alternative material configurations for the texture to display as seasonal variants.)}}
&amp;nbsp;

==Description==
Trainz '''Texture files''' are ASCII text format specification files describing a single texture (per N3V's article names{{efn|The TrainzOnline wiki has both the titles 'Texture File' and 'texure.txt file' as topic titles, and an edit made by Chief programmer Chris Bergman indicates he'd prefer the two pages be merged. In truth, the information in both is pretty much identical, so we replicate it herein on the {{TR|x|texture.txt file}} page and just note the dual location of source 'authority' exists, and has done so for a very long time.}}) '''or''' in common usage, a Trainzer might be referring to the graphics formatted files such a {{TR|x|texture.txt file}} controls. These texture.txt files are not the compressed {{TR|x|.texture files}} which are binary generated as described below, but like the graphics texture images, become one component of a pair of files forcibly married and compacted in a Auran format, the resultant ''''.texture file'''' which is constructed by {{TL|CM}} when the asset is committed. These are sometimes visible when the asset is opened, especially when it is a'' new clone''. 
{{TrainzTip|BG=white|CO=blue|1=
Texture files have a &quot;&lt;b&gt;.texture.txt&lt;/b&gt;&quot; name &lt;u&gt;extension&lt;/u&gt;, however when a texture file is specified within a {{TA|config.txt file}}, the &quot;.txt&quot; must be omitted, leaving just the &quot;.texture&quot; extension in the tag data value field. (This looks odd and seems counter-intuitive, but to Trainz, ''''''.texture'''''' implies ''''''.texture.txt'''''', and the latter form (which is the Operating System format) is understood ''when CM manipulates the data'', but is not when TrainzUtil, Driver, Railyard, or Surveyor ''use the &lt;u&gt;committed&lt;/u&gt; and processed &lt;u&gt;ready to use&lt;/u&gt; data''. ({{TA|TrainzUtil}} is a background process which does many data base operations commanded by the other Trainz modules.)}}
&amp;nbsp;
Files with '''*.texture.txt''' suffix and extension are used to configure texture behavior in Trainz. These files may also control how textures are processed by {{TA|Content Manager}}.  These files are located in the same folder as the source texture files, '''typically .bmp, .tga or .jpg files''' (and .png's in {{TL|TANE}}), and make 'pathspec connection' reference to them. Fixing these pathspecs is often the only tweak a faulty asset requires, as after {{TL|TS09}}, more stringent file references were demanded by the software. These texture.txt files are generated automatically by the respective 3D graphics software exporter or importer utilities from the CC's asset source folders but may be edited by hand when ''specialization of effects they control'' is required&amp;mdash;which is an occasional need in repairing faulty content.

==File format==

The user-editable {{TL|texture.txt file|*.texture.txt files}} are ASCII text formatted key-value pairs with the following options. Please note that this format is not the same (despite some similarities) as other text-based formats used by Trainz. Please be aware of the {{TL|filename character restrictions}} when naming texture and image files.

;Syntax
Each token is specified on a new line. There is no white space on either side of the '=' sign. A empty value is sometimes valid. The syntax is:

 &lt;token&gt;=&lt;value&gt;

;Example:
 Primary=WayCoolTexture.tga
 Alpha=WayCoolTexture.tga
 Tile=st
 AlphaHint=masked
 Anisotropy=16
 MagFilter=linear
 MinFilter=linear
 MipFilter=linear
''(Example only, not recommended settings)''


===Tokens and Values===

 Primary=diffusemap.bmp

This tag specifies the filename of the image file representing the color (R, G, B) channels of the texture. Any alpha channel in the image file is ignored. The resultant texture will have a pure white (100%) alpha channel.

===Primary, diff Alpha===
 Primary=diffusemap.jpg
 Alpha=diffusemap.bmp

This tag combination specifies the filenames of the image file representing the color (R, G, B) channels of the texture and the image file representing the alpha (A) channel of the texture. The alpha channel image should be grayscale. Neither file should contain an alpha channel.

===Primary, same Alpha===
 Primary=diffusemap.tga
 Alpha=diffusemap.tga

This tag combination specifies the filename of a single image file representing the color and alpha (R, G, B, A) channels of the texture. In this case both tags must reference the same filename. The image file must contain an alpha channel.

===Compression===
 Compression=dxt1

This tag forces the usage of a particular texture compression scheme. If omitted, Trainz will choose an appropriate texture compression scheme based on the contents of the supplied image files. If you don't have a specific effect in mind, don't include this tag. Valid options are 'none', 'dxt1', 'dxt3', 'dxt5'. Refer {{TA|DXT Compression}}. 

===NormalMapHint===
 NormalMapHint=normalmap

The 'NormalMapHint' tag allows the texture to be specified as a {{TA|normal map}}. By default, Trainz will assume that your texture is a {{TA|diffuse map}} and will apply some processing options which are not appropriate for normal maps. You must specify this option for normal maps. Valid options are 'none' and 'normalmap'.

===ModifyMap===
 ModifyMap=flipgreen

The 'ModifyMap' option allows a texture's green color channel to be flipped.  Some programs such as 3ds Max create {{TA|normal map}}s with the Y axis facing the opposite way to what is expected by the Trainz shaders.  This option can be used to make the bump effect look correct in Trainz. The option is applied by the {{TA|Content Manager}} upon Commit. Valid options are 'none' and 'flipgreen'.

===AlphaHint===
 AlphaHint=opaque

The 'AlphaHint' tag allows you to force a particular alpha mode on the texture. Valid options are 'opaque' (meaning that the alpha channel is unused and effectively pure white), 'semitransparent' (meaning that the alpha channel is a grayscale blend) and 'masked' (meaning that the alpha channel is a pure black&amp;white bitmap.) If omitted, Trainz will supply an appropriate value for this tag based on the Alpha channel. Specifying this option prevents slight discoloration in a mask texture from triggering the blended alpha path.

===Anisotropy===
 Anisotropy=1

Anisotropic sampling quality.  The higher the number, the better the visual quality but at significant performance cost. Where texture quality is needed specify a higher value. Trainz currently defaults to Very High anisotropic filtering, which is then subsequently restricted by the in-game Anisotropy slider.  Valid values are integers
&quot;1&quot; (default) - No anisotropic filtering, &quot;2&quot; - Low, &quot;4&quot; - Medium, &quot;8&quot; - High, and &quot;16&quot; - Very High

===MagFilter===
 MagFilter=linear

Controls the filtering style for texel magnification. This is used when a texel is displayed at larger than real size (eg. a single texel is represented with more than a single pixel.) Valid settings for the magnification filter are 'nearest', 'linear', and 'default'. Trainz currently defaults to linear interpolation. Selecting 'nearest' will use a nearest-neighbor filtering mode which results in a &quot;pixelated&quot; output.
 
===MinFilter===
 MinFilter=linear

Controls the filtering style for texel minification. This is used when a texel is displayed at smaller than real size (eg. a single pixel is represented with more than a single texel.) Valid settings for the minification filter are 'nearest', 'linear', and 'default'. Trainz currently defaults to linear interpolation. Selecting 'nearest' will use a quantized filtering mode which results in a &quot;noisy&quot; output.

===MipFilter===
 MipFilter=linear

Controls the filtering style for texture mipmap selection. Mipmaps are used during minification to help prevent the moire effect pattern. The cost of using mipmaps is that the resultant image will blur slightly. The benefits of using mipmaps are reduced quantization noise and reduced memory footprint (since the higher detail mip levels can be unloaded when not in use.) Valid settings for the mip filter are 'nearest', 'linear', 'default' and 'none'. Trainz currently defaults to trilinear interpolation. Selecting 'nearest' will cause the hardware to select a single mipmap for each pixel, which results in visible banding at mipmap boundaries. Selecting 'none' will disable mipmaps, resulting in lower performance, higher memory usage, and &quot;noisy&quot; output.


 Tile=st

Tiling refers to the ability for texture coordinates outside the range of (0.0 .. 1.0) to be treated as valid coordinates on an infinitely tiled texture. With tiling active, coordinates which pass the right/bottom side of the texture effectively wrap back onto the left/top side, and so on. Valid options include 's' (tile horizontally), 't' (tile vertically), 'st' (tile both horizontally and vertically), and 'none' (do not tile the image).


==Comments &amp; Suggestions==
The token ''Hint'' is intended for internal use only, but has been used and abused by well meaning people since its discovery.  ''Anisotropy'' should be used to improve texture quality, and ''MipFilter=none'' should be used to disable mip mapping only for ''interface textures''.


==Image formats==
The following image formats are acceptable as source data for the Texture file:

* Targa (.tga) files. Targa is a lossless image format with optional compression and optional alpha channel.
* JPEG (.jpg) files. JPEG is a lossy image compression format with no alpha channel support.
* Windows Bitmap (.bmp) files. BMP is a lossless image format with no compression and optional alpha channel.

These images in association with the appropriate *.texture.txt file are used by {{TA|Content Manager}} to create the Auran/N3V ''binary textures'' ({{col|*.texture files, no other extension!|blue}}) that are used in the Trainz simulators. The N3V binary textures use {{TR2|A|DXT Compression}} and {{col|contain image LOD information|blue}}.

* All built-in content has only N3V binary textures that cannot be opened with normal imaging software.  Appropriate tools to view these can be found on the {{TR2|L|Tools}} page.

Any image larger than 2048x2048 will be resized to that maximum, so there is no point in using images larger than that in the asset. It is preferable to resize your images using your preferred resampling option in your favorite image editing program than to allow {{TA|Content Manager}} to resize the image. In practice, images should be no larger than needed to provide the appropriate level of detail at the closest typical viewing distance. Uniform-color images should be as small as possible - certainly no larger than 16x16.

==Notes on Image Editors==
* The Targa Exporter plugin shipped with some older versions of Adobe Photoshop is broken and silently corrupts or discards alpha channels; a free update is available which resolves this issue.
* Some image editors do not support alpha channels on BMP files.


==.txt file extension==
Texture files have a &quot;.texture.txt&quot; name extension, however when a texture file is specified within a {{TA|config.txt file}} or similar, the &quot;.txt&quot; must be omitted, leaving the &quot;.texture&quot; extension.
For example, a texture file named ''grass.texture.txt'' is specified in a {{TR|KD|KIND Groundtexture}} config file using the syntax ''texture &quot;grass.texture&quot;''.

==Use of image files in place of texture files==
Trainz has historically supported using ''any supported image file'' type in place of a {{TA|Texture file}}. This technique has obvious limitations and &lt;code&gt;is no longer recommended.&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;!-- HIGHLIGHTS --&gt;
'''Vietnamese Fish Sauce''' is a sauce prepared for used at the table.  

It uses a more concentrated fish sauce of a similar name.

==Ingredients==
*0.25	cups	Nước Mắm (concentrated fish sauce)
*1.5	cups	Water
*1	TBS	Lemon Juice
*1	TBS	Sugar
*1	tsp	Garlic, very finely chopped, or about 2 cloves pressed through a garlic press
*0.5	tsp	[[w:Sambal|Sambal]] Oelek (a type of hot chile sauce)

==Procedure==
#Mix all ingredients.  
#Optional: Bring to a boil that can not be stirred down. 
#Cover and refrigerate.

==Notes, Tips &amp; Variations==
*In restaurants it is served in small bowls, one for each diner, often with a bit of julienned carrot on top. It is sometimes served with rolls of various types (Summer rolls, Spring rolls, Imperial rolls, etc.) and is usually available in Vietnamese restaurants upon request.  
*For home use, I prefer to store it in a squirt bottle, and prefer to grind up the Sambal Oelek and garlic to a smaller size using a mortar and pestle so that they do not clog the nozzle.
*You may find the smell quite strong in making this, especially if you decide to boil. Persevere.
*The Three Crabs Brand of concentrated fish sauce is universally praised.  There are many, many other brands.

&lt;small&gt;Below, the template with typesetters test text:&lt;/small&gt;
{{LeftBox|{{Lorem}}}}
* &lt;small&gt;''Adapted from {{Tl|TextBox}} for more user friendly style and inline notations. {{Tl|TextBox-L}} aliases this page (A template redirect).''&lt;/small&gt;
&amp;nbsp;

;usage

* '''image''' (optional) : the image to be used.
:*The &lt;code&gt;| size= &lt;/code&gt; option may be given to override the default 25x25px size.
:* The &lt;code&gt;| IVA= &lt;/code&gt; option may be given to change HTML/CSS {{Col|vertical-align:top|blue}} to middle or bottom for the image in it's leftside box. The default is ''''top'''' so it floats up against the overall padding of the surrounding box.

Calculus of variations is a method for proving existence and uniqueness results for certain equations; in particular, it can be applied to some partial differential equations. The method works as follows: Let's say we have an equation which is to be solved for the variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (this variable can also be a function). We look for a function whose minimizers satisfy the equation, and then prove that there exists a minimizer. We have thus obtained an existence result.

In some cases, we will additionally be able to show that values &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the equation are minimizers of the function. If we now find out about the number of minimizers of the function, we will also know the numbers of solutions to the equation. If then the function has only one minimizer, we have obtained a uniqueness result.

Sometimes, calculus of variations also works ‘the other way round’: We have a function whose minimizers are difficult to find. Then we show that the minimizers of this function are exactly the solutions of a partial differential equation, which is easy to solve. Thus, we solve the partial differential equation and obtain the minimizers of the function.

== Strong convexity ==

== &quot;Normal&quot; equations ==
Consider the equation system
:&lt;math&gt;(*)\begin{cases}
f_1(x) &amp;= 0 \\
f_2(x) &amp;= 0 \\
~~~~\vdots \\
f_d(x) &amp;= 0 \\
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
for functions &lt;math&gt;f_n : \mathbb R^d \to \mathbb R, n \in \{1, \ldots, d\}&lt;/math&gt;. If there exists a function &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal C^1(\mathbb R^d)&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f =\begin{pmatrix} f_1 \\ f_2 \\ \vdots \\ f_d \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
we find that the equation system &lt;math&gt;(*)&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f (x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the right conditions, we have &lt;math&gt;\nabla f (x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; at exactly one point &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb R^d&lt;/math&gt;:

{{TextBox| M=0 | W=100% | BG=#FFFFFF |1='''Definition 13.1''':

Let &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal C^2(\mathbb R^d)&lt;/math&gt;, and let's denote the Hessian matrix of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;H_f (x)&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called '''strongly convex''' iff
:&lt;math&gt;\exists c &gt; 0 : \forall x \in \mathbb R^d, \mathbf v \in \mathbb R^d : \mathbf v^T H_f (x) \mathbf v \ge c \| \mathbf v \|^2&lt;/math&gt;}}

{{TextBox| M=0 | W=100% | BG=#FFFFFF |1='''Theorem 13.2''':

Let &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal C^2(\mathbb R^d)&lt;/math&gt; be strongly convex. Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; has exactly one critical point (i. e. a point &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb R^d&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;).}}

'''Proof''':

From &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; being strongly convex it follows that for all &lt;math&gt;x \in \mathbb R^d&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H_f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is positively definite. Therefore, every critical point is a local minimum (this is due to the sufficient condition for local minima). Thus, it suffices to prove that there is exactly one local minimum.

1.

We show that there exists a local minimum.

We take Taylor's formula around &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \in \mathbb R^d : \exists \lambda \in [0, 1] : f(x) = f(0) + x^T \nabla f(0) + \frac{1}{2} x^T H_f(\lambda x) x&lt;/math&gt;
Thus,
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\forall x \in \mathbb R^d : f(x) &amp; = f(0) + x^T \nabla f(0) + \frac{1}{2} x^T H_f(\lambda x) x &amp; \text{ for a } \lambda \in [0, 1] \\
&amp; \ge f(0) + x^T \nabla f(0) + \frac{c}{2} \| x \|^2 &amp; f \text{ is strongly convex} \\
&amp; \ge f(0) - \|x\| \|\nabla f(0)\| + \frac{c}{2} \| x \|^2 &amp; \text{Cauchy-Schwarz inequality}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
for a &lt;math&gt;c \in \mathbb R_{&gt;0}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, there exists an &lt;math&gt;R \in \mathbb R_{&gt;0}&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\forall x \notin B_R(0) : f(x) &gt; f(0) ~~~~~ (**)&lt;/math&gt;
By the extreme value theorem, there exists a minimum &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\overline{B_R(0)}&lt;/math&gt;. It can not be attained on the border, because if &lt;math&gt;f(y) \in \partial B_R(0)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;y \notin B_R(0)&lt;/math&gt; and thus by &lt;math&gt;(**)&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;f(y) &gt; f(0)&lt;/math&gt;, which would imply that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is not a minimum. Therefore it is attained in the interior and is thus a local minimum. In fact, from &lt;math&gt;(**)&lt;/math&gt; and from &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; being a minimum on &lt;math&gt;\overline{B_R(0)}&lt;/math&gt; even follows that it is a global minimum of &lt;math&gt;f: \mathbb R^d \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.

2.

We show that there is only one local minimum.

Let &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; be two local minima. We show that &lt;math&gt;y = x&lt;/math&gt;, thereby excluding the possibility of two different minima. We define a function &lt;math&gt;\mu: \mathbb R \to \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt; as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;\mu(\xi) := f(\xi y + (1 - \xi) x)&lt;/math&gt;
Let's calculate the first and second derivative of &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\mu'(\xi) &amp; = \begin{pmatrix} \partial_{x_1} f(\xi y + (1 - \xi) x) &amp; \cdots &amp; \partial_{x_d} f(\xi y + (1 - \xi) x) \end{pmatrix} (y - x) &amp; \text{ multi-dimensional chain rule} \\
&amp; = \sum_{k=1}^d \partial_{x_k} f(\xi y + (1 - \xi) x) (y_k - x_k) &amp; \\
\mu''(\xi) &amp; = \sum_{k=1}^d \begin{pmatrix} \partial_{x_1} \partial_{x_k} f(\xi y + (1 - \xi) x) &amp; \cdots &amp; \partial_{x_d} \partial_{x_k} f(\xi y + (1 - \xi) x) \end{pmatrix} (y - x) &amp; \text{ multi-dimensional chain rule} \\
&amp; = (y - x)^T H_f (\xi y + (1 - \xi) x) (y - x) &amp;
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; are local minima, &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\nabla f(y) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore,
:&lt;math&gt;\mu'(0) = \nabla f(x) \cdot (y - x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\mu'(1) = \nabla f(y) \cdot (y - x) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, by the mean value theorem, there exists a &lt;math&gt;\lambda \in (0, 1)&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt;\mu''(\lambda) = 0&lt;/math&gt;
But since
:&lt;math&gt;\mu''(\lambda) = (y - x)^T H_f (\lambda y + (1 - \lambda) x) (y - x) \overset{\text{strong convexity of } f}{\ge} c \|y - x\|^2&lt;/math&gt;
, &lt;math&gt;\mu''(\lambda) = 0&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;.{{QED}}

{{TextBox| M=0 | W=100% | BG=#FFFFFF |1='''Corollary 13.3''':

Suppose we have an equation system
:&lt;math&gt;(*)\begin{cases}
f_1(x) &amp;= 0 \\
f_2(x) &amp;= 0 \\
~~~~\vdots \\
f_d(x) &amp;= 0 \\
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
If there is a function &lt;math&gt;f \in \mathcal C^2(\mathbb R^d)&lt;/math&gt; which is strongly convex and
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla f =\begin{pmatrix} f_1 \\ f_2 \\ \vdots \\ f_d \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
, then the equation system &lt;math&gt;(*)&lt;/math&gt; has exactly one solution.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to check your XML document against a set of business rules.  These rules may be more complex then a single pass XML Schema can perform.

== Overview ==
[http://www.schematron.com Schematron] provides a different approach to validation than a standard Schema. Rather than stating the correct form of a document, Schematron allows you to define rules which can be applied as needed.  You can also specify rules in one part of a document that reference other parts of the document using XPath expressions.   This is very useful when a document is created in stages and specific business rules need to be checked prior to using the data.

Schematron may also work along side of traditional XML Schemas.  You can use XML Schemas to check the overall document structure and data types and use Schematron to express rules that can be done best with XPath rules.

Schematron is also ideal because it allows the rule designer to specify the exact error messages for rules.  XML Schema error messages are often not easy for users to understand.

== Example ==
Here's an example: prior to sending a confirmation email for a &quot;school-booking&quot;, the booking must contain a school/id, a Teacher's email-address, and a Date for the booking. The Date must be in the future.

&lt;source lang='xml'&gt;
   let $schema := 
   &lt;sch:schema xmlns:sch=&quot;http://purl.oclc.org/dsdl/schematron&quot; queryBinding=&quot;xslt2&quot;&gt;
     &lt;sch:title&gt;School-booking Prior to Send-by-email&lt;/sch:title&gt;
     &lt;sch:pattern id=&quot;Send-email-check&quot;&gt;
         &lt;sch:rule context=&quot;school/id&quot;&gt;
             &lt;sch:assert test=&quot;. ne ''&quot;&gt;Missing School ID&lt;/sch:assert&gt;
         &lt;/sch:rule&gt;
         &lt;sch:rule context=&quot;school/teacher-email&quot;&gt;
             &lt;sch:assert test=&quot;. ne ''&quot;&gt;Missing Teach-Email&lt;/sch:assert&gt;
         &lt;/sch:rule&gt;
         &lt;sch:rule context=&quot;day&quot;&gt;
             &lt;sch:assert test=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Missing booking Date&lt;/sch:assert&gt;
         &lt;/sch:rule&gt;
         &lt;sch:rule context=&quot;day/date&quot;&gt;
             &lt;sch:assert test=&quot;. castable as xs:date and xs:date(.) gt current-date()&quot;&gt;The Date must be in the future&lt;/sch:assert&gt;
         &lt;/sch:rule&gt;
     &lt;/sch:pattern&gt;
   &lt;/sch:schema&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

To apply this schema from an XQuery:
&lt;source lang='xml'&gt;
  xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;
   let $send-email-validator := 
      transform:transform(
         $schema,
         xs:anyURI(&quot;xmldb:///db/iso-schematron-xslt2/iso_svrl_for_xslt2.xsl&quot;),() )
   return transform:transform(
      $the-data,
      $send-email-validator,() )
&lt;/source&gt;

And the results (edited for clarity):
&lt;source lang='xml'&gt;
   &lt;schematron-output  title=&quot;School-booking Prior to Send-by-email&quot; &gt;
     &lt;failed-assert test=&quot;. ne ''&quot; location=&quot;/school-booking[1]/school[1]/teacher-email[1]&quot;&gt;
        &lt;text&gt;Missing Teach-Email&lt;/svrl:text&gt;
     &lt;/failed-assert&gt;
     &lt;failed-assert test=&quot;. castable as xs:date and xs:date(.) gt current-date()&quot; location=&quot;/school-booking[1]/day[1]/date[1]&quot;&gt;
        &lt;text&gt;The Date must be in the future&lt;/svrl:text&gt;
     &lt;/failed-assert&gt;
   &lt;/schematron-output&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The results can be used to highlight the error and display a message to the user.

== Setup in eXist-db ==
I've chosen the XSLT 2.0 version of the Schematron validation - so eXist-db needs to have Saxon 9 installed. (...)

# Get the [http://www.schematron.com/implementation.html iso-schematron-xslt2] and upload the (unzipped) contents to your database.
# Create a schema in the db
# Compile and run the schema on your data

== XQuery Module for ISO Schematron ==
Jing only supports Schematron 1.5.  A more advanced version of Schematron is the ISO Schematron, which Jing will not run.
To get this to work you must &quot;compile&quot; your Schematron rules using XSLT.

The following is a sample XQuery module that does this compilation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
module namespace v=&quot;http://gspring.com.au/pekoe/validator&quot;;

declare variable $v:schematron-compiler := xs:anyURI(&quot;xmldb:///db/iso-schematron-xslt2/iso_svrl_for_xslt2.xsl&quot;);

(: Call like this: v:validate($xml, xs:anyURI(&quot;/db/path/to/schema.sch&quot;) ) :)

declare function v:validate($doc as node(), $schematron as xs:anyURI ) {
    let $validator := local:get-compiled-validator($schematron)
    return transform:transform(
        $doc,
        $validator,()
        )
};

 declare function local:get-compiled-validator($schematron-path as xs:anyURI) {
    let $s-path := xs:string($schematron-path)
    let $xsl-path := concat(substring-before($s-path,&quot;.&quot;),&quot;.xsl&quot;)
    return  (: check that the compiled version is up-to-date :)
        if (exists(doc($xsl-path)) and 
            xmldb:last-modified(util:collection-name($xsl-path), util:document-name($xsl-path)) gt 
            xmldb:last-modified(util:collection-name($s-path), util:document-name($s-path))) 
        then doc($xsl-path) 
        else local:compile-schematron($s-path,$xsl-path)
 };
 
 declare function local:compile-schematron($schematron-path, $xsl-path) {
    let $compiled := transform:transform(
                    doc($schematron-path), 
                    $v:schematron-compiler, ())
    let $stored := xmldb:store(util:collection-name($schematron-path), $xsl-path, $compiled)
    return doc($stored)
 };
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the xslt assumes an include file.

|+&lt;h2&gt; Grammar&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Guided Practice: Informal Future Explained&lt;/h2&gt;
In this section we will discuss the structure of informal future.  &lt;br&gt;
In English, informal future is constructed with &quot;___going to + verb&quot; &lt;br&gt;
In Spanish, this is nearly identical in grammatical makeup with &quot;___ir  a + verbo&quot;&lt;br&gt;

|+&lt;h2&gt; Grammar&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Guided Practice: Formal Future Explained&lt;/h2&gt;
Here, we will learn about the formations for formal future. &lt;br&gt;
Formal future uses the conjugation method that integrates the subject with the verb, these are different &lt;br&gt; depending on whether the verb ends in -ir, -er, or -ar.  &lt;br&gt; To form the future tense, you keep the entire form of the infinitive verb, and add an ending for the appropriate subject.  See the following charts for examples.

{| class = &quot;wikitable&quot; width=&quot;85%&quot; border=1 align= &quot;center&quot;
|  -AR Verbs

      <comment>/* Foods that contain Gluten */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Wheat ear.jpg|thumb|Wheat ear]]
==&lt;big&gt;'''Information on this page'''&lt;/big&gt;==
&lt;big&gt;This page is intended to give some basic information on gluten including what it is, who it can affect, the effects on the body, some sources of gluten and ideas on preventing cross-contamination. The information is directed at professional and amateur chefs or anyone interested in aspects of gluten .&lt;/big&gt;

==''What is Gluten''?==
Gluten is a complex molecule made up to two separate proteins – glutenin and gliadin , each make up half of the total gluten molecule.

===Gliadin===
Gliadin proteins are what makes bread dough’s thick, viscous making and harder to work and move around. The longer you work a dough the tougher it will get as this protein will attach to starch and other components in the dough.

===Glutenin===
The glutenin proteins are the part that holds all the components of the flour together like the starch, fat and from any ingredients placed in such as milk or eggs for example. These proteins are also responsible for giving the dough strength and elastic properties.

==''Who does this affect and what does it do to the body?''==
[[File:Stomach colon rectum diagram.svg|thumb|The path of digestion]]
This can affect people suffering from coeliac disease. This disease affects around 1 in 80 males and 1 in 60 females in Australia.

Coeliac disease is where the immune system reacts abnormally to gluten which causes damage to the little hair like projections in the small intestine called villi that allow people to absorb nutrients. 
When the gluten protein comes into contact with these villi they become inflamed and flatten out which can cause intestinal symptoms in some people with coeliac disease,  but this is not true for all sufferers.
Some people that have coeliac disease but remain undiagnosed can continue to eat gluten with no symptoms at all but will still cause damage to the villi in the small intestine.

In terms of cross contamination all it can take to start this inflammation process is as little as 100th of a bread slice which is about the size of a finger nail or 1/3 of a teaspoon.

==''Foods that contain Gluten''==
===The usual suspects===
[[File:Gluten Sources.png|thumb|Gluten Sources -Top: High-gluten wheat flour. Right: European spelt. Bottom: Barley. Left: Rolled rye flakes.]]
Easy to spot grains that contain gluten can include:
* Wheat
* Barley 
* Rye
* Spelt 
* Any products that use these like pastas, breads, cakes, pastries and muffins.

===The not so obvious===
Then there's other grains that are not recognized as easily that may be encountered in the kitchen, these include:
* '''Triticale''' - A hybrid grain with a cross of wheat and rye using properties of both and looking very similar.[[File:Triticale-aehren.jpg|thumb|Triticale]]

* '''Khorasan wheat''' - Also known as oriental wheat and grows in the Middle east area around Afghanistan and Iran. This grain has less gluten in it than the others but still contains enough to cause damage.[[File:Kamut grain.jpg|thumb|Khorasan wheat]]

* '''Oats''' - there is some evidence to say that 4/5 people with coeliac disease can tolerate uncontaminated oats without any damage or symptoms to the small intestine. But since there is no test to determine who can tolerate the grain it's recommended that it be excluded from a gluten free diet.

* '''Couscous''' - is made up of semolina which are little granules of durum wheat which can be cooked by steaming.

===Gluten Free grains===
Other grains that can be included in a gluten free diet are quinoa, buckwheat as well as rice products.

==''Preventing cross contamination''==
===Cooking===
*When using oil to fry food remember to replace the oil after cooking food that contains gluten as there may be crumbs left over, or alternatively fry the gluten free food first.
*Use separate water in a clean pot to boil gluten free pasta and use a separate strainer, or like the oil cook gluten free pasta first then all other pasta.
*Icing sugar mixtures can contain gluten, try replacing these with gluten free alternatives such as [http://www.csrsugar.com.au/GlutenFreeInfo.aspx CSR icing sugar] and [http://www.bundysugar.com.au/products/consumer/icing_sugar Bundaberg Icing products].

===Storage===
*Storing butter,margarine and other condiments separately and clearly labeled containers so others are aware they are for gluten free use.
*Clear labeling of food that has been removed from original packaging in cool rooms and refrigerators.

===Utensils===
*Bread boards, knives and other cooking utensils that are used in food preparation need to be cleaned in a water temperature above 75 degrees Celsius.
*Ensuring all appliances that come into contact with all types of bread and bread products such as toasters, sandwich makers and grills are thoroughly cleaned before using, alternatively using a separate toaster or grill that is for gluten free cooking only.

==''Checklist of knowledge''==
* Gluten is made up of two smaller proteins that have unique properties.
* People affected most by gluten are people with Coeliac Disease. 
* List of foods that have gluten in them and food that do not contain gluten.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Summary ==

With Internet technology growing, peer-to-peer market strategies are growing. Anyone can get involved in making money over the internet and applications by contributing their goods or services. One such service is transportation. Transportation network companies are taking advantage of the supply of smart phones and the demand of transportation. They take Taxicab transport into the 21st century. Riders can request a ride through an application and the nearest driver will transport them. Companies that have thrived at this service in the United States are Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar. Uber has been the most successful reaching 205 cities in 45 countries on 6 continents &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Expansion&quot;. Uber. 10 Sept. 2014. &lt;http://blog.uber.com/expansion/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. Uber alone made over $1 billion in 2013 alone &lt;ref&gt;Nitasha Tiku, &quot;Leaked: Uber's Internal Revenue and Ride Request Numbers&quot; Valleywag, 04 Dec., 2013, &lt;http://valleywag.gawker.com/leaked-ubers-internal-revenue-and-ride-request-number-1475924182&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. 

This success does not go unnoticed. There are many parties that are against Uber services. The biggest being the taxi lobby. Taxi drivers are concerned with the loss of businesses and wages that their drivers are receiving. They also want the Uber drivers to undergo the same background checks that they have to get licenses. There are many worldwide court cases that have been filed against both Uber and local governments in an attempt to close the market to only taxi drivers. There have also been reports of citizens suing the company over harassment, injuries, and death. Uber drivers have sued the company over lost tips.

Although, there are many arguments to ban Uber services, there also benefits that Uber gives to the community. Uber offers easy entry and flexible hours for anyone to apply to have a job. Many drivers are using this job opportunity to earn extra wages, including off duty taxi drivers. The experience offers a personal experience and the application ensures that drivers get paid the fare they deserve. Uber also requires drivers to take any jobs that are requested of them. This means that areas that taxi drivers would be hesitant to go to are served by Uber drivers. This eliminates any locational disparities.

Through these pro-Uber and anti-Uber arguments new policies are being created and upheld. The opportunities for transportation network companies will continue to be debated as their services continue to expand throughout the world.

== List of Actors ==
'''Investors in the New ‘Sharing Economy’'''

The idea is that as long as someone has ownership, then everyone has access. This is the beginnings of the ‘sharing economy’ as we know it today. The ‘sharing economy’ is a peer-to-peer market that utilizes the internet to connect people directly with others to receive a service or rent an item. People rent or sell underutilized resources to those who need them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21573104-internet-everything-hire-rise-sharing-economy&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning with the internet, the sharing economy, quickly made its way to birth ride sharing apps like Uber and Lyft. Through apps, social media, and websites, the sharing economy becomes a digital market place. Commonly known peer-to-peer business eBay allows anyone to become a retailer. Sites like Alibaba only take it a step further, connecting suppliers with innovators. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/09/04/345553002/dead-chickens-a-tiny-motor-and-the-story-of-alibaba&lt;/ref&gt; It benefits ride sharing services to not just see their business succeed, but all peer-to-peer services succeed. In due part, because all peer-to-peer firms face entrenched interests. The peer-to-peer services can also promote their social aspect. Riding in the front seat of an UberX car encourages conversation rather easily compared to the traditional cab service. Services like these play on the social nature of humans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/11/14/245242805/for-ridesharing-apps-like-lyft-commerce-is-a-community&lt;/ref&gt;



'''Investors in Peer-to-Peer Services'''

Ride sharing services like FlightCar still require start-up capital. This comes from Investors, specifically Angel Investors or Venture Capitalist. An Angel Investor is one who is normally wealthy and willing to invest a relative small amount of his or her money into a start-up. An Angle Investor is different from a Venture Capitalist, because they must be willing to invest without taking a seat on the board, and without imposing complex terms.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/how-angel-investing-is-different-than-venture-capital-2010-3&lt;/ref&gt; Venture Capitalists have access to more capital than Angel Investors, but require more from start-ups. With addition to a place on the board of investors, they also traditional take a longer time to decide whether to invest in a start-up or not.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/how-angel-investing-is-different-than-venture-capital-2010-3&lt;/ref&gt;



'''Drivers'''

Drivers are very important to ride sharing services. Other than an interactive app, the driver is the only interaction the customer has with a ride sharing service. Many drivers are cabbies or professional drivers who participate in ride sharing for the extra money. Some drivers drive for multiple ride sharing services.&lt;ref&gt;http://recode.net/2014/04/30/lyft-and-uber-price-wars-leave-some-drivers-feeling-crunched/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Drivers that are employed by UberX are sent an iPhone 4. They use mapping apps, like Waze or Google Maps to look up addresses given to them by passengers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/06/20/taxi-medallions-have-been-the-best-investment-in-america-for-years-now-uber-may-be-changing-that/&lt;/ref&gt; The apps then give turn by turn direction until the destination is reached. The transactions are handled through the app, and can be linked to a PayPal account if preferred. Drivers' tips, 16% (UberX), are also added through the app, and if you wish to add more, you are free to pay cash. The receipt from a ride sharing app fare is digital, being sent straight to your phone. With UberX, a map of your route is also sent. Drivers are prevented from discriminating against clients because of their choice of destination.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/06/20/taxi-medallions-have-been-the-best-investment-in-america-for-years-now-uber-may-be-changing-that/&lt;/ref&gt; Once a driver accepts a client, he or she must follow through with the fare. The ride share apps have no back out option. The incentive is for drivers to finish fares, than look for another fare as soon as possible. Because payment is guaranteed, drivers need not worry about fares skipping out on payment.



'''Customers'''

Most ride share app customers are those who do not own a car. They either cannot afford one, or have figured that using a ride share service is cheaper for them in the long run than owning a car. Many of these customers are younger urbanites, who may enjoy the social aspect of ride sharing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/11/14/245242805/for-ridesharing-apps-like-lyft-commerce-is-a-community&lt;/ref&gt; Other customers use ride sharing apps because they live in low income neighborhoods where public transportation is scarce, and taxis do not prefer to go. Bandwagon, in New York, is popular because people can book by seat on the companies’ website. It is legal because it works with the existing car services that operate mostly at Laguardia and JFK Airports.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xconomy.com/new-york/2014/01/24/rideshare-app-bandwagon-gets-around-legally-in-the-nyc-battleground/&lt;/ref&gt; 

To hail an UberX driver one must sign up through the app on their smart phone or computer. Customers are allowed to see the nearest drivers in their area, and request the one with the highest rating. Once the driver is requested, the app allows for the customer to view the car as it approaches. The car arrives and the customer enters the car and gives the driver the address. Once the customer arrives at their destination they can get out without the need to pay the driver on the spot. The transaction is handled through the app, and soon after the fare is done an email is sent listing your receipt and a map showing your route taken and the price. It also sends another email to rate the driver, and leave a comment. All this is done within short span of time after you finish your fare.

==  Timeline of Events ==


In the winter of 2008, Travis Kalanick, CEO of Uber, and Garrett Camp thought of an idea of using black car service for ride-sharing and using an iPod app in San Francisco. Uber was formally founded in March 2009 and in January 2010, Travis Kalanick, Garrett Camp and Oscar Salazar did their first test run in New York. Uber officially started service in San Francisco in June 2010. &lt;ref&gt; Kalanick, Travis. &quot;Uber's Founding&quot;. Uber. 22 Dec. 2010. &lt;http://blog.uber.com/2010/12/22/ubers-founding/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Scola, Nancy. &quot;The Black Car Company That People Love to Hate&quot;. NEXTCITY. 11 Nov. 2013.&lt;http://nextcity.org/forefront/view/the-black-car-company-that-people-love-to-hate&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

Uber was actively working to develop their business. Kalanick thought of low-cost service, and Uber launched Uber Taxi in Chicago in April 2012. He also issued an “Uber Policy White Paper” regarding ride-sharing, and launched UberX in April 2013. &lt;ref&gt; Scola, Nancy. &quot;The Black Car Company That People Love to Hate&quot;. NEXTCITY. 11 Nov. 2013.&lt;http://nextcity.org/forefront/view/the-black-car-company-that-people-love-to-hate&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;
Uber is boosting business performance and their valuation reached $18.2 billion in June 2014. &lt;ref&gt; Rusli, Evelyn M. and MacMillan, Douglas. &quot;Uber Gets an Uber-Valuation&quot;. The Wall Street Journal. 6 Jul. 2014 &lt;http://online.wsj.com/articles/uber-gets-uber-valuation-of-18-2-billion-1402073876&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;, and they are developing business in 205 cities and 45 countries in the world in August 2014. &lt;ref&gt; &quot;Expansion&quot;. Uber. 10 Sept. 2014. &lt;http://blog.uber.com/expansion/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast with the expanding business activities, there were some movement about tighter regulation towards Uber. In September 2013, California became a first state to regulate ride-sharing. The regulator asked driver to follow the regulations, such as criminal background checks, driver training, a zero-tolerance policy on drugs and alcohol and insurance policies with a minimum of $1 million in liability coverage. &lt;ref&gt; Lifsher, Marc. &quot;California becomes first state in nation to regulate ride-sharing&quot;. Los Angeles Times Articles. 19 Sept. 2013. &lt;http://articles.latimes.com/2013/sep/19/business/la-fi-mo-state-regulators-ok-ridesharing-20130919&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; After that, some states, such as Colorado and Chicago, also required commercial insurance coverage for ride-sharing companies. Some cities, such as Ann Arbor and Nebraska sent a cease and desist letters to Uber and Lyft. &lt;ref&gt; Rayle, Lisa., Shaheen, Susan., Chan, Nelson., Dai, Danielle., &amp; Cervero, Robert. &quot;App-Based, On-Demand Ride Services: Comparing Taxi and Ridesourcing Trips and User Characteristics in San Francisco&quot;. University of California, Berkeley. Aug. 2014. &lt;http://www.uctc.net/research/papers/UCTC-FR-2014-08.pdf&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Europe’s taxi drivers held a strike toward Uber in several cities such as London, Paris, Madrid, Rome and Berlin in June 2014. They claimed that Uber driver should obey the same rules as taxi drivers about spending enormous money on a license and insurance. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Europe’s taxi drivers strike over mobile phone app Uber&quot;. Euronews. 11 Jun. 2014. &lt;http://www.euronews.com/2014/06/11/europe-s-taxi-drivers-strike-over-mobile-phone-app-uber/&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

Uber’s business is becoming a problem. In January 2014, Uber was accused of malicious tactics to the competitor and admitted to the accusations. Uber’s employee ordered and then cancelled Gett’s service, which started a black car business in New York. Moreover, they tried to recruit Gett drivers. Uber admitted these action and made a statement. The content of statement was as follows;&lt;ref&gt; Empson, Rip. &quot;Black Car Competitor Accuses Uber Of DDoS-Style Attack; Uber Admits Tactics Are “Too Aggressive”&quot;. TechCrunch. 24 Jan. 2014. &lt;http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/24/black-car-competitor-accuses-uber-of-shady-conduct-ddos-style-attack-uber-expresses-regret/&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;It was likely too aggressive a sales tactic and we regret the team’s approach to outreach of these drivers. But to be clear there was no time spent by the providers as the requests were canceled immediately and Uber did pay cancellation fees for these requests. We have messaged city teams to curtail activities that seek lead generation by requesting transportation services.&lt;ref&gt; Empson, Rip. &quot;Black Car Competitor Accuses Uber Of DDoS-Style Attack; Uber Admits Tactics Are “Too Aggressive”&quot;. TechCrunch. 24 Jan. 2014. &lt;http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/24/black-car-competitor-accuses-uber-of-shady-conduct-ddos-style-attack-uber-expresses-regret/&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Cases of trouble regarding Uber’s driver are also reported. In March 2014, Uber expanded the driver’s insurance coverage. It is said that the beginning of policy change was the lawsuit against Uber. The Uber driver had an accident in San Francisco on New Year’s Eve, 2013; however, Uber stated that it was not legally responsible for this accident because there was no passenger at that time. As a result, the lawyer of victim’s family filed a suit against Uber and argued that the company should be responsible for this accident. &lt;ref&gt; Popper, Ben. &quot;When an Uber driver kills someone, who is responsible?&quot;. The Verge. 28 Jan. 2014. &lt;http://www.theverge.com/2014/1/28/5350660/lawsuit-uber-accident-death-girl-liability-insurance&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Welch, Chris. &quot;After lawsuit over young girl's death, Uber expands driver insurance coverage&quot;. The Verge. 14 Mar. 2014. &lt;http://www.theverge.com/2014/3/14/5508568/uber-expands-driver-insurance-coverage-after-girls-death&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; In July 2014, an Uber driver kidnapped the passenger and the passenger was involved in a high-speed chase at Washington D.C. &lt;ref&gt; CNBC.com staff. &quot;Uber driver kidnaps rider, leads high-speed chase in D.C.&quot; CNBC LLC. 10 Jul. 2014. &lt;http://www.cnbc.com/id/101826764&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;

==  Policy Issues ==

Since Uber began in June 2010, Transportation Network Companies (TNC) have been operating on the fringe of current laws and outside of most regulations, in most locations operating before legislatures can put formal ordinances in place. This has left legislatures around the country in a position where they must react to current operations or circumstances which arise in their jurisdictions. In most cities that TNC operate in there are no formal regulations that allow or declare illegal their operations, so they must rely on the continued lack of action or interpretation from current officials. In return most legislatures have been left to create regulation in reaction to events, as in the case of Insurance in California.

===Minneapolis Regulations===

After months of negotiations between, service providers, city officials, and drivers; on July 18, 2014 Minneapolis became the 6th jurisdiction in the country to provide regulations for alternative taxi-like services, such as Lyft and UberX.&lt;ref&gt; Mpls. City Council OKs Uber, Lyft. Perf. KARE 11 Staff. Mpls. City Council OKs Uber, Lyft. KARE 11, n.d. Web. 17 Sept. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Transportation Network Companies (TNC) Ordinance, provides the cities first regulation on such services, who had previously been operating their offerings unregulated and illegally.&lt;ref&gt;Roper, Eric. &quot;Minneapolis Joins Other Cities Regulating Lyft, UberX.&quot; Star Tribunr (18 July 2014): n. pag. StarTribune.com: News, Weather, Sports from Minneapolis, St. Paul and Minnesota. Web. 17 Sept. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the TNC ordinance, licenses are offered to the larger company, such as UberX or Lyft, and only require individual drivers receive endorsement. In order to receive a driver endorsement, drivers must possess a valid Minnesota or Wisconsin driver’s license, be at least eighteen years old, be able to understand English, properly dressed, and pass both criminal and driving background checks. There is also a requirement that a driver own his/her own vehicle and that that vehicle undergoes proper inspection which ensures a vehicle be free of rust or damage as well as a multi-point inspection of vehicle component operation (very similar to required annual inspections). It is important to note that these are the same requirements tradition taxis and their drivers must undergo, however under the new ordinance the licensee (such as UberX or Lyft) is able to perform inspection of drivers and cars instead of city inspectors.&lt;ref&gt;United States of America. City of Minneapolis. Licenses and Consumer Services. Minneapolis Transportation Network Companies (TNC) Ordinance. City of Minneapolis, 18 July 2014.

The TNC ordinance also regulates the operations of such companies. Drivers are restricted from accepting fares unless they have already made the request for a pick up through the licensee’s network. Additionally, licensees are permitted to only augment driver insurance policy, however licensees are required to provide proof of financial ability to cover any financial costs that may be involved with any incidents. For hire cars under the TNC ordinance are not required to operate under the same price ceilings that taxis are.
This ordinance, does not apply to any services only providing drop off in the city for passengers picked up outside of city limits.&lt;ref&gt;United States of America. City of Minneapolis.

===Insurance in California===

On December 31, 2013 a Honda driven by an Uber driver named Muzaffar struck Sofia Liu and her mother and brother leading to the death of Sofia, a six year old girl. Although Muzaffar was logged in to Uber at the time he was not carrying any passengers in his vehicle, Uber denied any responsibility. According to Uber, due to the fact the Muzaffar was in-between fares he was not actively an Uber driver at the time of the incident, and therefore there was no obligation for Uber to compensate the Liu family. This spurred outrage from both the general public and Uber drivers, who felt it, was unfair for Uber to charge a percentage of all rates to drivers but not share a percentage of the responsibility for participating in the network.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. &quot;Uber Sued for Wrongful Death of 6-year-old Girl.&quot; USA Today. N.p., 28 Jan. 2014. Web. 17 Sept. 2014. &lt;http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usatoday.com%2Fstory%2Ftech%2F2014%2F01%2F28%2Fuber-wrongful-death-lawsuit%2F4959127%2F&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In response to this event and in an attempt to protect any future victims and drivers the California state assembly passed the Transportation network companies: insurance coverage bill to amend the Passenger Charter-party Carriers’ Act, which became law on September 4, 2014. Under the new bill TNC are now required to cover $370,000 for all drivers who are have a smartphone app turned on and a requirement for that coverage to exceed $1 million whenever a driver is matched with a passenger. This is more than 30x the required coverage for traditional taxis. Original proponents of the bill withdrew support of the bill when coverage for drivers logged in to an app without a match dropped from $750,000 due to objections from TNC.&lt;ref&gt;United States of America.

===Carpooling in California===

As in many states it is currently illegal in California for taxis to pick up more than one fair at a time, or charge individual fares. This service in California is reserved for companies licensed as passenger stage corporations (PSC) much like Super Shuttles or Go Airport Shuttle. On September 8, 2014 the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) informed Uber, Lyft, and Sidecar that there carpool services were in violation of section 5401 of the California public utilities Code which states “[N]o charter-party carrier of passengers shall …  demand or receive compensation, for the transportation offered … on an individual-fare basis.” This is just the latest in the long line of opportunities for either political propulsion or stagnation for the initiatives of the taxi-alternative TNCs. The same governing bodies are also not predictable, the CPUC that chose to take the conservative approach of enforcing taxi regulations on TNCs for shared ride services, until legislative action can be made, chose last year to establish temporary rules and allow TNCs to operate before the  California Legislature could act.&lt;ref&gt;Rogowsky, Mark. &quot;California Threatens To Shut Down Uber's New Carpooling Service [UPDATED].&quot; Forbes.

==  Arguments Against Uber ==
===Taxi and Limo Drivers===

In an attempt to minimize lost taxi wages, Uber set minimum fares to ensure that customers that want a cheaper rate can still use taxis &lt;ref&gt;Waller, Mark. &quot;Debate about the Uber digital car hiring service arrives in full force before the New Orleans City Council.&quot; NOLA.com. N.p., 24 June 2014. Web. 11 Sept. 2014. &lt;http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2&lt;/ref&gt; . Taxi drivers still believe that even though there are price minimums for Transportation Network Companies, they are still losing wages and tips. More importantly, Taxi companies want the Uber drivers to undergo the same background checks as they have to complete &lt;ref&gt;Waller, Mark. &quot;Debate about the Uber digital car hiring service arrives in full force before the New Orleans City Council.&quot; NOLA.com. N.p., 24 June 2014. Web. 11 Sept. 2014. &lt;http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2&lt;/ref&gt; . Taxi Drivers have background checks that ensure that they will be safe drivers and not put their companies at risk. The taxi drivers believe it is unfair that they have different standards. 

Uber also offers a service called 'Uber Black' for high end luxury car service. These are still priced with a minimum charge that is higher than taxis but are priced like limousines. Limo drivers are also filing lawsuits against Uber in an attempt to get rid of the company and increase their business &lt;ref&gt;Waller, Mark. &quot;Debate about the Uber digital car hiring service arrives in full force before the New Orleans City Council.&quot; NOLA.com. N.p., 24 June 2014. Web. 11 Sept. 2014. &lt;http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2&lt;/ref&gt; . 

These standards are similar throughout the world. Many countries have taxi and limousine services that are filing lawsuits against Transportation Network Companies.

===Safety===

Taxi drivers undergo background checks to ensure that drivers have safe driving records and no criminal pasts. Uber does not require as extensive of a background check. Although accidents are sometimes unpreventable, practicing safe driving habits will reduce the number of incidents. Requiring a background check, and having a driving test, will eliminate drivers that have unsafe driving records. This will reduce the number of injuries and fatalities caused by Uber drivers. Unfortunately, fatalities have already occurred. Six-year-old Sofia Liu was run over in a crosswalk by an Uber driver that was on duty. Sofias mother and brother were also severely injured. The Uber Company is denying insurance protection for the driver and the family &lt;ref&gt;Melendez, Lyanne. &quot;Uber sued for wrongful death of 6-year-old girl Sophia Liu.&quot; ABC7 San Francisco. N.p., 27 Jan. 2014. Web. 11 Sept. 2014. &lt;http://abc7news.com/archive/9408512/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. This is only one of countless examples of Uber drivers practicing unsafe behaviors injuring civilians. 

Investigative journalists around the world have begun conducting investigations on the background checks of these Uber drivers. There are numerous incidents of Uber drivers that have criminal records &lt;ref&gt;Waller, Mark. &quot;Voices from readers on the Uber debate, which returns to the New Orleans City Council Thursday.&quot; NOLA.com. N.p., 4 Sept. 2012. Web. 11 Sept. 2014. &lt;http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2014/09/voices_from_reades_on_the_uber.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. These drivers would not have qualified for taxi driver licenses. 

Background checks and driving tests are not able to check for behavior issues. Numerous Uber patrons have reported unwanted sexual advances and homophobic, racial, and gender slurs. One of the reported incidents that made it to court involved a Chicago woman that claimed that an Uber driver hit on her, groped her, and refused to let her out of his car &lt;ref&gt;Scola, Nancy. &quot;Chicago Assault Lawsuit Adds to the Pile of UberX’s Woes.&quot; – Next City. N.p., 21 Mar. 2014. Web. 11 Sept. 2014. &lt;http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/chicago-assault-lawsuit-adds-to-the-pile-of-uberxs-woes&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. She sued the company and the driver. Uber responded to the incident by saying that they would increase the number of background checks.

===Accountability===

Ubers relationship with its drivers is hard to define: employer/employee, business partners, etc. This creates confusion and unclear legal representation. The Uber application has 'no risk and no accountability' &lt;ref&gt;Waller, Mark. &quot;Debate about the Uber digital car hiring service arrives in full force before the New Orleans City Council.&quot; NOLA.com. N.p., 24 June 2014. Web. 11 Sept. 2014. &lt;http://www.nola.com/business/index.ssf/2014/06/debate_about_the_uber_digital.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. Although Uber has a million dollar coverage for driver liability, drivers often have to use their own insurance to cover damages&lt;ref&gt;Soper, Taylor . &quot;Taxi drivers defend suit against Uber in Seattle, say they want level playing field - GeekWire.&quot; GeekWire. N.p., 25 Mar. 2014. Web. 11 Sept. 2014. &lt;http://www.geekwire.com/2014/heres-taxi-drivers-suing-uber-seattle/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Uber does offer a price minimum. They do not, however, hold a uniform price. Passengers do not have the ability to compare all the prices. This can lead to price manipulation on the behalf of Uber. These prices already include a tip. Drivers are not able to accept tips from their passengers. Uber drivers are suing the company for these lost tips &lt;ref&gt;Brustein, Joshua. &quot;Uber's Other Legal Mess: Drivers  Sue Over Missing Tips.&quot; &lt;i&gt;Business Week&lt;/i&gt;. N.p., 29 Aug. 2013. Web. 11 Sept. 2014. &amp;lt;http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-29/ubers-other-legal-mess- drivers-sue-over-missing-tips&amp;gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. The tip that is added onto the fare is a high percentage of 20% of the total bill. This means that regardless of the quality of service, the driver is guaranteed this steep tip. This gives the driver little incentive to provide the passenger with exceptional service. The drivers are not held accountable. The prices of Uber are already quite low, taking away from taxi business, so these drivers are not making what they could with extra tips. 

Germany outlawed the use of Uber car recently. One of the reasons that they are banning the practice is that the drivers are not offered adequate pensions, medical leaves, and paid holidays &lt;ref&gt;Noack, Rick. &quot;Why Germany (and Europe) fears Uber.&quot; Washington Post. The Washington Post, 4 Sept. 2014. Web. 11 Sept. 2014. &lt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/09/04/why-germany-and-europe-fears-uber/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. German government officials claim that Uber is creating a more 'Western' environment where full-time jobs with benefits are being replaced by 'insecure and unreliable opportunities to earn money'. Uber casts their business upon other countries that have laws already established against these types of businesses. Uber does not consider these laws when considering where to allow Uber to expand.

==Arguments in Favor of Uber==
===Personal Experiences===

Requests for rides are submitted via a smartphone (or computer to minimize the digital divide). Once the driver arrives at the destination, the passenger sits in the front seat. This increases that personal connection with the driver. Many passengers know their drivers by name, which differs from the unfamiliar nature of taxi encounters. Passengers are also charged a fee automatically, so drivers do not have to worry about passengers avoiding paying their fare.

===Driver Opportunities===

The driver application process is really simple. All that is needed is internet access and a driver's license. Applicants submit forms and are either guaranteed or denied the request to become a driver. Since hours are very flexible, some people use this job as a part-time job to earn more money. Taxi drivers often use this to supplement their daily duties. In an interest to make opportunities equal, Uber gives iPhone 4 devices to drivers that do not have access to the app. This eliminates hiring bias to people that do not have access to smartphone technology. 

===Access to Locations===

Taxi drivers look for patrons by driving through the neighborhoods that will serve them the best and give them the greatest number of clients. They can refuse service to anyone based on where they are going, as well as other factors. Uber cars do not operate in the same fashion. Once a request for an uber driver gets sent to a driver, the driver has to pick up that client. Areas of the city that would usually go underserved now have more equal access to transportation.

===Immediacy and Sufficiency===

Compared to traditional taxis service, Uber cars are usually sufficient, and the waiting time for people who have booked a Uber car is also lower. According to a research at University of California Transportation Center, during the evening peak, 92% of Uber cars could get to the location where customers had booked within 10 minutes, while only 16% taxis could arrive within the same length of time. Also, it took 37% taxis more than 20 minutes to get to customer's location, while less than 1% Uber cars would waste so long.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Rayle, Susan Shaheen, Nelson Chan,  Danielle Dai, and Robert Cervero, &quot;App-Based, On-Demand Ride Services: Comparing Taxi and Ridesourcing Trips and User Characteristics in  San Francisco&quot;, UCTC-FR-2014-08, Aug., 2014&lt;/ref&gt;In addition, during peak hours or pretty bad weathers, people will usually find it hard to catch a cab. In contrast, due the surge pricing solution of Uber, people are easy to find enough Uber cars during those occasions, though they might pay more-it is the sufficient financial incentive that keeps Uber drivers stay on the road, even under some extremely serious weathers.

===Safety and Comfort===

For many there are many aspects of current transportation offerings that create environments that are less than inviting, whether it is the fear of bodily harm or less than cleanly conditions. TNC allow for innovation to create networks that individually address a combination or all of these and other concerns of individuals with a desire to drop single occupancy vehicles (SOV). One such example of these initiatives is SheTaxi, a service that started on September 16, 2014 in New York, New York. SheTaxi was started by Stella Mateo, a mother of two, who recognized both the apprehension of other females in accessing taxis, limousines, TNC, and other services with a male driver and an extreme shortage of female drivers (Only 5% of professional drivers in NYC).&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, Jacob. &quot;New Taxi Service Is Like Uber.&quot; Transportation.

On SheTaxi’s first day there was an increase in the number of female drivers in NYC of 2%, although Ms. Mateo hopes the number keeps growing.&lt;ref&gt;Hu, Winnie. &quot;New Service Offers Taxis Exclusively for Women.&quot; The New York Times.

==Opportunities and Challenges==


Despite the critics, Uber keeps on developing rapidly. By June 2014, the valuation of Uber has reached 18 billion dollars, one of the highest records among start-ups.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Ross Sorkin, &quot;Why Uber Might Well be Worth $18 Billion&quot;, New York Times, 9 Jun., 2014, &lt;http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/06/09/how-uber-pulls-in-billions-all-via-iphone/?_php=true&amp;_type=blogs&amp;_r=0&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Even so, there is still an opinion that Uber's whopping valuation is underestimated. According to Uber's financial information that leaked to the gossip website Valleywag at Dec. 2013, total payment for the full cost of the rides from Uber is roughly $20 million per week during Oct. to Nov. 2013, which means $1.068 billion for the whole 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Nitasha Tiku, &quot;Leaked: Uber's Internal Revenue and Ride Request Numbers&quot; Valleywag, 04 Dec., 2013, &lt;http://valleywag.gawker.com/leaked-ubers-internal-revenue-and-ride-request-number-1475924182&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Generally think of Uber's cut as 20 percent, as Travis Kalanick said in a Bloomberg interview,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Uber's CEO: We Have No Plans for an IPO Right Now&quot;, Bloomberg TV, 25 Nov. 2013, &lt;http://www.bloomberg.com/video/uber-s-ceo-we-have-no-plans-for-an-ipo-right-now-rr_38Q~qSla9YBqF0Xy1SQ.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; that makes $213 million in revenue for 2013. Those figures show how profitable Uber was during the last year, and yet there is a larger picture as well as some challenges in front of this young start-up.

===Opportunity with Google===

Back to Aug. 2013, during Uber's capital raising, Google Ventures invested $258 million into Uber, which was Google Ventures' largest deal ever.&lt;ref&gt;Alex Wilhelm, Alexia Tsotsis &quot;Google Ventures Puts $258M Into Uber, Its Largest Deal Ever&quot; Techcrunch, 22 Aug., 2013, &lt;http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/22/google-ventures-puts-258m-into-uber-its-largest-deal-ever/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Cooperating with this internet giant seems to be a great opportunity for Uber, not restricted to finance. It is possible that Uber's service might be combined with Google's ongoing research on driverless or autonomous cars, and this technology will enable people to order self-driven Uber cars from their smartphones. The potential of this technology is much greater than is commonly realized. Another possibility is to use Uber as a delivery service for Google Shopping Express. Uber has tested its new UberRUSH courier service in New York City, and a combined Google-Uber effort could make themselves a significant force in the E-business area.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hof, &quot;As Google Ventures Invests $250 Million In Uber, What's Next? Driverless Cars On Demand?&quot;  Forbes, 23 Aug., 2013, &lt;http://www.forbes.com/sites/roberthof/2013/08/23/as-google-ventures-invests-250-million-in-uber-whats-next-driverless-cars-on-demand/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Google’s expertise in dealing with the government could help Uber solve its legal and other disputes on car services in many of its most important markets.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Brustein, &quot;From Google, Uber Gets Money and Political Muscle&quot;, Businessweek, 26 Aug., 2013, &lt;http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-08-26/from-google-uber-gets-money-and-political-muscle&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market Growth and Policy Benifits===
Market and policies are another two significant opportunities for Uber. As a company founded in 2009, Uber has its service in 100 cities by July 2014&lt;ref&gt;Tecent Tech and Rachel Hong, &quot;Here's How Uber Can Win In The Stiffly Competitive Chinese Car Service Market&quot;, ''Business Insider'', 25 Aug., 2014, &lt;http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-china-2014-8&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;，and it has been continuing to actively expand its market and clear obstacles, both from domestic and abroad. On July 30, 2013, State of California approved a proposal that allowed Uber to operate legally.&lt;ref&gt;Public Utilities Commission, State of California,&quot;DECISION ADOPTING RULES AND REGULATIONS TO  PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY WHILE ALLOWING NEW ENTRANTS  TO THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY &quot;, 30 July, 2013 &lt;http://docs.cpuc.ca.gov/PublishedDocs/Efile/G000/M073/K768/73768000.PDF&gt; &lt;/ref&gt;Similarly, Minnesota State also gives nod to Lyft and Uber car services by legalizing ride-sharing services.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Boros, &quot;Minneapolis approves Uber, Lyft&quot;, ''Minnpost'', 18 July, 2014, &lt;http://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2014/07/minneapolis-approves-uber-lyft&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;For the international market, on July 14, 2014, Uber CEO Travis Kalanick announced in Beijing that Uber would officially be entering the city. By adopting some localized strategies, such as partner with standardized car rental companies to avoid legal risks&lt;ref&gt;Tecent Tech and Rachel Hong, &quot;Here's How Uber Can Win In The Stiffly Competitive Chinese Car Service Market&quot;, ''Business Insider'', 25 Aug., 2014, &lt;http://www.businessinsider.com/uber-china-2014-8&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, Uber is seeking its own approach to win in China's market.

===Carpooling Service===

Uber as well as some other similar companies have put forward the carpooling service. Uber’s version, named UberPool, will will connect app users heading in the same direction and thus let riders who use the service pay half-fare. Uber says its normal service, where riders can summon an uber taxi within minutes using their smartphone, is 40% cheaper than the average taxi. UberPool would cut that bill by another 50%.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Davidson, &quot;Uber and Lyft Get Cheaper With New Carpooling Services&quot;, Money, 6 Aug., 2014, &lt;http://time.com/money/3085913/uber-lyft-carpooling-service-uberpool/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;That would significantly lower the cost of those who use this service. On a social level, a research from Massachusetts Institute of Technology shows that carpooling is able to reduce the overall journey time of travelers by 30% at most, and abate air pollution as well. &lt;ref&gt;Paolo Santi, Giovanni Resta, Michael Szell, Stanislav Sobolevsky, Steven Strogatz, Carlo Ratti, &quot;Taxi pooling in New York City: a network-based approach to social sharing problems&quot;, National Acad Sciences, 10 Oct., 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenges: Threat and Competition===

At the same time, Uber is faced with various challenges. Just as every emerging entrepreneur, Uber has met with some robust change resistance from the traditional industry. On January 24, 2014, striking cab drivers in Paris carried out violate attacks towards cars booked through Uber, by shattering windows, smashing mirrors and slashing tires.&lt;ref&gt;Dylan Stableford, &quot;French Taxi Drivers Attack Uber Cars in Paris&quot;, Yahoo, 14 Jan., 2014, &lt;https://www.yahoo.com/tech/french-taxi-drivers-attack-uber-cars-in-paris-73347907700.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;That was the first violent incident aiming at Uber, but long before that, Uber has already encountered political resistance from several regions. In Dec., 2013, French government issued a new bill that required any car booked via Uber or similar services to wait a minimum of 15 minutes after receiving the order before picking up the passenger, and that would undercut the key advantage of Uber: get a chauffeur-driven car to any address in central Paris within a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Romain Dillet, &quot;Uber, LeCab And Others Now Have To Wait 15 Minutes Before Picking You Up In France&quot;, TechCrunch,  28 Dec., 2013, &lt;http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/28/uber-lecab-and-others-now-have-to-wait-15-minutes-before-picking-you-up-in-france/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;In German, Uber was practically banned throughout the nation, and public opinion in German was also on the opposite side to Uber.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Noack, &quot;Why Germany (and Europe) fears Uber&quot;, the Washington Post, 4 Sep.,2014, &lt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/worldviews/wp/2014/09/04/why-germany-and-europe-fears-uber/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;Seoul, the capital of South Korea, banned Uber and planned to develop its own app instead in July, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;JEYUP S. KWAAK, &quot;Seoul Moves to Ban Uber, Plans Own App&quot;, The Wall Street Journal, 21 Jul., 2014, &lt;http://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2014/07/21/seoul-moves-to-ban-uber-plans-own-app/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; At United States, Miami, Austin and Las Vegas have imposed high minimum fares for chauffeur-driven cars, while Colorado has proposed rules that would bar them from picking up and discharging passengers within 200 feet of hotels, restaurants, and bars.&lt;ref&gt;Carol Matlack, &quot;France Could Put the Brakes on Uber's Mobile-App Car Service&quot;, Businessweek, 25 July, 2013, &lt;http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2013-07-25/france-could-put-the-brakes-on-ubers-mobile-app-car-service&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In Boston and Chicago, taxi operators sued their cities for allowing unregulated companies to devalue million-dollar operating permits.&lt;ref&gt;Brad Stone, &quot;Invasion of the Taxi Snatchers: Uber Leads an Industry's Disruption&quot;, Businessweek, 20 Feb., 2014, &lt;http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-02-20/uber-leads-taxi-industry-disruption-amid-fight-for-riders-drivers#p1&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Another inevitable challenge is from Uber's competitors. Uber's two biggest competitors at United States, Sidecar and Lyft, arose in early 2012. These two companies not only followed Uber's mode, which was to connect cars and people through smartphones, but also went one step further that allowed any driver with a spare seat to pick up passengers who’ve requested a ride with their smartphone. Furthermore, Uber and its rivals are cloning each other's schemes, such as Lyft's Prime Time Tips vs Uber’s Surge Pricing&lt;ref&gt;Liz Gannes, &quot;Competition Brings Lyft, Sidecar and Uber Closer to Cloning Each Other&quot;, Allthings, 16 Nov., 2013, &lt;http://allthingsd.com/20131116/competition-brings-lyft-sidecar-and-uber-closer-to-cloning-each-other-and-cabs/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;, and they have grown to look more and more alike. This homogenization may undermine Uber's competitive advantages. Even in the China's market which Uber has just entered, some formidable rivals already exist-the well-known taxi-hailing apps Kuaidi and Didi, as well as a similar Chinese company Yongche. In addition, the entrenched taxis interest and prejudice towards app in new markets could also be an obstruction for Uber's future development.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Summary ==
Since the 19th Century, mass transit has been an integral part of transportation in the City of Toronto. Beginning with horse-drawn omnibuses and streetcars, and evolving to subway systems and rail transit, the city has shown consistent interest in the improvements of their mass transit systems. However, with Rob Ford, Transit City and suburban versus urban debates, the mass transit systems in Toronto are at a turning point. Currently, the Toronto Transit Service Improvement Plan focuses on cost-effective service but does not plan for any new lines to be created. With the coming election on October 27th, 2014, the expansion of the Toronto transit system will continue to be a topic of discussion, controversy and unique solutions.

== History of Mass Transit in Toronto ==

Mass transit in Toronto began in the early 19th century, primarily on Yonge Street, a major thoroughfare in the city. The first of these modes was the stage coach, which was operational throughout most of the century. By 1849, stage coach travel had expanded to include horse-drawn omnibuses made by Burt Williams. Initially, Williams created four six-person omnibuses. These omnibuses were similar in style to the concurrent stage coaches, but smaller and more comfortable. With the immediate popularity of the six-passenger omnibus, Williams created larger versions which sat ten passengers. After only a few years, the Yonge Street omnibuses were servicing stations between St. Lawrence Market and Yorkville multiple times each hour. The set route, short ride, and fixed price of the omnibuses, served as a model for streetcars, and later the subway system in Toronto. &lt;ref name=&quot;History of Transit in Toronto&quot; [http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0012.shtml]&gt;Transit Toronto, &quot;A Brief History of Transit in Toronto&quot; Mark Brader, April, 21st, 2012, &lt;http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0012.shtml&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.
In 1861, Alex Easton moved to Toronto, from Philadelphia, to promote his horse-drawn street railway and the “Haddon Car”. With the success of the omnibuses, Toronto business owners were interested in building a street railway system which could carry more passengers along the busy Yonge Street route.  With Easton as president, the City Council created the Toronto Street Railway Company (TSR) in 1891. This fledgling company was immediately given a 30 year franchise for street railway rights in Toronto. By September of 1861, the first streetcar route was opened, following roughly the same track as William’s omnibuses from St. Lawrence Market to Yorkville on Yonge Street. Within the year, a second route was opened west of Yonge Street from Queen Street to Dundas Street (the modern Ossignton Avenue). The larger passenger cars, prominent investors, and City Council support of the street railway proved too high of competition for William’s omnibus. In 1862, Burt William’s was forced to sell, rendering omnibuses nearly extinct. The Toronto Street Railway Company left long standing effects in the mass transit of Toronto. It was Easton’s street railway that established the standard track gauge of 4’-10 7/8”, still used by the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) . This unique gauge is speculated to be the result of assurances to the City Council  that steam railroads would never use the street railway system, or possible due to the standard size of an English wagon width&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Transit in Toronto&quot; [http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0012.shtml]&gt;Transit Toronto, &quot;A Brief History of Transit in Toronto&quot; Mark Brader, April, 21st, 2012, &lt;http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0012.shtml&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

The close of the 19th century brought significant changes to the mass transit system in Toronto. The Toronto Street Railway Company 30 year franchise ended in 1891. Seeing the success, and driven by the want to electrify the street railway, the Toronto City Council decided to make the street railway a publicly owned system. After much discourse and discussion, the price of $1.4 Million paid to the Toronto Street Railway Company was reached and public operation began. However, the City of Toronto quickly decided it was much too risky to maintain the street railway and offered a franchise to a company which would electrify the system. In September of 1891, the newly formed Toronto Railway Company (TRC) was granted a 30 year franchise by the Toronto City Council. Within a year, electric streetcars were in service, and by 1894 horse-drawn mass transit systems were entirely obsolete&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Transit in Toronto&quot; [http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0012.shtml]&gt;Transit Toronto, &quot;A Brief History of Transit in Toronto&quot; Mark Brader, April, 21st, 2012, &lt;http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0012.shtml&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. It is worth note, that within this era, subway lines were proposed. However, these were costly, and quickly dismissed for the following decades&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Yonge Subway&quot; [http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5102.shtml]&gt;Transit Toronto, &quot;A History of the Original Yonge Subway Line&quot; James Bow, August 14th, 2014, &lt;http://transit.toronto.on.ca/subway/5102.shtml&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.
The Toronto Railway Company laid the modern foundation for future mass transit systems in Toronto. Lead by the company’s president, William Mackenzie, the electrified streetcars featured discounted fares for students and children, and free transfers, both commonly seen among transit systems today. The success of the Toronto Railway Company did not last long, however. By 1910, William Mackenzie was experiencing financial troubles with both the TRC and the Canadian Northern Railway. This was furthered when, out of concerns the franchise would not be renewed, Mackenzie refused requests from the City of Toronto to extend routes to surrounding annexed villages. The Toronto Railway Company franchise was not renewed in 1921&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Transit in Toronto&quot; [http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0012.shtml]&gt;Transit Toronto, &quot;A Brief History of Transit in Toronto&quot; Mark Brader, April, 21st, 2012, &lt;http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0012.shtml&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.
Under the 1920 Provincial Act, the Toronto Transportation Commission (TTC) had been created. This commission took control of the street railway systems in 1921, and the Toronto mass transit was once again publicly controlled. The unification of the street railway was a difficult task, but necessary to expand the transportation mode. By 1910, the system had multiple separate rail systems. The annexation areas in the surrounding villages, West Toronto and North Toronto each had individual, unconnected lines and collected their own fares. Under the TTC, the nine fare systems were consolidated and efforts were made to create transfers between each of the systems. By 1953, 35 new city routes and 23 suburban routes were added to the Toronto Transportation Commission railway system&lt;ref name=&quot;Looking Back&quot; [https://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/History/Looking_Back.jsp]&gt;Toronto Transit Commission, &quot;Looking Back&quot; 2014, &lt;https://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/History/Looking_Back.jsp&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

By 1927, the TTC had successfully unified the system and was running all streetcars in Toronto.  This unification of the system and improvements made to infrastructure helped dramatically increase ridership throughout the 1920’s.  The stock market crash of 1929 brought this growth to a grinding halt, but the TTC was able to weather through the 20 percent ridership loss and continue to make improvements.  One of these improvements was the 1938 investment in the new President’s Conference Committee (PCC) cars.  These new cars, along with the Second World War, helped ridership to surge throughout the 1940’s&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Transit in Toronto&quot; [http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0012.shtml]&gt;Transit Toronto, &quot;A Brief History of Transit in Toronto&quot; Mark Brader, April, 21st, 2012, &lt;http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0012.shtml&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

As automobile use became increasingly prevalent, traffic in the City of Toronto was getting to be a pressing issue.  The narrow streets were clogged and chaotic with the mix of autos, streetcars, and horse-drawn carts.  In 1942, the TTC first proposed underground streetcar lines on Queen and Yonge Streets.  However, it wasn’t until after the war that voters approved construction of a subway underneath Yonge Street, in addition to a streetcar subway beneath Queen.  Construction commenced in 1949&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Transit in Toronto&quot; [http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0012.shtml]&gt;Transit Toronto, &quot;A Brief History of Transit in Toronto&quot; Mark Brader, April, 21st, 2012, &lt;http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0012.shtml&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In the early 1950’s, the Province of Ontario decided to join Toronto and its twelve suburbs into a single municipality, called the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto.  The Toronto Transportation Commission was brought under the jurisdiction of this new Municipality and renamed the Toronto Transit Commission.  The new agency was now in charge of an area several times larger than previous&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Transit in Toronto&quot; [http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0012.shtml]&gt;Transit Toronto, &quot;A Brief History of Transit in Toronto&quot; Mark Brader, April, 21st, 2012, &lt;http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0012.shtml&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.
In 1954, construction was completed on the Yonge Street subway, Canada’s first subway line.  This new line was an instant success and almost immediately plans were created for expansion.  This first subway line was paid for almost entirely from fare revenue, although subsequent extensions had to be funded almost entirely by Provincial and local government subsidies&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Transit in Toronto&quot; [http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0012.shtml]&gt;Transit Toronto, &quot;A Brief History of Transit in Toronto&quot; Mark Brader, April, 21st, 2012, &lt;http://transit.toronto.on.ca/spare/0012.shtml&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Subway Systems ====

It is 100 years since the first mayoral candidate for the City of Toronto, Horatio Clarence Hocken, made the underground issue the main plank of his campaign to become Toronto’s mayor (1910).Although Hocken did not win the mayoral race in 1910 (it was won by George R. Geary who opposed subways) his idea of subways received overwhelming support from the citizens of Toronto. The result of a referendum held on subways together with the Mayoral ballot question was supported almost two to one (19,268 to 10,697). Yet, after numerous studies and reports, development of a subway plan and the issuing of a call for tenders for the construction of the first subway, the City backed away from its subway plans. It did not have the support of citizens who were weary of rising taxes.

It was another 36 years before the subway question was raised again in earnest (1946). This time the City approached the issue of financing first. It secured support from the federal government (up to 20% of the cost of the project) and developed a capital financing plan for transit revenues to fund the remainder, with the City taking responsibility for funding the moving and improvement of pipes and installation of roads. This time, when the referendum was put to citizens with a well thought out financing plan, it was supported seven to one (69,935 to 8,630). In 1946 (April) Toronto City Council approved construction of the Yonge Street subway line. Construction began on the Yonge Subway line on September 8, 1949 and it opened from Eglinton to Union in 1954; 44 years after Hocken ran on subways as the main plank of his campaign for Mayor. In 1952 Allan Austin Lamport was elected Mayor of City of Toronto (he later resigned in 1953 to become head of the TTC). In 1953, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario passed the Metropolitan Toronto Act creating Metro Toronto which came into effect in 1954 (Metropolitan Toronto Act, 1953). Fred Gardiner became the first Chairman of Metropolitan Toronto. 

Between 1963 and 1972 eight more subway transit lines were proposed or constructed. In 1972, the Davis Provincial government announced an urban transportation policy for the Province of Ontario “indicating a shift in emphasis from urban expressways to a variety of transportation facilities which put people first.” A subsidy program subsidy of 75% to assist municipalities in the roll out of intermediate capacity transit technology (similar to the Scarborough rapid transit) was announced. A series of light rail transit expansions were proposed for the Toronto region (Intermediate Capacity Transit Plan) based on 1972 population capacities. This light rail plan and others rejected by the TTC. In 1973 (February) the Yonge-University line was extended up Yonge Street to Lawrence and York Mills.In 1974 Paul V. Godfrey became the Chairman of Metropolitan Toronto. In 1986 (June) Metro Toronto Council approved the building of the Sheppard Subway from Downsview to Scarborough Centre in a vote of 36-2.In 1987 (June) a new station was added to the Yonge-University line - North York Centre station.

==  Amalgamation of Toronto ==
In 1998, the Government of Ontario combined six municipalities (City of Toronto, East York, North York, Scarborough, and York) into a “megacity” which is now dubbed the City of Toronto and covers more than 2.6 million residents.  This amalgamation was carried out by the Government of Ontario, because in Canada the municipalities are creations of the provincial government which can change municipality borders when desired.  The rationale for amalgamation, presented by Ontario Premier Mike Harris, was because the governments would be merged together into one the overall size of government could be streamlined and this would result in significant cost savings. The government projected a cost savings of nearly $865 million by the year 2000, thanks mostly to the elimination of upwards of 4,500 civil service jobs &lt;ref name=&quot;Toronto Struggles Against Amalgamation&quot;&gt;[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/torontos-struggle-against-amalgamation/]The Canadian Encyclopedia, &quot;Toronto's Struggle Against Amalgamation&quot; McCleans, March 17th, 1997, &lt;http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/torontos-struggle-against-amalgamation/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  Also, the amalgamation was intended to reduce redundancies throughout the six cities such as unifying the six fire departments, all of which had different training stations and their own fire chief.
The proposed amalgamation was met with stringent opposition from many residents in the six different cities.  Since the amalgamation would reduce the number of city councilors from 106 to 44, the risk of weakening the people’s political voice and making the local government far less responsive to specific local issues was a main concern of residents&lt;ref name=&quot;Toronto Struggles Against Amalgamation&quot;&gt;[http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/torontos-struggle-against-amalgamation/]The Canadian Encyclopedia, &quot;Toronto's Struggle Against Amalgamation&quot; McCleans, March 17th, 1997, &lt;http://thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/torontos-struggle-against-amalgamation/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  Additionally, city mayors were against the idea of amalgamation including the City of Toronto Mayor Barbara Hall and North York Mayor Mel Lastman.  The residents of the six municipalities also held a non-binding referendum in which over 75% of the voters rejected the proposed amalgamation&lt;ref name=&quot;Six Years After Amalgamation&quot;&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/frontpage/2004/09/20/MetroVisions-Toronto-stumbling-six-years-after-huge-mergers/stories/200409200125] Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, &quot;Six Years After Amalgamation&quot; Jeffery Cohen, September 20th, 2004 &lt;http://www.post-gazette.com/frontpage/2004/09/20/MetroVisions-Toronto-stumbling-six-years-after-huge-mergers/stories/200409200125&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  Despite the mandate of the people which was diametrically opposed to amalgamation, the Ontario Government pushed through Bill 103, which combined all six municipalities into the current City of Toronto&lt;ref name=&quot;Six Years After Amalgamation&quot;&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/frontpage/2004/09/20/MetroVisions-Toronto-stumbling-six-years-after-huge-mergers/stories/200409200125] Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, &quot;Six Years After Amalgamation&quot; Jeffery Cohen, September 20th, 2004 &lt;http://www.post-gazette.com/frontpage/2004/09/20/MetroVisions-Toronto-stumbling-six-years-after-huge-mergers/stories/200409200125&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  
This amalgamation became especially important during the 2010 election as Rob Ford primarily represented the interests of the pre-amalgamation districts, or the suburbs.  Rob Ford won all the suburban wards while the downtown wards (mostly the Old City of Toronto) voted for George Smitherman, the leading opposition candidate to Ford&lt;ref name=&quot;How Toronto Voted For Mayor in 2010&quot;&gt;[http://torontoist.com/2010/10/which_wards_voted_for_who_for_mayor/] The Torontoist, &quot;How Toronto Voted for Mayor&quot;, David Topping, October, 28th, 2010 &lt;http://torontoist.com/2010/10/which_wards_voted_for_who_for_mayor/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  This was a sign of the suburban-urban divide that was growing in the city and would come to a head during Ford’s tumultuous mayorship.

== Transit City Plan ==
Transit City was a public transportation plan developed by then-Toronto Mayor David Miller in a partnership with the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC).  The plan was announced by Miller and TTC Chair Adam Giambrone on March 16th, 2007 &lt;ref name=&quot;Toronto Announces Transit City Plan&quot;&gt;[http://spacing.ca/toronto/2007/03/16/ttcs-announces-transit-city-plan/], Spacing &quot;Toronto Announces Transit City Plan&quot; March, 16th, 2007 &lt;http://spacing.ca/toronto/2007/03/16/ttcs-announces-transit-city-plan/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The most prominent piece of the plan was the construction of seven new light rail lines that would run a total of 76 miles all across the city.  A promotional video for Transit City can be found here. The lines detailed in the plan were:

* &quot;Etobicoke-Finch West LRT (17.9 km): from Humber College in the west, to the Finch bus/subway station at Yonge (there is no indication in the plan for the LRT to run along the hydro corridor, as hypothisized [March 15th, 2007] in the Star);
* Sheppard East LRT (13.6 km): connecting Don Mills subway station to Scarborough Town Centre and its RT station, and to the proposed Scarborough-Malvern LRT (see below). The line would operate underground for a short distance when leaving/approaching Don Mills station;
* Jane Street LRT (16.5 km): terminating at the Jane subway station at Bloor in the south and the Steeles West subway station that will be a part of the University-Spadina subway extension;
* Eglinton-Crosstown LRT (30.8 km): this line will cross the entire city starting at the airport, connecting to Mississauga Transit’s busway, and stretching across to Kennedy subway/RT station in Scarborough. Of note, the line would operate underground from Keele in the west to Laird in the east, avoiding the tight corridors of midtown Toronto;

The plan also sought to extend the Scarborough RT line, create new bus rapid transit lines as well as enhance service along 21 bus routes. These new lines and services were intended to be fully integrated into the existing transit infrastructure&lt;ref name=&quot;Transit City Bus Plan&quot;&gt;[http://www.ttc.ca/PDF/About_the_TTC/Transit_City_Bus_Plan.pdf],Transit City Bus Plan.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Transit City Proposed Bus Service Improvements&quot;&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2009/08/21/ttc_unveils_proposal_to_improve_bus_service.html],The Star &quot;Transit City Proposed Bus Service Improvements&quot; Tess Kalinowski, August, 21st, 2009 &lt;http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2009/08/21/ttc_unveils_proposal_to_improve_bus_service.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Projections for ridership on the completed network showed an annual ridership of 175 million, 75 million of which were projected be new TTC riders&lt;ref name=&quot;Huge Funding Boost to Toronto Transit&quot;&gt;[http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/04/02/mass-transit-gets-another-huge-boost-in-ontario/] The Transport Politic, &quot;Huge Funding Boost to Toronto Transit&quot; Yonah Freemark, April 2nd, 2009, &lt;http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/04/02/mass-transit-gets-another-huge-boost-in-ontario/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.
The most ambitious LRT line detailed in the Transit City plan was the Eglinton Crosstown LRT which was to be 19 miles (30.6 km) in length running east-west and connecting both existing subway lines.  The proposed alignment called for a tunnel to be built for a 10 km stretch of the line in order to not disturb the heavily developed Midtown area&lt;ref name=&quot;Huge Funding Boost to Toronto Transit&quot;&gt;[http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/04/02/mass-transit-gets-another-huge-boost-in-ontario/] The Transport Politic, &quot;Huge Funding Boost to Toronto Transit&quot; Yonah Freemark, April 2nd, 2009, &lt;http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/04/02/mass-transit-gets-another-huge-boost-in-ontario/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Move Ontario 2020 and The Big Move ===
In connection with the Transit City plan, the Government of Ontario announced their MoveOntario 2020 plan in June of 2007&lt;ref name=&quot;Move Ontario 2020 Funding Overview&quot;&gt;[http://www.metrolinx.com/en/regionalplanning/funding/overview_committed_provincial_funding.aspx] Metrolinx &quot;Provincial Funding&quot; &lt;http://www.metrolinx.com/en/regionalplanning/funding/overview_committed_provincial_funding.aspx&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  This plan echoed the ambition seen in the Toronto focused Transit City plan by calling for a total of 52 transit projects to be completed in just 13 years.  The total cost of all the projects outline in the plan totaled $17.5 billion, of which Ontario committed $11.5 billion&lt;ref name=&quot;Move Ontario 2020&quot;&gt;[http://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2007/06/moveontario-2020.html] The Office of the Premier &quot;MoveOntario 2020&quot; June 15th, 2007, &lt;http://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2007/06/moveontario-2020.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The rest of the funds were intended to come from the Government of Canada. All of the projects combined were projected to reduce the number of vehicle trips by nearly 300 million and lower carbon dioxide emissions by 10 megatonnes by 2020&lt;ref name=&quot;Move Ontario 2020&quot;&gt;[http://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2007/06/moveontario-2020.html] The Office of the Premier &quot;MoveOntario 2020&quot; June 15th, 2007, &lt;http://news.ontario.ca/opo/en/2007/06/moveontario-2020.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;. These projects were subsequently rolled into The Big Move, which was the Regional Transportation Plan for the province of Ontario.  This plan was adopted by the Metrolinx Board in 2008.  This plan also involved $750 million in immediate funding deemed “Quick Wins” which was focused on transit investments that would be in service within five years&lt;ref name=&quot;Move Ontario 2020 Interactive Appendix&quot;&gt;[http://www.metrolinx.com/thebigmove/en/interactive/appendixd.pdf] Metrolinx &quot;The Big Move.

With the Toronto Transit Commission, Metrolinx, the Toronto City government, and Ontario government all on board, planning and engineering for all seven LRT lines began in earnest with construction on some lines set to begin in 2010&lt;ref name=&quot;Ontario Pledges 3 Billion to Mass Transit&quot;&gt;[http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/03/27/ontario-pledges-3-billion-to-mass-transit/] The Transport Politic &quot;Ontario Pledges $3 Billion to Mass Transit&quot; Yonah Freemark, March 17th 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
In late March 2009 the Ontario government dedicated an additional $3 billion dollars to transit in Toronto as part of a larger $27.5 billion dollar recession-fighting infrastructure stimulus package&lt;ref name=&quot;Ontario Pledges 3 Billion to Mass Transit&quot;&gt;[http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/03/27/ontario-pledges-3-billion-to-mass-transit/] The Transport Politic &quot;Ontario Pledges $3 Billion to Mass Transit&quot; Yonah Freemark, March 17th 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The $3 billion was not earmarked specifically for any of the Transit City projects, which were still seeking dedicated funding at the time, however then-Mayor was positive that some of the money would be going towards these important projects&lt;ref name=&quot;McGuinty Makes Nice&quot;&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/mcguinty-makes-nice-with-miller-offering-9-billion-for-transit/article1150890/] The Globe and Mail &quot;McGuinty makes nice with Miller, offering $9-billion for transit&quot; Jeff Gray, April 10t, 2009 &lt;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/mcguinty-makes-nice-with-miller-offering-9-billion-for-transit/article1150890/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In trying to keep the Transit City projects moving forward, the Ontario government began to dedicate funding to specific projects so that they could begin construction by 2010, as some of the projects were in the final stages of engineering. On April 1st, 2009 the Ontario government dedicated $7.2 billion to help move certain Transit City projects forward and an additional $1.8 billion for a bus rapid transit line that would have a dedicated bus lane on Highway 7 and extend into the York region&lt;ref name=&quot;McGuinty Makes Nice&quot;&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/mcguinty-makes-nice-with-miller-offering-9-billion-for-transit/article1150890/] The Globe and Mail &quot;McGuinty makes nice with Miller, offering $9-billion for transit&quot; Jeff Gray, April 10t, 2009 &lt;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/mcguinty-makes-nice-with-miller-offering-9-billion-for-transit/article1150890/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The largest portion of the $7.2 billion, $4.6 billion, was dedicated to the Eglinton Avenue, which was a central piece of the Transit City plan&lt;ref name=&quot;Mass Transit Gets Another Huge Boost&quot;&gt;[http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/04/02/mass-transit-gets-another-huge-boost-in-ontario/] The Transport Politic &quot;Mass Transit Gets Another Huge Boost in Ontario&quot; Yonah Freemark, April 2nd, 2009 &lt;http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2009/04/02/mass-transit-gets-another-huge-boost-in-ontario/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  This line was intended to be partially tunneled and would serve to connect both subway lines east-west across the city.  The line was projected to carry nearly 50 million passengers annually by 2021 and at the time it was scheduled to be completed by 2016. Another portion, $1.2 billion, was dedicated to the Etobicoke-Finch West LRT Line which would serve as an east-west connection in the northern sections of the city&lt;ref name=&quot;McGuinty Makes Nice&quot;&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/mcguinty-makes-nice-with-miller-offering-9-billion-for-transit/article1150890/] The Globe and Mail &quot;McGuinty makes nice with Miller, offering $9-billion for transit&quot; Jeff Gray, April 10t, 2009 &lt;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/mcguinty-makes-nice-with-miller-offering-9-billion-for-transit/article1150890/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Furthermore, $1.4 billion would be allocated to renovating and expanding the Scarborough RT line.  This expansion was set to be completed by 2015 and would greatly improve transit connections in the northeastern portions of the Toronto region.
This announcement of additional funding for transit in Toronto came on the heels of major restructuring of the Metrolinx board.  Metrolinx, the Toronto area transportation committee ran by the Ontario government had originally been comprised of elected officials.  The Ontario Premier, Dalton McGuinty, dissolved the 11-member board and created a new 15 member board consisted of private sector experts.  The massive change in the board was met with harsh word by then-Toronto mayor David Miller but once the additional $7.2 billion of dedicated funding was announced, the issue was quickly resolved&lt;ref name=&quot;Construction Starts on Sheppard East LRT&quot;&gt;[http://news.ontario.ca/mto/en/2009/12/construction-starts-on-the-sheppard-east-light-rail-project.html] Ministry of Transportation &quot;Construction Starts on the Sheppard East Light Rail Project&quot; December, 21st, 2009 &lt;http://news.ontario.ca/mto/en/2009/12/construction-starts-on-the-sheppard-east-light-rail-project.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.

As the engineering and planning processes were underway, additional funding for other lines was sought from the Government of Canada in order to keep the projects on schedule.  The funding came in May 2009 for the Shepard East LRT.  This funding came through a federal-provincial partnership between the Ontario government and the Canadian government.  The Ontario government committed to spending $633 million with the addition third, $333 million, coming from the Canadian government&lt;ref name=&quot;Construction Starts on Sheppard East LRT&quot;&gt;[http://news.ontario.ca/mto/en/2009/12/construction-starts-on-the-sheppard-east-light-rail-project.html] Ministry of Transportation &quot;Construction Starts on the Sheppard East Light Rail Project&quot; December, 21st, 2009 &lt;http://news.ontario.ca/mto/en/2009/12/construction-starts-on-the-sheppard-east-light-rail-project.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Construction Begins ===
Following the commitment of funds from both the Ontario and Canadian governments, construction on the first LRT line could begin.  The Sheppard East LRT Line began construction on December 21st, 2009 at the Agincourt GO station&lt;ref name=&quot;Construction Starts on Sheppard East LRT&quot;&gt;[http://news.ontario.ca/mto/en/2009/12/construction-starts-on-the-sheppard-east-light-rail-project.html] Ministry of Transportation &quot;Construction Starts on the Sheppard East Light Rail Project&quot; December, 21st, 2009 &lt;http://news.ontario.ca/mto/en/2009/12/construction-starts-on-the-sheppard-east-light-rail-project.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  With the newly dedicated funding from both the provincial and federal governments, the project was set to be completed by September, 2013.  This line was intended to replace the Scarborough East bus line and would connect the Sheppard Subway Line, VIVA bus service, and future planned transit lines.

== Rob Ford and Transit City ==

=== Rob Ford's New Plan ===
When David Miller decided not to run for another term as Toronto mayor in the 2010 election, the field of candidates grew.  One of the most promising candidates at the time was Rob Ford, who was city councilman at the time.  During the 2010 campaign, transit and transportation had been a hotly contested issue.  Nearly all of the candidates came out with transportation plans and new transit plans that would change some of the new transit lines detailed in the Transit City, Big Move, and MoveOntario 2020 plans.  Rob Ford’s plan, which was released via YouTube months after his opponents had released their plans, called for the extension of the Sheppard subway line instead of the construction of the Sheppard East LRT line&lt;ref name=&quot;Rob Ford Focuses on Subways&quot;&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rob-ford-transit-plan-focuses-on-subways-roads/article1699455/] The Globe and Mail &quot;Rob Ford Transit Plan Focuses on Subways and Roads&quot; Anna Mehler Paperny, August 23rd, 2012 &lt;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rob-ford-transit-plan-focuses-on-subways-roads/article1699455/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  His plan also called for $50 million to be spent on a ravine and trail based bicycle network throughout the city as well as $5 million for bike lanes on some major arterials.  In total, his plan was set to cost $4.8 billion and would focus on building subways instead of LRT, and eliminating streetcars in the downtown in order to reduce traffic congestion&lt;ref name=&quot;Rob Ford Focuses on Subways&quot;&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rob-ford-transit-plan-focuses-on-subways-roads/article1699455/] The Globe and Mail &quot;Rob Ford Transit Plan Focuses on Subways and Roads&quot; Anna Mehler Paperny, August 23rd, 2012 &lt;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rob-ford-transit-plan-focuses-on-subways-roads/article1699455/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  His plan relied on raising money from private partners, although none were identified, and on renegotiating $3.7 billion from Queens Park that had originally been committed to the Transit City plan&lt;ref name=&quot;Rob Ford Says Scrap Streetcars&quot;&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2010/09/08/scrap_streetcars_for_subways_ford_says.html] The Star &quot;Scrap the Streetcars Says Rob Ford&quot; Tess Kalinowski September 8th, 2010 &lt;http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2010/09/08/scrap_streetcars_for_subways_ford_says.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  His plan also did not take into account that millions of dollars in penalties that the City would have to pay in order to stop construction on the Sheppard East LRT Line as well as the millions of dollars that had already been spent on the planning and engineering of the seven LRT lines specified in the Transit City plan&lt;ref name=&quot;Rob Ford Says Scrap Streetcars&quot;&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2010/09/08/scrap_streetcars_for_subways_ford_says.html] The Star &quot;Scrap the Streetcars Says Rob Ford&quot; Tess Kalinowski September 8th, 2010 &lt;http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2010/09/08/scrap_streetcars_for_subways_ford_says.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  The budget chief remarked after hearing of the plans that, “Subways get built with intergovernmental co-operation.  They don’t get built with magic beans”&lt;ref name=&quot;Rob Ford Says Scrap Streetcars&quot;&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2010/09/08/scrap_streetcars_for_subways_ford_says.html] The Star &quot;Scrap the Streetcars Says Rob Ford&quot; Tess Kalinowski September 8th, 2010 &lt;http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2010/09/08/scrap_streetcars_for_subways_ford_says.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Rob Ford Gets Elected ===
Rob Ford was elected as Toronto’s 64th mayor on October 24th, 2010 with 47.1% of the vote&lt;ref name=&quot;Rob Ford Elected Mayor of Toronto&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rob-ford-elected-mayor-of-toronto-1.870381] CBC News &quot;Rob Ford Elected Mayor of Toronto&quot; October 26th, 2010. &lt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rob-ford-elected-mayor-of-toronto-1.870381&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  He primarily won in the suburban districts and lost badly to Smitherman in the downtown districts, as shown below. 
This divide between the inner-city and the suburbs is due in large part to the amalgamation of 1998, in which 6 different municipalities were united into what is now the City of Toronto.

=== War Against Transit City ===
On the first day of being in office, Ford declared the Transit City plan to be dead&lt;ref name=&quot;Rob Ford Transit City Over&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rob-ford-transit-city-is-over-1.926388] CBC News &quot;Rob Ford: 'Transit City is Over'&quot; December 1st, 2010&lt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/rob-ford-transit-city-is-over-1.926388&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  In declaring the end of the Transit City plan, Ford angered much of the city council and the Ontario Premier, Dalton McGuinty.  As his term moved on, Ford developed a proposal to have a majority of the financing, design, and development of the Sheppard subway extension come from private parties&lt;ref name=&quot;Rob Ford Floats Private Funding For Plan&quot;&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rob-ford-floats-private-funding-plan-for-sheppard-subway/article566757/] The Globe and Mail &quot;Rob Ford Floats Private Funding Plan for Sheppard Subway&quot; Kelly Grant, Feb. 16, 2011&lt;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rob-ford-floats-private-funding-plan-for-sheppard-subway/article566757/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. This proposal was met with heavy opposition due to the reliance on tax-increment financing and because it would halt construction on the Sheppard East LRT line, which began in December 2009.  Eventually, the construction of the Sheppard East LRT line was put on hold, which caused the city to have to pay nearly $49 million in penalties and alter a $777 million contract with Bombardier which was intended to purchase 185 LRT vehicles&lt;ref name=&quot;Toronto Must Pay to Cancel LRT&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-must-pay-at-least-49m-to-cancel-lrt-plan-1.1096805] CBC News &quot;Toronto Must Pay At least $49 Million to Cancel LRT Plan&quot; March 31st, 2011 &lt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-must-pay-at-least-49m-to-cancel-lrt-plan-1.1096805&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  Through much of 2011, Rob Ford fought against any Transit City plans that included LRT to move forward and he was able to halt any plans Transit City projects from moving forward as he pushed for his own plan to be adopted and implemented by the city council.  He signed an agreement with the Ontario government that did away with the Finch light rail line, changed the original plans for the Eglinton Line to be completely underground, and continued to promise a Sheppard Subway line instead of the surface light rail line&lt;ref name=&quot;Torontos Transit City Back In Play&quot;&gt;[http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2012/04/25/torontos-transit-city-back-in-play/] The Transport Politic &quot;Torontos Transit City Plan Back In Play&quot; Yonah Freemark, April 25th, 2012&lt;http://www.thetransportpolitic.com/2012/04/25/torontos-transit-city-back-in-play/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

Eventually, as details came to light about Rob Ford and his not so well thought out plans the city council, who had voted along with Rob Ford until now, rebelled&lt;ref name=&quot;Karen Stintz Bold Move&quot;&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2012/01/30/karen_stintzs_bold_moves_on_transit_draw_admirers_and_critics.html] The Star &quot;Karen Stintz's Bold Moves on Transit Draw Admirers and Critics&quot; Tess Kalinowski, January 30th, 2012.&lt;http://www.thestar.com/news/city_hall/2012/01/30/karen_stintzs_bold_moves_on_transit_draw_admirers_and_critics.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

Although this decision meant that the Transit City projects would finally be built, the chaos caused by Ford effectively pushed the completion of all the lines back four years later than they were originally projected to be completed&lt;ref name=&quot;Rob Ford Unveils Focus on Subways&quot;&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rob-fords-transit-plan-unveiled-focus-on-subways/article20318514/] The Globe and Mail &quot;Rob Ford's Transit Plan Unveiled; Focuses on Subways&quot; Oliver Moore, September 3rd, 2014&lt;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rob-fords-transit-plan-unveiled-focus-on-subways/article20318514/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Rob Ford Today ===
Despite his complications with drug and alcohol abuse, as well as odd behavior, Ford has remained as Toronto mayor. Ford has continued to push for new subway lines despite construction of the Transit City LRT lines being well underway.  He released a new $9 billion transit plan on September 3rd of 2014 in which he outlined new subway lines all throughout the city&lt;ref name=&quot;Rob Ford Unveils Focus on Subways&quot;&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rob-fords-transit-plan-unveiled-focus-on-subways/article20318514/] The Globe and Mail &quot;Rob Ford's Transit Plan Unveiled; Focuses on Subways&quot; Oliver Moore, September 3rd, 2014&lt;http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/toronto/rob-fords-transit-plan-unveiled-focus-on-subways/article20318514/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  Although he recently withdrew from the race after an abdominal tumor was found to be malignant, his brother Doug Ford is continuing the fight for new subway lines&lt;ref name=&quot;Rob Ford Withdraws from Mayoral Race&quot;&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/12/world/toronto-mayor-ford-withdraws/], CNN &quot;Rob Ford Withdraws from Mayoral Race&quot; Greg Botelho, Susanna Capelouto, September 14th, 2014.&lt;http://www.cnn.com/2014/09/12/world/toronto-mayor-ford-withdraws/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Future of Transit in Toronto ==
The current Transit Service Improvement Plan dates from April 2008 and focuses on cost-effective service which provides the highest mobility to Torontonians. It does not, however, include the building of any subway or LRT lines[45]. The Toronto Transit Commission’s Ridership Growth Strategy is 2003, however, remarks on the City’s plan of Continuous Subway Expansion[46]. The document does not include any new rapid rail lines, only extensions of the lines which existed in 2003. 

Transit in Toronto is currently in a state of flux. The current planning documents are up to 11 years old and are due for revision. The city of Toronto is currently in the midst of a mayoral election race. Voting will take place on October 27th, 2014. There are three candidates-- Olivia Chow, John Tory, and Doug Ford--each with very different plans for expanding the transit system in Toronto. A recent poll of residents in Toronto identifies transit as the number 1 issue for 49% of residents [47]
=== Rob and Doug Ford ===
As of this writing Doug Ford is just beginning his campaign following his brother’s withdrawal from the Mayoral Race. He has not come forth with his own transit plan, but he has long been a vocal supporter of Rob Ford’s ambitious Subway plan for Toronto, and it is expected that he will adopt this plan as his own. Further discussion in this section refers to the plan laid out by Rob Ford.

Regarding the financing of his $9 billion (CAD) plan, Ford remarked “I have funding options in place”. His options included relying on other levels of government, public-private partnerships, sales of assets and air-rights over stations, and tax-increment financing[47]. Further Ford’s estimated cost of the Sheppard subway ($1.8 billion CAD) departs significantly from the expert-quoted $2.7 - $3.7 billion (CAD). [48]

This plan has been met with much criticism from other candidates for Mayor. 
=== Olivia Chow- &quot;Moving People Now&quot; ===
Chow claims that her plan will save taxpayers $1.6 billion (CAD) over the other candidates’ plans, but it facing opposition from residents who are unfamiliar with LRT. Toronto currently has only subway and commuter rail, and some residents are wary as to LRT’s ability to perform in a harsh Ontario winter. [49] [50]

=== John Tory- &quot;OneToronto&quot; ===
John Tory’s transit plan focuses on extending rail service outside the downtown core of Toronto. [52] This plan will be funded through the controversial method of Tax Increment Financing, along with, funding from the Provincial and Federal Governments. The City of Toronto would be responsible for one-third of the capital costs. [53]

Tory’s plan for increasing transit in the Toronto core is to run “all-day, two-way, frequent service” on existing rails within the city. The existing rails are currently in use as GO lines, providing one-directional rush hour commuter rail service [54]. His plan terms this mode “surface subway”

[[File:TransMilenio Bogota Map.png|thumb|TransMilenio Bogota Map]]

Former Mayor Enrique Peñalosa spearheaded a dramatic overhaul of Bogotá’s transit system, replacing a large group of poorly coordinated informal bus lines with a new, dedicated-lane bus rapid transit system. This BRT system, known as the TransMilenio, has led to dramatic increases in transit ridership and created a tangible impact, shifting the perception of transit away from the idea that it was “only for the poor.” Despite widespread acknowledgement that TransMilenio was a huge improvement over pre-existing conditions, over the past years there have been rising complaints on several issues, including system overcrowding, fare equity and gentrification along the system corridors, which has affected Peñalosa’s reelection campaign. While subsequent mayors have continued to oversee the system expansion, there has been increasing political support for a subway system in the city. This option has been dismissed multiple times in the past due its low cost-effectiveness. Nonetheless, it has been getting more public attention, with some of the recent Mayors supporting the idea that a subway is a key tool for Bogotá to become a world class city and attract international investment.

== Bogotá, Colombia ==

At 8.2 million, Bogotá is the biggest city in Colombia. It is densely populated and suffers from severe traffic congestion. By the 1990’s, Bogota’s public bus transportation had an average speed of 5 km/hr during peak traffic, and 10 km/hr during non-peak times. Privately-controlled transit systems created further passenger frustrations related to pricing. In 1999, after a plan for implementing subways to increase system capacity and travel times was rejected by the New National Government, Mayor Peñalosa announced a Bus Rapid Transit system alternative&lt;ref&gt;https://www.esmap.org/sites/esmap.org/files/CS_Bogota_020310_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The TransMilenio System ==

&quot;An advanced city is not a place where the poor move about in cars, rather it’s where even the rich use public transportation.&quot; – Former Bogotá Mayor Enrique Peñalosa. 

Prior to the new millennium, Bogotá, Colombia was well known for the dysfunctionality of its mass transit system. The system, which was largely informal, consisted solely of buses which were operated primarily by individual driver/owners. These owners affiliated with large transportation companies in exchange for access to the licenses that would allow them to operate on city streets. These licenses were widely understood to have been overly abundant and their allocation was frequently suspected of linkage to governmental corruption. Once licensed, bus drivers were given free rein to design their own routes to maximize personal profitability. The result was a system where almost every route went through the downtown central business district in order to have access to the most passengers. Additionally, these buses did not ascribe to the traditional approach of servicing bus stops but rather stopped wherever they feasibly could in order to increase ridership and boost profits, a dynamic that was dubbed “penny wars” (guerras del centavo). These approaches resulted in extreme congestion issues, especially in the central business district, and the plethora of buses greatly degraded the city’s environment and the quality of service.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gilbert&quot; &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1997, mayoral candidate Enrique Peñalosa campaigned on a platform of transportation reform. Throughout the last four decades, there had been many calls for the installation of a heavy rail system in Bogotá. Due to the extremely high cost of rail infrastructure and Colombia’s status as a developing country, the construction of the system was always deemed financially imprudent. Inspired by the bus rapid transit system of Curitiba, Brazil, Peñalosa endeavored instead to craft a system of dedicated busways that would criss-cross the city and provide the same type of mobility benefits of a metro system at a fraction of the cost. In working to implement this new system, Peñalosa had to appease or conquer many entrenched transportation interests, including several that were widely believed to be corrupt or even violently criminal. Private transportation providers were convinced to participate in TransMilenio with the understanding that the program would be profitable for them as well. TransMilenio runs with no public subsidy aside from the initial capital costs associated with laying out the infrastructure, which are funded by both the City and National governments. Several private bus companies operate the buses that service TransMilenio’s lines, but must do so with buses and service standards that meet government specifications &lt;ref name = &quot;Gilbert&quot; &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.
TransMilenio began operations in 2000 and was extremely well received by the public during its first years of service. More recently, however, complaints have mounted relating to the quality, comfort, and affordability of TransMilenio. Private bus operators, seeking to maximize fare revenue, run buses at the highest capacity so as not to squander any usable bus space. This results in suboptimal travel experiences with riders being forced to stand packed together in tight quarters even during non-peak hours. There are also concerns that the pricing of TransMilenio buses is out of touch with the needs of the very poor. TransMilenio’s tickets include free embedded transfers which result in cost savings of complex multi-bus journeys. Non-transferring trips, however, are more affordable on the pre-existing informal bus system, and many low-income residents eschew TransMilenio for these other options. Finally, in the public imagery of many citizens and politicians, a BRT system is by definition an inherently inferior system when compared to other, fixed-rail options. For these sectors, Bogota’s future as a global city depends on eventually making the investment in rail infrastructure. The current Mayor, Gustavo Petro, has indicated a desire to build subway infrastructure in addition to continuing the expansion of the TransMilenio system &lt;ref name = &quot;Bassett&quot; &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Bus Rapid Transit Systems ===

Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) systems offer several potential benefits over traditional bus transit systems, including increases in capacity, safety and security, reliability and accessibility, and decreased travel times&lt;ref name = &quot;NBRTI&quot; &gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. BRT systems often have facility and bus fleet improvements which capture “choice” riders and enhance the image of the transit service. Largely because of these benefits, a well-designed BRT system has the ability to increase overall ridership and lower cost per passenger-type system efficiency measures.

==== TransMilenio BRT ====

TransMilenio employs several BRT elements to both enhance public perception, increase system cost efficiency, and improve the accessibility of Bogota’s many residents. TM includes two types of buses: longer 60ft. articulated red BRT vehicles and conventional 40ft. green “feeder” buses. Both are branded distinctively with the “TransMilenio” logo and look clean and modern. Green TransMilenio buses operate as feeder buses to the main BRT corridors. Feeder buses operate on mixed traffic local roads and are free to ride. These feeder buses operate as collectors, and bring riders into areas with larger BRT stations. There are three types of stations in the TransMilenio system: Terminals, Intermediate Integration stations, and standard stations. Feeder routes pick up riders from standard bus stations, or stops and bring them to larger Intermediate or Terminal stations. Terminal stations are located at either end of BRT corridors, with Intermediate stations allowing transfers from feeder buses to BRT lines in between the two Terminal stations. 
TransMilenio benefits from a large bicycle network, which acts as a feeder for the BRT lines. Many of the larger BRT stations include free, monitored bicycle parking. Gil Peñalosa, brother to Enrique, estimates that for every 25 people who ride their bicycle to the BRT terminal, one feeder bus could be taken off the road&lt;ref&gt;(http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10063/1141/thesis.pdf?sequence=1)&lt;/ref&gt;. Since feeder buses in themselves generate no revenue, the cost savings from a well-used bicycle network have tremendous cost-savings potential. 
Intermediate and terminal stations have off-board payment systems. Payment systems, managed by two private concessionaires, offer a variety of “contactless” cards with fare reductions for disability, frequent customers, and university students (from TransMilenio website, translated by GoogleTranslate). Cards can be reloaded from fare machines outside stations and in a mix of commercial stores and supermarkets. Contactless fare payment cards can be validated upon entering the station at turnstiles. Customers must pass through turnstiles in order to access station platforms. Off-board payment systems such as these offer huge travel times savings as compared to systems with on-board payment. Fares are flat-fares and do not vary by service or distance traveled, allowing utilization by Bogota’s poorer residents.
BRT stations are located in the middle of thoroughfares and are accessed by elevated pedestrian walkways. Each station has four boarding platforms in either direction, and all stations have “overtaking” lanes to reduce unnecessary dwell time and allow for “express” (limited or skip-stop) buses to pass the loading queue&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chinabrt.org/en/cities/bogota.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;. BRT buses have 3 sets of doors which open automatically upon reaching a boarding platform. This quick automatic system allows for more passengers to get on and off the bus in the shortest amount of time. Raised-platforms and low-floor buses allow easier access for disabled and elderly passengers. 
The system is monitored from a control center with workstations capable of monitoring 80 articulated buses at a time. Each BRT bus has a “logic system” that connects with GPS, the odometer and door opening systems to report the location of the bus every 6 seconds. Workstation employees are able to see these locations on a larger system schematic screen, and have voice and data communication channels with bus operators and system supervisors. 
Most BRT vehicles are diesel-fueled, though plans to incorporate hybrid and electric vehicles by 2024 have been announced by Siemens&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siemens.com/press/pool/de/events/2014/infrastructure-cities/2014-06-CCLA/bogota-climate-close-up.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; to further environmental and air pollution goals. 

==== Implementation of TransMilenio ====

Phase I began operation in December 2000. By March 2002, there were three operating trunk corridors (41 km) and seven feeder zones (309 km). The bus fleet consisted of 470 articulated buses and 235 conventional feeder buses. There were four terminal stations, four intermediate stations, and 53 standard stations, with 27 new pedestrian overpasses. Phase I had four trunk line concessionaires, five feeder zone contractors (operating in seven zones) and one fare concessionaire. Total infrastructure costs were $240 million USD ($5.9 million USD per km)&lt;ref&gt;Institute for Transportation &amp; Development Policy, TransMilenio Case Study. https://go.itdp.org/display/ADBdemo/TransMilenio&lt;/ref&gt;. Financing was provided by a 25% local fuel surcharge, which covered 46% of the total infrastructure cost. A national government grant provided another 20%, a World Bank loan another 6%, and local funds covered the remaining 28%.

Phase II was completed in 2006, and grew the system to 142 stations with 11 BRT corridors. Phase II included an additional 64 km of dedicated busways, and grew the total bus fleet to 1,215 BRT buses and 515 feeder buses. Additional infrastructure cost was $545 million ($13 million USD per km) and was largely funded by the national government and the local fuel surcharge. 

==== Impact ====

TransMilenio implementation had numerous impacts on ridership, travel times, adjacent property values and the environment. The system currently averages 1.65 million rides per day, and can transport 37,000 riders per hour during peak periods in each direction&lt;ref&gt;https://go.itdp.org/display/ADBdemo/TransMilenio&lt;/ref&gt;. Peak speeds range from 16-30 km/hr, with “express” buses covering more distance in less time. Average travel times for BRT passengers decreased by 32%. Property values were estimated to have increased by 15-20% for property within 1km of stations. Sulfur dioxide levels have been significantly decreased (44% reduction) and it is estimated that 9% of car owners have shifted from driving to taking public transit following the implementation of TransMilenio.

== List of Actors ==

===  Mayors of Bogotá ===

The mayor of Bogotá presides over nearly 20 percent of the Colombian population and consequently is one of the most powerful figures in Colombia. Colombian law limits mayors to three-year consecutive terms, which means politicians avoid fomenting their predecessors’ initiatives, knowing their rivals are waiting in the wings. &lt;ref name= &quot;Alex&quot;&gt;Hutchinson, Alex. 2011. 'Transmilenio: The Good, The Bus And The Ugly'. Blog. The City Fix. http://thecityfix.com/blog/transmilenio-the-good-the-bus-and-the-ugly/.&lt;/ref&gt; Leadership played a major role in the success of Colombia’s BRT developments. In Bogotá, Mayors Antanas Mockus and Enrique Peñalosa made transportation a key objective of their administrations. &lt;ref name = &quot;CAP&quot; &gt;Center for Clean Air Policy. 2012. Case Study: Colombia’s Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Development And Expansion. Center for Clean Air Policy.&lt;/ref&gt; 
==== Antanas Mockus (1995-1997) ====

The initial groundwork for TransMilenio was laid by Mockus, whose program was to raise consciousness about public interactions. Mockus began an important change in Bogotá's civic culture with his Cultura Ciudadana (Citizen Culture) campaign, which encouraged civic behavior and strived to create a sense of belonging for the inhabitants of the city. Part of his curriculum involved traffic etiquette and this led to changed attitudes about the relationship between motor vehicles and pedestrians. This in turn set the stage for increased investment in public transit and non-motorized infrastructure.&lt;ref name = &quot;CAP&quot;&gt;Center for Clean Air Policy. 2012. Case Study: Colombia’s Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Development And Expansion. Center for Clean Air Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Enrique Peñalosa (1998-2000) ====

The next administration, under Enrique Peñalosa introduced a comprehensive effort to transform the way residents traveled around the city. There were three main pillars of the transformation: (a) education on public awareness of transit and nonmotorized travel options, (b) planning and constructing Bus Rapid Transit and bike infrastructure, and (c)  restrictions on automobile use.&lt;ref name = &quot;CAP&quot; &gt;Center for Clean Air Policy. 2012. Case Study: Colombia’s Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Development And Expansion. Center for Clean Air Policy.&lt;/ref&gt;

Peñalosa was also convinced by experience in Curitiba and Quito that the private sector should own and operate the TransMilenio buses. He wanted the system to run without an operating subsidy. He also had to ensure that the local bus companies in Bogotá would participate in the project.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gilbert&quot; &gt;Gilbert, Alan. 2008. 'Bus Rapid Transit: Is Transmilenio A Miracle Cure?'. Transport Reviews 28 (4): 439-467. doi:10.1080/01441640701785733.&lt;/ref&gt; His administration received criticism for negotiating with organized crime groups linked to the old bus operators, but Peñalosa contends that drastic action was needed to overhaul the transit system. In Peñalosa's eyes, Transmilenio was perhaps the ultimate poverty alleviator, since the poor cannot afford cars. He left office with high approval ratings, but did not win for his 2007 reelection campaign due to the popularity decline of TransMilenio associated with maintenance and overcrowding issues. &lt;ref name = &quot;Bassett&quot;&gt;Bassett, T. E., and A. Marpillero-Colomina. 2012. 'Sustaining Mobility: Bus Rapid Transit And The Role Of Local Politics In Bogota'. Latin American Perspectives 40 (2): 135-145. doi:10.1177/0094582x12468867.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Antanas Mockus (2001-2003), Luis Eduardo Garzón (2004-2007) ====

Mockus and Garzón continued the TransMilenio project by planning and beginning to implement its second stage (Phase II). They struggled with the issues of overcrowding and efficient service provision that emerged as the TransMilenio system grew and became increasingly successful. &lt;ref name = &quot;Bassett&quot;&gt;Bassett, T. E., and A. Marpillero-Colomina. 2012. 'Sustaining Mobility: Bus Rapid Transit And The Role Of Local Politics In Bogota'. Latin American Perspectives 40 (2): 135-145. doi:10.1177/0094582x12468867.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Samuel Moreno Rojas (2008-2011) - suspended  ====

Rojas' very well-received platform centered on abandoning expansion of the TransMilenio  and constructing a subway system, at a cost of at least 20 times that of BRT. &lt;ref name = &quot; Bassett&quot;&gt; Bassett, T. E., and A. Marpillero-Colomina. 2012. 'Sustaining Mobility: Bus Rapid Transit And The Role Of Local Politics In Bogota'. Latin American Perspectives 40 (2): 135-145. doi:10.1177/0094582x12468867.&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents like Rojas have attacked TransMilenio as Peñalosa’s “pet project” while proposing subway as the only solution to overcrowding, particularly on the “Septima” corridor that is part of TransMilenio Phase III. &lt;ref name= &quot;NBRTI&quot;&gt;National Bus Rapid Transit Institute (NBRTI). 2007. Report On South American Bus Rapid Transit Field Visits: Tracking The Evolution Of The Transmilenio Model. U.S. Department of Transportation.&lt;/ref&gt; Rojas argued that the development of rail transit would would propel Bogota to a new level in its development and sophistication with transit infrastructure comparable to London, New York, Paris or Tokyo, and thus attract international capital. Rojas resigned after charges for negligence in overseeing public contracts. &lt;ref name = &quot;Bassett&quot;&gt; Bassett, T. E., and A. Marpillero-Colomina. 2012. 'Sustaining Mobility: Bus Rapid Transit And The Role Of Local Politics In Bogota'. Latin American Perspectives 40 (2): 135-145. doi:10.1177/0094582x12468867.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gustavo Petro (2012-today) ====

The current Mayor originally outlined his commitment to moving forward with the original expansion plan for TransMilenio without laying out a specific strategy for its execution. &lt;ref name =&quot;Bassett&quot;&gt;Bassett, T. E., and A. Marpillero-Colomina. 2012. 'Sustaining Mobility: Bus Rapid Transit And The Role Of Local Politics In Bogota'. Latin American Perspectives 40 (2): 135-145. doi:10.1177/0094582x12468867.&lt;/ref&gt; However the new administration has also announced that it will push for construction of the first subway line to start in 2015.

===  Government ===
==== City Government ====

The institutional, regulatory and business issues involving BRT have been explored by some experts and identified as critical to the overall success of the project or system.&lt;ref name = &quot;NBRTI&quot;&gt;National Bus Rapid Transit Institute (NBRTI). 2007. Report On South American Bus Rapid Transit Field Visits: Tracking The Evolution Of The Transmilenio Model. U.S. Department of Transportation.&lt;/ref&gt; The city government owns the routes and rents the right to contracted private bus operators for a specific length of time, usually seven years. The city government is responsible for the provision and maintenance of the trunk line busways, stations, terminals and other complementary infrastructure, such as necessary road works and the control center.&lt;ref name = &quot; Cracknell&quot;&gt; Cracknell, John. 2003. Transmilenio Busway-Based Mass Transit, Bogotá, Colombia. The World Bank&lt;/ref&gt; In the decade following TransMilenio opening, maintenance has sometimes been neglectful as mayors pursued other budgetary priorities, thus causing this infrastructure to suffer and damaging the system's reputation.  &lt;ref name = &quot;Bassett&quot;&gt;Bassett, T. E., and A. Marpillero-Colomina. 2012. 'Sustaining Mobility: Bus Rapid Transit And The Role Of Local Politics In Bogota'. Latin American Perspectives 40 (2): 135-145. doi:10.1177/0094582x12468867.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== National Government ====

Collaboration between the national and local government was crucial to the success of TransMilenio, specifically the relationship regarding the 70/30 financing rule. This established a system where the national government helped with planning and orientation plus financing, and the local government responded with interest and commitment to develop the project, along with their share of financing.&lt;ref name = &quot;CAP&quot;&gt; Center for Clean Air Policy. 2012. Case Study: Colombia’s Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) Development And Expansion. Center for Clean Air Policy.
&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the funding for BRT comes from loans by the Development Bank of Latin-America (CAF in Spanish), the Inter-American Development Bank (BID), and the World Bank.&lt;ref name = &quot;NBRTI&quot;&gt;National Bus Rapid Transit Institute (NBRTI). 2007. Report On South American Bus Rapid Transit Field Visits: Tracking The Evolution Of The Transmilenio Model. U.S. Department of Transportation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== National Urban Transport Program (NTUP) ====

The success of TransMilenio helped spur support for the development of a national plan for Integrated Mass Transit Systems (IMTS) that would replicate the Bogotá example in other parts of the country. The National Urban Transport Program (NUTP) offers funding and support to cities with populations of over 600,000 inhabitants to develop Integrated Mass Transit Systems and cities with populations between 300,000 and 600,000 to develop Strategic Public Transportation Systems (SPTS). This legislation resulted in the planned extension of BRT projects in 8 other cities.&lt;ref name = &quot;CAP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Transmilenio S.A. ====
The TransMilenio system is managed by a public transit authority, Transmilenio, S.A., which awards contracts to private bus companies on a competitive basis. The agency is responsible for the busway and station infrastructure while different private companies buy and operate the buses, provide the drivers and a separate company collects the fares. &lt;ref name = &quot;CAP&quot; &gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It's financed with 4% of ticket sales revenue, other charges fixed in the contracts, and income from ancillary activities, like advertising, technical assistance and consulting.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cracknell&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; There have been complaints about the competence of the agency regarding its increasingly bureaucratic and decreasing technical role since 2005. &lt;ref name = &quot;Gilbert&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Urban Development Institute (IDU) ====

The IDU is a public transportation authority in charge of the development of Bogota's public roadworks and other related infrastructure, such as pedestrian and vehicular bridges and interchange stations. It is also in charge of building, maintaining and repairing the infrastructure for TransMilenio's trunk routes. However new routes and traffic measures depends on the Secretary for Mobility. This limits the role of TransMilenio's agency. &lt;ref name = &quot;Alex&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Private sector ===

Before TransMilenio, mass transit in Bogotá was limited to privately owned public bus service, which suffered from the oversupply of bus route permits, inadequate institutional capacity, and a fractured owner/driver relationship, which resulted in fleet oversupply, low quality services and high social cost due to slow travel, high pollution, high accidents rates, and operating inefficiency. In the late 1990’s, Bogotá’s public bus transportation system was dangerous, underused, inefficient, and offered poor quality service. &lt;ref name = &quot;CAP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Traditional bus companies ====

Vehicles operating in the traditional service belong to small private investors. These investors affiliate their bus to a bus company, something required by law because bus companies are the only ones allowed to provide passenger transport services. The bus companies, therefore, do not own the bus fleet. Instead, the bus companies rent out the routes to the bus owners. &lt;ref name = &quot; Ardila&quot;&gt;Ardila, Arturo. 2005. Study of Urban Public Transport Conditions in Bogotá (Colombia). The World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt; As in many cities of Latin America, the traditional bus is loosely regulated and drivers are paid by number of passengers. This encourages on-the-street competition for riders, known as “penny wars”, and low occupancies drive down fares to levels insufficient for reinvestment in vehicles and infrastructure. The vehicles tend to stop anywhere to pick up and drop off passengers, which create unpredictable congestion in mixed traffic and poor service quality.&lt;ref name = &quot;NBRTI&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The reaction of these companies to the TransMilenio proposal was strongly negative and proved to be a critical barrier to the BRT’s success. A main cause of resistance from existing bus operators was the feared loss of business. However other issues ensued such as the replacement of direct permitting allocation with a bidding process, the financial risk associated with investments in bus acquisition, and the uncertainty of the government being able to follow through with building planned infrastructure and retiring existing operators. &lt;ref name = &quot;CAP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Several methods were employed by the administration to overcome the resistance of bus operators and make them pertinent stakeholders in the planning and implementation of TransMilenio. First, the bidding process required experience in public transportation in the city as a prerequisite, which basically secured the participation of existing bus companies (and bus owners in Phase II). Second, open dialogues with transport companies were held in order to include them in the relocation of routes and the negotiations of terms and conditions of contracts. These tactics were instrumental in overcoming the initial strong resistance from existing bus operators and getting them to become shareholders in the new BRT system. &lt;ref name = &quot;CAP&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However in overcoming these barriers Transmilenio’s designers implicitly favoured large investors, something that most politicians have accepted now. And, by negotiating with the bus companies rather than the bus owners, it was left to the companies to decide whether or not to include the owners. &lt;ref name = &quot;Gilbert&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Strikes by the transport companies and protests by university students in 2006 helped alert the authorities to the problem but criticism has become particularly fierce since Mayor Garzón came to power, partly because much of the political support and finance for his party came from bus companies and owners who did not participate in the first two phases of
TransMilenio. &lt;ref name = &quot;Gilbert&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Informal buses (Pirate fleets) ====

There are at least two types of informal operators. The first are &quot;flotas&quot;, buses that used to belong to the traditional service or that resemble the buses in that service, usually with cloned license plates to avoid identification. A second type of informality are the operators that provide a service at night or in areas of the city were formal services are scarce or nonexistent. This informal service uses jitneys and other small vehicles—even small cars. Little data exists on their operation. &lt;ref name = &quot; Ardila&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

Controlled by organized crime which &quot;own&quot; routes and rent the right to use them with little or no control from the public sector.  More than 700 lines of flotas run by 68 private bus companies and more than 20,000 bus owners strangle the city due to overlapping routes and oversupply of buses.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bassett&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For years, the basic defects of the system were never rectified because official control over bus routes gave the authorities a certain political leverage and, for some officials, seemingly a source of illicit income. Bus companies also have the power to call a strike and block the main roads of the city, something that they have done quite frequently. Despite regular changes in its structure and leadership, the government agency in charge of managing transport in Bogotá has often been accused of being either corrupt or incompetent.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gilbert&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  

The flotas presented the largest obstacle for the Peñalosa administration's ability to implement the Transmilenio. &lt;ref name = &quot;Bassett&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Through cash buyouts which took flotas off the road, (Peñalosa's) government replaced them with new TransMilenio buses. Part of the buyout deal was the creation of a one-kilometer buffer surrounding the new TransMilenio route in which no flotas could operate. His administration received criticism for negotiating with organized crime groups, but Peñalosa contends that drastic action was needed to overhaul the transit system. &lt;ref name = &quot;Bassett&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bus companies after TransMilenio ====

Bus services for trunk and feeder routes are provided by the private sector working under strict controls defined in the concession contracts. The bus operators are a consortia of local transport companies associated with national and international investors and they own the buses, hire drivers and maintain the personnel. Service concessions were awarded following an open and competitive bidding process. Payments to bus operators are based on (i) the number of route kilometers produced by each trunk line operator and (ii) the number of passengers carried by the feeder buses. No minimum revenue guarantee exists. &lt;ref name = &quot;Cracknell&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The city government actively sought the participation and collaboration of the existing transport companies and operators in the new system. It was a bidding condition for the services on the three first trunk lines that existing operators should be majority shareholders. This requirement forced a fundamental change in the structure of the existing bus service supply industry. It has been reported that a large number of bus companies/operators have merged into larger companies, in which companies, other than previous bus operators, also have a share. &lt;ref name = &quot;Cracknell&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The main question, therefore, is how to involve more owners and drivers in the ownership structure when, as Víctor Raúl Martínez, the largest shareholder in the TransMilenio operating companies, points out: “the small owners don’t have enough money to invest and wait five years before receiving the profits”&lt;ref&gt;At 4 pm, the strike was dead.” Newspaper El Tiempo, 05/26/2006, http://www.eltiempo.com/archivo/documento/MAM-2039563 
&lt;/ref&gt;. During Phase I new companies were required to buy 2.7 old buses for every articulated bus that they wanted to run. The objective was to reduce the stock of old buses operating on the streets. However the replacement process has proved to be more complicated and tortuous than expected. Additionally, owners of old buses recognized their commercial asset and during Phase II they started demanding more money. As a consequence there has been a delay in putting articulated buses on some of the new routes. &lt;ref name = &quot;Gilbert&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The continued presence of old buses and the entry of illegal ones is explicable in terms of the influence of certain bus companies. There have been at least fifteen attempts to get the debate of profitability of old bus companies or the excessive number of buses operating the city through the Council's Government Commission. Bus companies have clearly been using their influence (i.e. campaign financing) over the local administration and the Ministry of Transport to sabotage the programme to scrap old buses. Because of the ‘unfair’ competition, Transmilenio is not carrying as many passengers as the current number of articulated buses can handle. Buses have remained in the garages and given that costs have increased and passenger numbers have not, the fares on Transmilenio have risen.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gilbert&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

A second problem is also linked to the demands of the transport lobby. Transmilenio was intended to transform the whole structure of the bus system. A new operating approach was needed together with a new kind of operating company. But, in order to persuade the traditional bus owners to amalgamate and form new companies, arguably too much was offered in the way of incentives, particularly in Phase I when the profits proved to be greater than had been anticipated. A modern private system should deliver profits to the operators but good regulation should ensure that the profits are not excessive. &lt;ref name = &quot;Gilbert&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Other groups ===
==== Transit Users ====

Before TransMilenio, there was in general a low public opinion of busways and bike lanes. &lt;ref name = &quot;Cracknell&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Buses have also often been excluded from the agenda for their perceived lack of efficiency (due in large part to irregular service and low vehicle speeds) and the stigma they carry as the transit mode of the poor. &lt;ref name = &quot;Bassett&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Transit users had long suffered from the way the system was organized, with a JICA Study of 1996 claiming that 72% of the city’s people spent more than ten years of their lives on a bus. &lt;ref name = &quot;Gilbert&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the obstacles and general skepticism, public transportation has become safer, more reliable and more affordable.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bassett&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; When service for TransMilenio began in 2001 public response was very positive compared to other modes of transport and received a 93% approval rating. &lt;ref name = &quot;Gilbert&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, though the general image of TransMilenio had declined among the general public, 72% of users thought that introduction of the service had improved public transport in Bogotá, a signal of recognition of its virtues but at the same time demanding a better service. &lt;ref name = &quot;Gilbert&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Car Drivers ====

For car owners, public transportation is synonymous with chaos and poverty. Peñalosa's proposals were met with strong opposition; one of the first projects his administration undertook was to reclaim the sidewalk for pedestrians by installing physical barriers to prevent cars from being parked on the sidewalk. Drivers and storeowners were outraged at being denied space to which they considered themselves entitled. &lt;ref name = &quot;Bassett&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The city currently restricts drivers with a policy known as Pico y Placa, which restricts car use depending on license plate numbers on designated days of the week. Drivers have found a way around this policy by simply buying a second car and leaving it in the garage on restriction days. A tax could has been suggested instead of this policy, which could be reinvested back in public transportation. &lt;ref name = &quot;Alex&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Low-income groups ====

Regarding the cost of travel, the system helps low income sectors in two critical ways. First, the fares are fixed whatever the length of the journey, and insofar as many of the poor live in the outskirts, most travel longer distances than other classes. As such, their journeys are being subsidized by wealthier classes who make shorter journeys. Second, passengers using the feeder network, which operates mainly in poor neighbourhoods, do not have to pay; the cost is covered through purchase of the first ticket. Hence, those who only use the corridor buses are subsidizing those in the periphery.

Nonetheless, the fare for the combined TransMilenio journey is higher than that for a single journey on the traditional buses, but still cheaper if a passenger has to make a journey on two traditional buses. The difference between Transmilenio fares and those on the traditional system is widely cited as an explanation for the slower-than-predicted rise in ridership in the past years.&lt;ref name = &quot;Gilbert&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Other ====

The success of TransMilenio has brought forth critics who question the effects of this transportation development on the city's poorest residents and its role as a gentrifying agent. Scholars and critics charge that the poor, rather than being the beneficiaries of this development and the rise in property values, are the ones who bear the cost of these policies. &lt;ref name = &quot;Bassett&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Key Related Policies ==

Enrique Peñalosa’s policy plans focused on converting urban transportation to a people-centered system rather than an auto-oriented system. Among these policies was a plan to rapidly deploy the TransMilenio BRT system. In coordination with the BRT implementation were a number of policies that discouraged personal automobile use while encouraging public transportation development&lt;ref name = &quot;Arturo&quot;&gt;Arturo Ardila and Gerhard Menckhoff, Transportation Policies in Bogata, Colombia, Building a Transportation System for the People&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Deploying a mass transportation system ===

TransMilenio is a major mass transit project. Peñalosa intended to use TransMilenio to build a bus-based mass transportation system, which could provide passengers with a more reliable and more comfortable transit service. TransMilenio was developed, operated and managed by a company named TransMilenio S.A., whose operating costs are covered by the City of Bogotáand farebox revenue&lt;ref name =&quot;Arturo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

TransMilenio was deployed along with the implementation of the Integrated Management Policy, which clarified the major objectives and orientation of the development of TransMilenio&lt;ref name = &quot;gov&quot;&gt;]http://www.transmilenio.gov.co/en/articles/integrated-management-policy&lt;/ref&gt;. TransMilenio S.A. was created to plan, manage and control the TransMilenio transportation system by providing transportation to suit transit demand from the residents of Bogotá. Among TransMilenio S.A.’s goals are that the BRT system should be efficient, safe, and financially and environmentally sustainable, in such a way to improve the wellbeing of the residents, meet regulatory requirements, and reduce pollution and accidents&lt;ref name =&quot;gov&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

A stable and standardized fare policy is a large improvement for the mass transit system. Previous to the TransMilenio, private companies set the price of fares, and prices were raised substantially during time periods with high demand. For the TransMilenio, fares are set at $0.90 US dollars for each passenger, which include transfers within the BRT TransMilenio system and transfers to other trunk lines or feeder buses. Fares support the operating costs and some of the capital costs for both buses and free feeder services and the facilities infrastructure is also supported by the fares &lt;ref name =&quot;Arturo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

Instead of completely replacing private companies with publicly-owned services, TransMilenio S.A. integrated private bus companies into the new system. To do this, TransMilenio S.A. awards contracts to private bus companies which operate buses that meet basic environmental standards. Absorbing these bus companies reduces the possibility of political resistance from local operators and bus companies, which helped in implementing the TransMilenio quickly and smoothly&lt;ref name =&quot;Arturo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Restraining use of private cars===

Several policies were proposed to restrain the use of private cars, such as the ''Pico y Placa'' (Peak and Plate) Policy, Car-free Day and the Public Space Policy. These policies focused on reducing car use while improving mass transit mode share &lt;ref name =&quot;Arturo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

The ''Pico y Placa'' Policy sets restraints on who can drive during peak hours by restricting car use based on license plate numbers, greatly reducing peak hour traffic volume. About 40% of cars are not allowed to enter the municipal area during the morning peak hours (from 7a.m. to 9 a.m.) and the evening peak hours (from 5:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.). The ''Pico y Placa'' Policy is very effective at reducing peak hour vehicle volumes, which led to a 60% decrease in average commute times&lt;ref name =&quot;Arturo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;. While effective, many wealthier residents evade the law by purchasing multiple cars. 

Car-Free Day was designed for residents to experience the services that other transportation modes could provide. The experience was implemented from 6:30 a.m. to 7:30p.m on February 24, 2000, a typical Thursday work day. During this period, no private cars or trucks under 3 tons were allowed to circulate on the urban road network with the exception of 14% of residents who were invited to travel by car. During that day, former car lanes were provided exclusively for pedestrians and bicycle use. The Car-Free Day experience reflects that the transportation system can operate smoothly without private cars &lt;ref name =&quot;Arturo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Increasing pedestrian infrastructure === 
Public space policies worked to convert parking spaces into sidewalks for pedestrian needs. There was strong opposition from business owners who complained that a lack of parking would hurt their businesses, and many retailers decided to leave areas in which these policies had been implemented. Lack of communication and explanation about the objectives and benefits of such a policy may be a major reason for the difficulties that the policy faced, which in an important lesson for the development of public space policy in the future.

== Discussion Questions ==

1. Is it realistic for a system like TransMilenio to be expected to exist without a public subsidy for operations? Is overcrowding and passenger discomfort the price paid for the lack of subsidy, and if so, is it worth the price?

2. Is it ethical for government officials and policymakers to negotiate with demonstrably corrupt and criminal entities, such as Bogota’s entrenched transportation interests, to achieve policy goals? In what situations would it be acceptable?

3. Should major cities aspire towards the installation of rail infrastructure or is bus rapid transit on a grand scale a viable alternative? Are major cities without rail systems less competitive and/or prestigious? How should Bogotáimprove its overcrowded transit system? 

4. TransMilenio riders pay a single price regardless of the distance that they are traveling. This greatly assists low-income residents who live far from the city center and would face additional hardship if forced to pay for their extra travel distance. In the United States, however, many cities charge suburban residents (who are traditionally more affluent) a premium rate for their extra travel distance into the city. Is this fair, is this wise, and will the practice need to be re-evaluated as more poverty moves out of central cities and into the suburbs?

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
This book takes a practical, non-mathematical look at relational database normalization using the normal forms defined by Codd and others.
=Introduction=
Edgar Codd invented the concept of the relational database. Starting in 1970, he defined three &quot;normal forms&quot;, to which three more forms were added, which govern the organization of columns into tables. These definitions use precise but abstract mathematical terms, which makes them difficult to understand, much less apply. However, practical application of the principles behind these forms leads to solid table designs that avoid pitfalls. Once the design is fully &quot;normalized&quot;, the design may then be &quot;de-normalized&quot; for performance reasons, if necessary.
=Example Tables=
The following tables are used in examples. The first group illustrates basic relationships. Material_Vendor is an example of a &quot;relationship table&quot;; these are used to describe the relationship between the rows of two or more other tables. The second group is used to illustrate the possibility of creating matrices of attributes, which should be avoided. 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Table !! Primary Key !! Foreign Keys !! Other
|-
| Material || material_number ||  || 
|-
| Vendor || vendor_number ||  || vendor_name&lt;br /&gt;vendor_contact_name

|-
| Order || order_number || vendor_number || 
|-
| Order_Detail || order_number&lt;br /&gt; line_number || material_number || required_date
|}
Notes about Order_Detail. Business requirements mandate the following:
* The use of a &quot;line number&quot; to identify order lines
* On an order, the combination of material and required date must be unique

|-
! Table !! Primary Key 
|-
| Shoe_Style || style 
|-
| Shoe_Size || size 
|-

|-

|}

=Keys=
A &quot;key&quot; consists of a set of one or more columns that uniquely identify a row. For example, &lt;tt&gt;order_number&lt;/tt&gt; is a key for the Order table, while &lt;tt&gt;order_number, line_number&lt;/tt&gt; is a key for the Order_Detail table. Note that a table could have no keys, but then its rows could then only be accessed sequentially.

A &quot;candidate key&quot; is a key in which all the columns are needed to uniquely identify the row. So, the key &lt;tt&gt;order_number, line_number, material_number, release_date&lt;/tt&gt; uniquely identify an Order_Detail row, but it is not a candidate key because neither &lt;tt&gt;material_number&lt;/tt&gt; nor &lt;tt&gt;release_date&lt;/tt&gt; are needed when line_number is present.

Some tables have more than one candidate key. The Order_Detail table has two:
* &lt;tt&gt;order_number, line_number&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;order_number, material_number, release_date&lt;/tt&gt;

The &quot;primary key&quot; is the candidate key chosen to identify rows in the table. 

Note that all the examples of keys up to this point use columns that are actual attributes of the tables that contain them. A &quot;surrogate key&quot; is a single column with unique, non-null values added to the table for the sole purpose of acting as the primary key. Note that the use of surrogate keys is frowned upon by purists, and the following discussion of normalization assumes that they are not used. Having said that, the use of surrogate keys is a common practice and is discussed later.

The &quot;natural key&quot; is a candidate key, not the surrogate key, that otherwise would have been chosen as the primary key.

=Normal Forms=
Codd defined the first three normal forms, while the second three were added later. Note that each form requires that the requirements of the previous form be met as a prerequisite. Therefore, second normal form requires the first, etc. 

The rules of each normal form must hold for every candidate key. This becomes an issue when surrogate keys are used, as they tend to mask the columns of the natural key. For example, if a surrogate key is added to Order_Detail, then &lt;tt&gt;order_number&lt;/tt&gt; is redundant and should be removed. However, it cannot be ignored.
==First, Second, Third Normal Forms==

These forms can be summed up by, &quot;Each non-key column must state a single fact that depends on the key, the whole key, and nothing but the key.&quot;
===First Normal Form===
Each column must have one meaning and contain one piece of information. Note that the definition of &quot;one piece of information&quot;, or &quot;atomicity&quot;, is vague. Here are examples of column values that violate this principle.
* contact =
** '1-415-555-1212'
** 'Jane Bloggs'
* phone_numbers = '1-415-555-1212, 1-415-555-1213'
* address = '123 Main St., Anytown, CA, 94501'
In the first example, the column contains contains a phone number in one row and a name in another. This violates &quot;same meaning.&quot;

In the second example, one column contains two phone numbers. This violates &quot;one piece of information.&quot;

In the third example, the column holds one address, but the address is (typically) composed of several pieces of information: street, city, state, postal code. This also violates &quot;one piece of information.&quot;

Again, the application of this rule is somewhat subjective. For example, U.S. phone numbers could be decomposed into country code (1), area code, and the prefix and suffix. Whether that is appropriate depends on how phone numbers are validated and queried by applications.

Practically, having one piece of information per column greatly simplifies maintenance, query, and data integrity.

===Second Normal Form===
Every non-key column must describe the full key and not a subset. 

For example, adding vendor_number to the Order_Detail table violates this rule, since it describes order_number.

Practically, following this rule avoids repeating information found in parent tables. This simplifies maintenance and maintains data integrity.

===Third Normal Form===
Every non-key column must ''directly'' describe the primary key. Effectively, this forbids B describes A describes the primary key.

For example, adding vendor_name to the Order table violates this rule. While vendor_name indirectly describes order_number, it directly describes vendor_number that describes order_number.

Practically, this rule simplifies maintenance and protects data integrity. If a buyer wants to change a vendor name, updating a row in Vendor is simple. Finding all the tables that contain the vendor's name, given that there is no guarantee that the column names are all vendor_name, and then updating all their rows can become very complicated.

===Additional Rules===
Since Codd laid down his rules, the definitions of the first three normal forms have been refined.
====Two columns may not share the same meaning====
This forbids repeating groups or arrays of columns.

For example, updating the Vendor table to have columns vendor_contact_name_1, vendor_contact_name_2 violates this rule.

Practically, this avoids data integrity problems where two columns contain the same value and simplifies queries. It also avoids a situation where another column or two must be added to hold all applicable values for a row.

====No optional columns====
This forbids creating one or more columns that are populated only if another column contains specific values. The goal is to avoid situations where the columns have meaning only for a subset of rows.

For example, adding columns to the Order table to hold electronic data transmission information only for participating vendors violates this rule. The EDT columns have no meaning for non-EDT vendors.

Practically, this doesn't have huge consequences in itself. It avoids the temptation to assign multiple meanings to the same column, which violates first normal form and can lead to data integrity issues and confusion among developers.

====No dependencies between rows====
This rule forbids a value in a column in one row from depending on a value in another row.

For example, in the Material_Vendor table, adding a column primary_vendor violates this rule. The reason is that, for any material_number, the column may be true for only one vendor_number. Setting the value to true for another vendor_number causes data corruption, or at a minimum, an unique constraint exception.

Practically, this rule avoids complex updates and potential data corruption. In the example, the information could be stored by adding a primary_vendor_number column to the Material table.

==Boyce/Codd, Fourth, Fifth Normal Forms==
These normal forms deal with specialized situations.

===Boyce/Codd Normal Form===
For each candidate key, it should not be possible to determine any of its columns using another set of columns.

For example, adding vendor_material_number to the Order_Detail table violates this rule. 
 * order_number, vendor_material_number, required_date is a candidate key
 * vendor_number, material_number can be used to determine the vendor_material_number using the Material_Vendor table  (vendor_number is obtained from the Order table)

Practically, this sort of thing can occur when a column's value is derived from a non-key column of a &quot;relationship table&quot;, e.g. vendor_material_number in Material_Vendor. Generally, data integrity and design simplicity are better preserved by looking up such values with a query.

===Fourth Normal Form===
Do not create a matrix of unrelated facts.

For example, assume each shoe style comes in a subset of sizes, a subset of colors, and a subset of widths, but all combinations of these subsets are available. A table with columns style, size, color, width violates this rule.

Practically, matrices of unrelated values create large numbers of rows that are difficult to maintain. For example, 20 sizes by 3 colors by 3 widths requires 180 rows, and the addition of one color requires 60 additional rows. Three tables require 26 rows total, and adding a color requires one row.

===Fifth Normal Form===
Do not create a matrix of independent keys related to one fact.

For example, assume each shoe style comes in a subset of sizes, a subset of colors, and a subset of widths, but all combinations of these subsets are available. In addition, multiple vendors supply each style, but some vendors supply only certain sizes, colors, and widths, independent of style. A table with style, vendor_number, size violates this rule, since size is a fact about both style and vendor_number. 

Practically, matrices of independent keys related to a fact also create large numbers of rows that are difficult to maintain.

=Etcetera=
This section discusses a few points of database table design.

==Common Normalization Violations==
Most normalization violations result from misapplying the &quot;Keep It Simple&quot; principle. Avoiding another table or another join in a query seem to reduce complexity. In practice, the hacks needed to maintain data integrity or to query unnormalized tables end up adding far more complexity, typically after the design is in use and correcting it is no longer possible.

The most frequent fix for an improperly normalized table is to remove the problem columns, and then to add them to a new table if they don't already exist elsewhere.

Many designers insist that 3rd normal form is sufficient, and the other normal forms are unnecessary. That's true, except when it isn't. Most of the time, the higher normal forms don't come into play because they deal with unusual situations. When those unusual situations come up, handling them appropriately can avoid problems. If a table's columns look unusual, look for problems even if they meet 3rd normal form criteria.

Here are a few thought patterns that lead to bad designs.

* This table can have at most five values for this column; I don't need child table.
* These values never change, I can save joins in my queries by adding columns to the main table.
* I have three sets of rules that all apply to the same value; I'll put all their inputs into one table and set the unused columns to null.
* These rows are grouped by a partial key; I'll set a flag to indicate which row is preferred in each group.
* This key has multiple sets of lookup values; it will be simpler to put them all in one table.

;purpose
: Provide multiple '''links''' in a CSV line or lines of such.
* If two or more links are passed the message begins with &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;''Main pages:&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* The parameter ''''bare'''' when and if defined suppresses the prefixed &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;''Main pages:&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:* AND the auto-indentation of the line (':') as well as the italicization of the body of the CSL. 
:* prefixing instead a single space character, so a editor can prefix as she likes and use the list in line in a continued text phrase.
:* ''''''bare mode'''' instead'' provides both a ''''prefix'''' and ''''suffix'''' parameter ahead and behind the text/link CSV stream, so an additional format mode can then be incorporated such as &amp;lt;small&amp;gt; tags, bolding or italics, or even html (inside the default span wrapper).
* The span wrapper can be given a style in addition to the built in Font-face (FF), Font-size (FS) and Line-height (LH) parameters using |style=. The actual span declaration follows:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;noprint&quot; style=&quot;{{{style|}}}; font-face:{{{FF|Garamond}}}; line-height:{{{LH|85%}}};  font-size:{{{FS|90%}}};&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.

I have replied to your question about Horcruxes on [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Horcruxes#Analysis|the page where you asked it]]; to keep it a textbook, I have placed the answer in the Analysis section. The key point is this: re-embodiment does not &quot;use up&quot; a Horcrux. A Horcrux is more like an anchor than a spare soul.

==Introduction==
Text files names with '''*.texture.txt''' suffix and extension are used in virtually every asset to configure graphics textures behavior in Trainz. These files may also control how textures are processed by {{TA|Content Manager}}, notably by providing {{TN|pathspec}}s, and triggering additional validations to best generate healthy assets.

These files are, through ignorance or the workings of the exporters, generally located in the same folder as the source texture files, typically .bmp, .tga or .jpg, and make reference to them, but can utilize some basic DOS/Windows file structure navigation one folder level removed, but not two&lt;ref&gt;Reported as a bug 2014-0828 by Fabartus after experimentation&lt;/ref&gt;. 
 
These are control files which are generated automatically by the Trainz exporter or importer (i.e. Translator software from {{wp|Gmax}}, {{wp|Blender}} and AutoDesk's {{wp|3dsMax}} formats to Trainz data needs&amp;mdash;Auran/N3V sources and updates these from time to time) but may be edited by hand when specialization is required.

The first three or four lines are the most common and in fact, most texture.txt files have only two to four lines, unlike the below:
{{LeftBox|1=
'''Composite Example:'''
: Primary=WayCoolTexture.tga
: Alpha=WayCoolTexture.tga
: Tile=st
: AlphaHint=masked
: Anisotropy=16
: MagFilter=linear
: MinFilter=linear
: MipFilter=linear
:''(Example only, not recommended settings)''
}}

Each token is specified on a new line. There is no white space on either side of the '=' sign. A empty value is sometimes valid. 
The syntax is:
 &lt;token&gt;=&lt;value&gt;

Texture.txt files may be commented using the C++ 'hack-hack' comment style:

 // This file was created for TRS2006-SP1 then retrograded to trainz-build 2.0 for TRS2004

==Tokens==
Here is a list of supported tokens. '''Any other values should not be used.'''
*Further, It must be understood that 
# the mesh and the texture.txt file are ''always in the same folder.''
# The texture itself can be in a common location, and referenced by several meshes of the asset (how many black.tga textures do the 8 or more meshes of a Steam Locomotive need?), but the referencing is via the texture.txt file whose name '''must match''' with the name the mesh is referencing. i.e. The mesh refers to the ''name of the texture.txt file'', which need &lt;u&gt;not&lt;/u&gt; match that of the texture used as the Primary within.
# Assuming a common texture file, different mesh names and/or locations, and a different 'look' from additional graphics: 
## four of the eight in the above example ''each with a different name' can reference the same texture and use identical processing 'tokens', but ''each '''must exist''''' to support ''it's referencing from within the {{TG|M|mesh file}}''.
## two of the remaining could be referencing an entirely different 'black2.tga' 
## and the others the same but with a different mix of the tokens presented above in the composite example, and detailed below. 
# The points to master are the {{TG|Onto}} relationship of a texture.txt file and mesh file, and that the texture name and location can be very different&amp;mdash;there is no reason they need be co-located with either the mesh or the texture.txt file. The later has the job of marrying the two and defining the way ''THAT MESH'' renders the texture image.
&amp;nbsp;
* In the below, we'll present a 'example line' in the same sections. And amplifying commentary in () following.

===Primary===
Specify texture file name
* '''&lt;texture name&gt;''' - Primary texture.  Filename including extension.
&lt;pre&gt;Primary=common_textures\Red-roof-tiles.tga&lt;/pre&gt; 
* (The MESH location is in folder containing a subfolder named 'common_textures', so likely the Asset's root folder '{{TBS|username|p=..\editing\username}}'.)
&lt;pre&gt;Primary=..\green-siding.tga&lt;/pre&gt;
* (The MESH location is in a sub-folder and 'common_textures' are in the level above, likely the asset's {{TN|root folder}})
&lt;pre&gt;Primary=..\traincar_left_door\brass-window-trim.tga&lt;/pre&gt; 
* (The MESH location is likely in a '..\traincar_right_door\' 'sister folder' from it's relative containing the 'shared_texture'. Likely, both are sub-folders of a '\traincar_asset-name_body' folder. This example from tests using a Randall Whitepass Pullman coach, and the brass.tga texture.)
&amp;nbsp;
===Alpha===
Specify alpha channel for texture.  Note that if there is only one 32bit file with RGB and A channels, this must still be specified with the same name used in Primary
* '''&lt;texture name&gt;''' - Alpha texture, may be the same or different from the primary


===Tile===
Wrap texture addressing horizontally, vertically or both.  Otherwise texture is clamped.
* &lt;empty&gt; - '''(default)''' No wrapping
* '''s''' - Wrap horizontally
* '''t''' - Wrap vertically
* '''st''' - Wrap both horizontally and vertically


===Dimension===
Number of dimensions the texture has.  Not required since only 2D textures are currently supported.
* '''two''' - '''(default)''' Two dimensional
* '''cube''' - (unsupported)
* '''volume''' - (unsupported)
* '''one''' - (unsupported)


===Compression===
Compression format used by CMP.  '''If this is not supplied, format is chosen automatically'''.
* '''none''' - Do not compress.  Warning: Uncompressed textures consume large amounts of memory and slow performance. 
* '''dxt1''' - Suitable for opaque or alpha masked textures
* '''dxt3''' - Alternately the best for alpha blended textures if the texture contains sharp contrasts.  Try DXT5 first.
* '''dxt5''' - Usually the best for alpha blended textures


===Hint===
Texture usage hint, '''for internal use only'''. Note this should NOT be used to try and disble mip mapping.
* '''static''' - '''(default)''' Standard texture resource
* '''dynamic''' - Texture will be modified in memory


===NormalMapHint===
Hint about texture being a normal map.  Important to use as this will affect final texture quality.  Compression, mip map generation and renormalization of XYZ (RGB) is effected.
* '''none''' - '''(default)''' This is not a normal map
* '''normalmap''' - This is a normal map


===ModifyMap===
Allows the texture to be modified when the texture.txt file is read.  Currently this is to allow the green channel (Y axis) to be flipped for normal maps. 
* '''none''' - '''(default)''' Do not modify texture
* '''flipgreen''' - flip green channel which is Y Axis of normal map


===AlphaHint===
Specify how the alpha channel is used.  Affects final alpha quality.  May also affect texture compression and mip generation.
* '''opaque''' - '''(default with no alpha present)''' No alpha channel used.
* '''semitransparent''' - '''(default with alpha present)''' Alpha blended
* '''masked''' - Alpha masked  - this gives 8-bit {{wp|grayscale}} shading from full transparency to fully blocking the object depending upont the pixel by pixel values of the Alpha channel or mask.
{{TRS-warning|Pre-TS09 Trainz versions will generate Faults from AlphaHint tokens, and likely most of the below tokens as well. The PEVtool {{TA|Images2tga}} released in 2010 and now available for download ({{plain link|http://trainz.shaneturner.co.uk/tutorials/index.php/home/utilities|here}}) may generate them even in assets from such older Trainz assets. The fix is to comment out such lines with the '//' and the asset should work in the TRS era software.}}


===Anisotropy===
Anisotropic sampling quality.  The higher the number, the better the visual quality but at significant performance cost. Where texture quality is needed specify a higher value. Trainz can now control anisotropy via a slider, so the highest setting is used by default.  
* '''1''' - No anisotropic filtering
* '''2''' - Low
* '''4''' - Medium
* '''8''' - High
* '''16''' - '''(default)''' Very High

===AutoMip===
Auto mip map generation. Chris, is this depricated?  CMP now generates mip maps at highest quality instead of game load/run time.
* '''none''' - Don't generate mip maps
* '''default''' - '''(default)''' Whatever the default method is
* '''fastest''' - Attempt to improve load time at expense of quality
* '''nicest''' - Attempt to improve quality regardless of time


===MagFilter===
Texture sampling filter used when texture is magnified
* '''nearest''' - No blending with neighboring texels
* '''linear''' - '''(game default)''' Blends with neighboring texels for smooth zoom effect
* '''default''' - '''(default)''' Game default

  
===MinFilter===
Texture sampling filter used when texture is minified
* '''nearest''' - No blending with neighboring texels
* '''linear''' - '''(game default)''' Blends with neighboring texels for smooth shrink effect
* '''default''' - '''(default)''' Game default


===MipFilter===
Texture sampling filter used on mip map selection
* '''nearest''' - No blending with other mip maps
* '''linear''' - '''(game default)''' Smooth blendig between mip maps (Note, operates independently but should be used in conjunction with anisotropic sampling)
* '''default''' - '''(default)''' Game default
* '''none''' - Disable mip map generation in CMP and use in game.  Specifically for user interface elements.


=Comments &amp; Suggestions=
* ''Hint'' is mentioned even though it is intended for internal use only, because it has been used and abused by well meaning people since its discovery.  ''Anisotropy'' should be used to improve texture quality, and ''MipFilter=none'' should be used to disable mip mapping only for interface textures.

#It is a Western Romance tongue spoken in Piedmont, but it isn’t the first minority language all over its actual regional area. In the north-western valleys of Canavèis and in Susa Valley (Province of Turin) Franco-provençal is spoken (the same language which is spoken in Aosta Valley and in Savoy). In Chison Valley and in the Valleys of the Province of Cuneo, Piedmontese is often understood, but getting closer to French border, toponyms, surnames of people and spoken language are Occitan. [If you are getting bored, skip to point 4]. South-west of the town of Alessandria, the local language becomes quite different from the standard Piedmontese, due to the Ligurian, Lombard and Emilian influences. So the town of Novi Ligure and its surroundings are considered part of Ligurian linguistic area, whilst Tortona is considered part of the Lombard area. The so-called Lomellina, a land which is part of Lombardy, is considered by Lombards an area influenced by Piedmontese, even if it clearly remains a Lombard-speaking area, because of ancient political and administrative reasons. The language in the provinces of Novara and Verbania is considered very close to Lombard by Piedmontese people, but not everybody is sure that they are part of Lombard language, particularly because someone from this area considers himself to be piedmontese, since their province has constantly been part of Piedmont in the last centuries; then there is the Ossolan language, spoken in the extreme north, which is impossible to be included in Piemontese, and is part of Western Lombard Language.
#It evolved from Latin, surrounded by Occitans, Franco-provençals and Lombards. It mantained some words of the pre-Roman Celtic tribes and has been influenced by German presences.
#Piedmontese sometimes is similar to English, because what you say isn’t always what you write. In English the same letters can be read in different ways, like in b’’’oo’’’k and d’’’oo’’’r and the same word can be pronounced in slightly different ways according to the origin of the speaker, like in American and British English. In Piedmontese most of words are written in Turinese, which has always been the richest source of written documents in Piedmontese, and people who are from other provinces use to say just the way they know, but use to write in standard ortography.
# Piedmontese ortography has became across the years very accurate, and it is possible to correct even the smallest mistakes. It is called ‘’’Grafìa dij Brandé’’, it was born in 1783 when Royal Doctor Morissi Pipin published the first Piedmontese Grammar for the Princess Marie Clotilde of France who wanted to learn Piedmontese to speak it at court. In 1930s this writing system was restored and refined, and in the XX century most of the piedmontese editions adopted it. This is actually a lucky chance for this language, since many northern italian minority languages still lack a unified writing and lead on some different traditions and experimentations.
# Piedmontese is a quite omogeneous linguistic area, with no changes in grammar structure and just some plurality of pronounciations, forms and formules.
# Stats in 2005 said that piedmontese was spoken by two million people and was understood by around 1.3 million, who are decreasing due to the pervasiveness of Italian. Since 2005 the numbers continued to reduce, so that statistics is no longer valid. Many people were elder and mostly illiterate as of piedmontese. Good-level literacy is extimated at about 2000 people. The aim of this modest work is also to help people who already heard the language and would like to learn how to write and read it.
# Is isn’t an Italian nor a French dialect. It is a language, as recognized by UNESCO. Anyway we don’t need to repeat it again: who considers it a caricaturist and shoddy speech won’t change his mind, even if he could because there is plenty of sources.
# There is a consistent literature in Piedmontese which deals with many genres using many literary forms.
# It reached its peak in the XVIII century, when it was an official language and the court language of the Kingdom of Sardinia.
# It hasn’t to be used only in certain circles. It is a real language. It can be used nonchalantly to talk about vineyard as well as about international politics.
# Obviously Piedmontese never entered university, but it developed a flush technical vocabulary, for instance mechanical vocabulary, because it was used in work places till the 1980s, even if in the great factories it was prohibited in order to permit the integration of the manpower from outside Piedmont together with the local workers.
# To learn Piedmontese nowadays can be remarkable because it is rapidly dying out and you may be the last who know it.
# While learning it, you may notice that it is very different from Italian and it has a lot of links with many European languages.
# Its grammar is not too difficult: it has eleven irregular verbs, most of substantives don’t have a plural form and has only 6 indicative verbal tenses. The conjunctive is something less important, anyaway it will be reported.
# Lastly, it may be interesting to see how many links there are among Piedmontese and other languages, such as French, Italian, English and Hispanic languages. You may notice that those people who improved their Piedmontese, then were much more able to practice new languages. Anyhow, it is useless. It is not true that without knowing piedmontese language you won’t obtain what you aspire. There is plenty of people who was unaware of his mother tongue, but he did great things in his lifetime. Piedmontese is just a style, it is a way to do things, it a feel, a ‘’’deuit’’’, fine and lusty, direct and hearty. That is probably why a speech in Piedmontese should match with some silence. If you wish, it will be a feature that you will have and that will make you different from others.

I see that you recently created these two pages.  I believe that they are supposed to be part of the Stamp Collection book but the way you have created them has meant that they are two separate books and readers will be unable to find them because the names are written in Cyrillic.  Can you tell me where in the Stamp Catalogue book they should be so I can move them?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_the_Isle_of_Mann.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 15:02, 31 August 2014 (UTC)

Above is the appearance in main namespace with no text added.
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;!-- Please add categories to the bottom of this page, and add interwikis to Wikidata. --&gt;
Above is the '''Default appearance''' with Lorem simulating a message in Main or article namespace, note the 'simulated text passed' message continues on the same line as the header line. So prefix with HTML break or hardbreaks as best suits your needs.
----
;Usage
Place as top item in a [[Trainz]] Wikibook-How-to-edit tutorial, Template or Trainz Wikibook Project organization or tutorial page.
&amp;nbsp;
* See the auto-category pages listed: [[:Category:Trainz Admin]] for examples and {{TL|Trainz templates}} for other Trainz project templates easing editing chores.
;Default message in Category namespaces
{{Trainz-admin|ns=Category|no=1}}
&lt;br&gt;

;Appearance with default message in Template Namespaces
{{Trainz-admin|ns=Template|no=1}}
&amp;nbsp;

'''Control and optional Parameters:'''&lt;br
/&gt;
# The 'inhibit' parameter suppresses message box generation but auto-categorizes the page. If expressed, that is ALL the template will do.&lt;br
/&gt;
# The Admin=''something'' asserts the autocategorization into  [[:Category:Trainz Admin]].&lt;s&gt;The 'noAdmin' or 'no' parameter instead suppresses the normal and usual auto-category declaration incorporating the page into [[:Category:Trainz Admin]]. Then the template does no Auto-categorization and at least one must be defined on the page.&lt;s&gt;
# The ''''pipe'''' named parameter can be used as ''a 'auto-pipetrick override' to alter the category sort order'' from the default &lt;nowiki&gt;{{SUBPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br
/&gt;
# The 'ns' parameter will replace the ''auto-namespace sensing'', so change the output to the default message depending on which namespace contains the tag.&lt;br
/&gt;
# The 'altmsg' named parameter takes a text string and presents that alternative message, replacing the two default messages which assert by namespace.&lt;br
/&gt;
## Only Categories and Template namespaces currently sense spaces and have boilerplate messages. If adding the template to a page in those namespaces, place the template, and evaluate whether to override it or not. You can then cut and paste the boilerplate and customize it as seems appropriate in the altmsg definition.&lt;br
/&gt;
## Defining ns=&amp;nbsp; causes the namespace message generation to be skipped, showing only the output 'co-msg' or 'message' parameters. After the text box 'main explaination' passed in by defining ''''text'''' or ''''|1=''''.&lt;br
/&gt;
## The bulleted part (namespace sensed) is programmable with the 'alt-msg' override parameter. ''(The linefeed and prefixed bullet are provided free of charge.)''&lt;br
/&gt;
# The default message is ANDED with either 'co-msg' or 'message' - both of which may be blank (undefined), so presents only a box template as shown here. ''(Template namespace message shown)''
## If defined, the ''''co-msg''' will insert a break and hard break (line across) before displaying the co-msg. 'Co-msg' asserts over 'message'''', which appends the ''''1 or text'''' parameters first displaying their text under the standard title line. (First line above in the box)&lt;br
/&gt;
## The 'message' parameter will asuffix onto the namespace boilerplate text, or if 'ns' suppresses the canned messages, will present as the sole message without a leading bullet. To suppress the two boilerplate messages (category space or Template namespaces, define ''''|ns=&amp;nbsp;'''' which skips to the default (do nothing prefix text)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Many tutorials for C++ are targeted to C++ as it was standardized in 2003 (C++03) or earlier. Recent progress has produced C++11 and now C++14, and these newer versions have improved the level of simplicity and readability that is feasible for beginners. Many of these improvements supplant older features as the &quot;best way&quot; to solve problems. This book will present problems of increasing complexity, and not explain any given feature until it becomes appropriate for a problem. (See [[Talk:Modern C++: The Good Parts|the talk page]] for a detailed discussion of this.)

This book assumes the reader has access to an instructor (or savvy friend), and takes advantage of this for some of the assignments.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Vision ==
I want to have a constructive conversation so that this &quot;book&quot; might be as good as possible. All details are open to question; I don't want to suffer from myopia on this.

Certain features will be deliberately avoided or warned against, such as:
* &lt;code&gt;using namespace&lt;/code&gt;
* raw pointers, C-style arrays
* multiple inheritance
* &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt;
* macros
* implicit brackets
* labels, &lt;code&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt;
Because understanding such features is important for reading code and occasionally for writing it (usually when calling an archaic library), they will be detailed in [[{{SUBJECTPAGENAME}}/Appendix A: The Bad Parts|Appendix A: The Bad Parts]]. The intention is not to forbid these features absolutely, but to delay the reader from learning them until he has the background to understand which problems they should be applied to.

A tentative preliminary outline of pages:
* The Basics
** &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;std::cout&lt;/code&gt;
** variables, &lt;code&gt;std::cin&lt;/code&gt;
** operators
* Control Flow
** &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;for(;;)&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;for(:)&lt;/code&gt;
** functions
** function overloading
** exceptions
* Organizing Data
** &lt;code&gt;std::vector&lt;/code&gt;, consumption of templates
** &lt;code&gt;for(:)&lt;/code&gt;
** classes as PODs, no &lt;code&gt;struct&lt;/code&gt; keyword
** member functions
** access modifiers
** reference parameters
** constructors
** &lt;code&gt;std::unique_ptr&lt;/code&gt;
** &lt;code&gt;std::shared_ptr&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;std::weak_ptr&lt;/code&gt;
** simple template construction
** &lt;code&gt;std::array&lt;/code&gt;, non-type template parameters
** inheritance
** &lt;code&gt;virtual&lt;/code&gt; functions

== Topics to cover ==

In addition to the above list, I've needed to avoid these topics so far:
* &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; cases in switch statements;
* &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt; in loops;
* useful fall-through of switch statement cases; and
* default arguments.

:A void function works like other functions, except that no value is returned. Calls to void functions are not allowed to be used in other expressions. A void function can have &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statements, but cannot use values in them. For example, this void function uses a return statement to avoid executing some logic (the call to &lt;code&gt;baz()&lt;/code&gt;):
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
void example()
{
	if(foo())
	{
		bar();
		return;
	}
	baz();
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;</text>

 • It lists a template which is useful organizing the divisions of the Trainz Wikibook. The template allows a page to be moved to the [[Trainz/references]] division when it is also desired to retain a simple link to the page in the ''''Trainz\''somepagename'' pages'''' which may be easily searched.}}
;Usage
This template auto-categorizes Trainz Wikibooks redirect terms into the [[:Category: redirects to Trainz reference pages]] under the [[:Category:Trainz redirect pages|auto-Category:Trainz redirect pages]]. 
* It's proper placement is on '''the same line''' as the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect [[Trainz/whatever page name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/code&gt; as in the below example:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect [[Trainz/whatever page name]]{{R to TRS-ref}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
* It will display the message below in Preview when placed, but may not if the template is put on the second or subsequent lines, for the #redirect line stops additional page parsing.
&lt;div&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

==Output Message==
;When placed correctly on the first line of a redirect page, the page with the edit finished will display
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
This page is a redirect from a Wikibooks [[Trainz]] page which either has been moved to the [[Trainz/references]] division of the Trainz Wikibook or ''has by design'' been placed in the Trainz/references hierarchy and the term is important and common enough to make a searchable link in the Trainz or {{CHAPTERNAME}} division of the work. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">C++ is a '''compiled language''', meaning that those who use it commonly use a '''compiler''' to convert C++ source code into something more machine-friendly, which is then executed. You will need a compiler to complete the exercises in this book, but fear not! Compilers are freely available and reasonably easy to set up. This page will attempt to help you decide which one(s) to install.

If you expect to learn GUI development with Qt later, you should install [http://qt-project.org/downloads#qt-creator Qt Creator], and make sure to check the box for the latest MinGW. ('''Note:''' If you're one of [[User:Jesdisciple|&lt;u&gt;my&lt;/u&gt;]] students, get Qt Creator.)

[http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-express-windows-desktop Visual Studio Express for Windows Desktop] is a good free option which requires essentially zero setup, other than a very long installation. If you have money to spend, [http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs some other version of Visual Studio] can serve you better, but you can make that decision later.

[http://llvm.org/releases/download.html Clang] can be a better option, except that its setup can be very involved, especially if you happen to want the latest version for Windows (in which case read [http://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html#buildWindows this]). Clang is well-known for very useful error messages.

[https://gcc.gnu.org/install/binaries.html The GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)] is another good option. On Windows, MinGW is little more than the compiler while Cygwin is like some Linux for your Windows. If you don't understand that last part, just go with MinGW.

If you don't trust my short list, see [http://www.stroustrup.com/compilers.html the significantly longer one] from the originator of C++, Bjarne Stroustrup.

Once you have a compiler installed, see [[../Hello, world!|the next page]] to make sure it's in working order.

==Code build number==
: ''The main enhanced Wikibook data tables corresponding to the N3V source page {{n3V|Trainz_build_versions}} page is found at {{TL|Version And Build Numbers}}, which includes release dates, and citations.''

The '''Code build number''' or '''Trainz build version''' (two names meaning the identical 'tracking number') is a type of {{wp|model number}} of the software, an  unique software specific identifier that in Trainz practices&amp;mdash; increments not only with 'named' main retail releases, but with each release for specific language groups, and by {{wp|Hotfix}}es, as well as by {{wp|Service_pack}} releases. As described in the Notes section below, it also changes in-house with software under development{{efn|In a December 2013 email, Trainz Version Manager James Moody stated that at times he did as many as five or six builds and related Trainz {{TGInstalls}} a day. }}

Initial Trainz code build versions are not released in initial retail release versions for all world wide languages at the same time, but these are produced as available translations, so typically, non-English releases lag by some months, but may have hot fixes or service packs already installed. As the translation needs are satisfied and an overall ''release stabilizes'', subsequent service pack releases apply to those code build numbers and effectively combine language releases into a merged common product. At the end of the process, the final service pack produces a ''single stable '''code build version''''', creating the final corresponding Trainz (two digit) version number and corresponding identical {{TBS|Trainz-build tag|&quot;Trainz-build&quot; tag}} level found in assets {{TA|config.txt file}}.

=Currently Supported Releases=
Trainz versions are known best by their ''''''Retail Release name'''''', after which N3V Games/Auran, following general software industry practices subsequently release bug fixing '''hot fixes''' and usually a succession of service packs. The below table is for the most recent Windows release.
: For detailed code build version increments in:
:* {{TL|TS09}} see {{TL|Versions/TS09-Ver Table}};
:* for {{TL|TS10}} see {{TL|Versions/TS10-Ver Table}};
:* and for {{TL|TS12}} see {{TL|Versions/TS12-Ver Table}}.

==Notes and references==
{{TrainzTip|BG=white
|The term ''''build'''' or ''''build code'''' or ''''code build'''' is a computing industries {{wp|term of art}}, and is in fact a software serial number identifying a unique combination of software component files, 'built' or ''''made'''' into a particular software package of resultant files. It derives directly from ''''making'''' a ''''build'''' with a script asset generally known as a ''''''{{wp|Make_(software)|make file}}'''''' which lists out component parts, instructions on how they are to be processed into intermediate binary files (with specific names) and in what order, and additional instructions on linking the binary object files into specific modules. Make files also have the capability of tracking {{TG|dependencies}} and if a component file changes, re-building the dependent software module. IDE's or Integrated Development Environments may layer another interface above the Make level, but in effect, those merely auto-edit the make scripts, then execute the build or make. The IDE thus provides data management automation relieving some of the responsibility of updating the make or build specification from the developers.
* The make or build can be partial or all up, so that the ''''full'''' make process generates a suite of finished Library assets, executables, and dynamic link libraries whose integration can then be tested and evaluated for further development, or adjudged as''  'finalized' ''and stable, at all times then ready for a supporting role in testing related dependent code which may not be so ready. The partial make can rebuild only a part of the software, which has had further development and changes. The auto-dependency sensing of source file changes, protects the developers from forgetting a change by another member of the team; ensuring all the coder are on the same page evaluating the same build and symptoms.
* A'' 'final build' ''might also specify copying such retail release boilerplate support files (e.g. keyboard hotkeys mapping files, initial user specific files) ''into a single installation&amp;mdash;'''the build''''', which is released to publication.
* On the release of a version for Q&amp;A testing or publication for retail release, the build might then be compressed and distributed, so the end user ''Installs them'', which mostly involves a bit of bookkeeping in the computer's registry and uncompressing the ready to use files from the DVD or internet source. In the later case, the local installer's generally consist of a FTP download manager combined with the file extraction (uncompressing) software. 
* Obviously, in modularize software such as Trainz, software update builds would only need to replace run-time software and libraries which have been updated since the last stable'' 'base' version''. Some require processing local data and perhaps incorporate a patching or translation stage for certain assets, such as defaulting a problematic {{TR|K|engine}} parameter if and when a ..\local (from 3rd party or the {{TL|DLS}} sources) asset or {{TG|JA file|JA asset}} hadn't defined the data. Such a stage often incurs an extremely long processing cycle of many hours such as several that occurred in several Service Packs during TS2009 and TS2010's evolution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">What are we waiting for? Here's your first C++ program. Save it in your editor (such as Qt Creator or Visual Studio), compile or build it, and run the executable. This will prove whether your compiler is working, which will be rather important for later exercises.

==Code==
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main()
{
	std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Explanation==
Those first two lines tell the compiler what '''includes''' (pre-existing code) we need. &lt;code&gt;int main&lt;/code&gt; is required for any C++ program, and the logic inside the curly brackets is everything that will be done. The particular way that C++ requires us to arrange code is called its '''syntax'''.

In this case, we send the text &quot;Hello, world!&quot; to the console.

These first two chapters have been kept short to allow for complications with setting up your compiler, but following chapters will pick up the pace.

==Vocabulary==
; includes: files containing code that we can use in our own program.
; syntax: the specific rules of a language, or basically what the language looks like.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Now, let's allow the world to return the greeting.

==Code==
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main()
{
	std::string input;
	
	std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;;
	
	// Notice the arrows point to the right.
	std::cin &gt;&gt; input;
	std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;The world says: &quot; &lt;&lt; input &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Explanation==
We have a few new things here.

&lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; means that &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt; is a string '''variable'''. A variable is a named place in memory to store information. Since it's named, you can refer to it again and again, to put something there or to see what's already there. And as a string variable it can store text - and only text. Other kinds of variables exist, and we'll cover some of those in the next chapter.

&lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt; is a '''line comment''', which means everything after it on the same line will be ignored by the compiler.

&lt;code&gt;std::cin&lt;/code&gt; has an arrow that points in the opposite direction from the arrows of &lt;code&gt;std::cout&lt;/code&gt;, because information is flowing in the opposite direction.

After &lt;code&gt;&quot;The world says: &quot;&lt;/code&gt;, there's another arrow, and then another. This just appends more text to the output.

==Exercises==
* Extend the conversation between your program and the &quot;world&quot;. Don't bother with whether the program is responding correctly to what is typed.

==Vocabulary==
; variable: a named place in memory to store information.
; line comment: causes the compiler to ignore the rest of a line. Syntax: &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;

So first we have a &lt;code&gt;std::string&lt;/code&gt; variable named &quot;input&quot; and two &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; variables named &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;. An &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; is an integer or whole number, so it can't have a decimal point.

'''Important:''' The = (equals sign) ''does not mean equality''. In C++ it's the '''assignment operator'''; it puts the value on the right into the variable on the left, overwriting any previous value of that variable.

&lt;code&gt;std::stoi&lt;/code&gt; is a '''function''', and the name stands for '''s'''tring '''to''' '''i'''nt. It takes a string (in this case, the value of &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;) and converts it to an integer. If this isn't possible, or you enter a very large number, the program will crash and you'll probably see something about an &quot;unhandled exception&quot;. How to prevent this issue will be addressed a few chapters later.

You can read about &lt;code&gt;std::stoi&lt;/code&gt; at [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/stoi/ cplusplus.com] or [http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/stol cppreference.com]. It has some [http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/string/#functions friends], [http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string#Numeric_conversions too].

The multiplication operator in C++ is * (asterisk). Division is / (forward slash).

Try entering 3.14 as one of the integers. Oops! &lt;code&gt;std::stoi&lt;/code&gt; finds the valid integer 3 and ignores the invalid input after it. You'll get the same result for 3sdjgh. The next few chapters should allow you to write a better integer parser.

==Exercises==
* Modify the above program so it accepts decimal points ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point floating-point numbers] or &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; values). Hint: Check the links on this page.

==Vocabulary==

      <text xml:space="preserve">After reading this introduction, what is the difference between this project and the Open Source Ecology: Global Village Construction Set? Even if there is fundamental differences, I think there is some small or maybe big overlap, which could make both projects complement each other, perhaps? I dunno, just reading your idea reminded me a lot of that other one. [[Special:Contributions/189.63.9.235|189.63.9.235]] ([[User talk:189.63.9.235|discuss]]) 19:25, 1 September 2014 (UTC)

:Philosophically we have similar goals, in fact I contributed to OSE for a while.  From an engineering standpoint, the particular list of 50 machines in the GVCS appear to have been chosen by Marcin Jakubowski (OSE's founder) without any analysis.  I call this a &quot;shotgun&quot; approach - let's build a lot of machines and hope they work together.  If there is such an analysis, I could not find it in the OSE literature.  The unanswered questions include what quality of life are you aiming to support, what size should the machines be for what number of users, in what order do you build them, and do you begin with starter versions and upgrade or enlarge.  Despite the name &quot;Ecology&quot; in the organization name, the set of 50 machines are not treated as one - an interacting system where inputs and outputs from each is linked to the others.  As a systems engineer myself, the SFP is trying to address some of these holes.  I give OSE full credit for actually building hardware, and we may use and adapt some of their designs.  Since the SFP is also open source, they can borrow our data and designs in return.  We are not in competition, it's more like researchers in the same field, but in different locations and following different methods to reach our goals.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Up to now all of our programs have been very straightforward: Start at the top and read each line once until you get to the bottom. That changes now, because that's not really a very useful way to write a program. Useful programs usually repeat some things, or decide to not do some. This chapter covers how to select a course of action on the fly.

==Code==
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main()
{
	std::string input;
	int a, b;
	int greater;
	// This one starts out with a value.
	bool canDecide = true;

	std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter two integers to compare.\n&quot;;

	// Take input.
	std::cin &gt;&gt; input;
	// Parse it as an int.
	a = std::stoi(input);
	
	// Take input.
	std::cin &gt;&gt; input;
	// Parse it as an int.
	b = std::stoi(input);
	
	// This is equality, and it might be true now and false later.
	if(a == b)
	{
		// = does not mean equality, which means we can do this.
		canDecide = false;
	}
	else if (a &lt; b)
	{
		greater = b;
	}
	else
	{
		greater = a;
	}
	
	if(canDecide)
	{
		std::cout &lt;&lt; greater &lt;&lt; &quot; is the greater number.\n&quot;;
	}
	else
	{
		std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;The numbers are equal.&quot;;
	}
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Explanation==
&lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; is short for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_data_type Boolean], which means yes or no, true or false. In this case the bool variable &quot;canDecide&quot; is initialized to the value &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;. Basically, the program assumes it &quot;canDecide&quot; which number is greater, until it sees evidence to the contrary. Overwriting bools in this way can be very useful.

&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; is the equality operator; it determines whether two values are equal, and returns true or false. Note: It does not change the value of anything.

Anything that looks like &lt;code&gt;if(...){...}&lt;/code&gt; is an '''if statement'''. &lt;code&gt;a == b&lt;/code&gt; is an '''expression''' which evaluates to a bool. An expression is some code which can be resolved to a value. The curly brackets just after &lt;code&gt;if(a == b)&lt;/code&gt; contain code which will run if a equals b.

&lt;code&gt;else if&lt;/code&gt; means &quot;Otherwise, if...&quot; and is only tested if the '''condition''' (the bool) is false for the first if statement. &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; by itself doesn't test any condition, but only runs if none of the if statements in its chain have been run.

When some logic is selected for execution in this way, &quot;control&quot; is said to &quot;flow&quot; into the logic. So &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements are considered '''control flow''' statements or '''control structures''', a set which contains some other constructs to be introduced later.

==Exercises==
* Write a calculator, asking the user for two floats and an operator and then printing the result.

==Vocabulary==
; bool: one of two possible values, &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt;. Also called a '''condition'''.
; expression: some code which can be resolved to a value.
; if statement: runs if its condition is true. Syntax: &lt;code&gt;if(condition){ }&lt;/code&gt;
; control flow: which code runs, and in what order.
; control structure: a statement which modifies control flow. Also called a '''control flow statement'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Linkbot Example Idea ==

Perhaps we could motivate the use of a function by creating a function that calculates the number of radians necessary to turn a wheel of a certain radius to drive some distance. We have the equation

distance = radius*theta

and so 

radius = distance/theta

So we can have this to drive the robot 6 inches forward:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo

def rotationAmount(distance, wheel_radius):
    return distance/wheel_radius

dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect()
linkbot = dongle.getLinkbot()
linkbot.move(rotationAmount(6, 3.5), 0, -rotationAmount(6, 3.5))
&lt;/source&gt;

Or, perhaps if we want to hard-code the wheel radius, we could do

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo

wheel_radius = 3.5

def rotationAmount(distance):
    return distance/wheel_radius

dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect()
linkbot = dongle.getLinkbot()
linkbot.move(rotationAmount(6), 0, -rotationAmount(6))
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the previous chapter, you received your first assignment: to write a simple calculator. At the time, if statements were your only way to make a decision; this chapter introduces the '''switch statement''', which works similarly to the if statement but is more suited to problems like the calculator.

==Code==
Here's a calculator built around a switch statement:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main()
{
	std::string input;
	float a, b;
	char oper;
	float result;

	std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter two numbers and an operator (+ - * /).\n&quot;;
	
	// Take input.
	std::cin &gt;&gt; input;
	// Parse it as a float.
	a = std::stof(input);

	// Take input.
	std::cin &gt;&gt; input;
	// Parse it as a float.
	b = std::stof(input);

	// Take input.
	std::cin &gt;&gt; input;
	// Get the first character.
	oper = input[0];

	switch (oper)
	{
	case '+':
		result = a + b;
		break; // DON'T
	case '-':
		result = a - b;
		break; // FORGET
	case '*':
		result = a * b;
		break; // THESE
	case '/':
		result = a / b;
		break; // !!!
	}

	std::cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; oper &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; &quot; = &quot; &lt;&lt; result &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Explanation==
&lt;code&gt;[http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/basic_string/stof std::stof]&lt;/code&gt; is similar to &lt;code&gt;std::stoi&lt;/code&gt;, except it converts to float.

&lt;code&gt;input[0]&lt;/code&gt; is the first character in the string &lt;code&gt;input&lt;/code&gt;. Anytime you see square brackets with a number (or variable) between them, the number is zero-based. This means that what people normally call the &quot;first&quot; character is at index 0, the &quot;second&quot; is at index 1, and so forth.

The switch statement has exactly the same effect as the if-else chain you wrote for your own calculator. Notice that every &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; label has a matching &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statement; be careful that this is true of any switch statement you write, because otherwise you might get some very surprising behavior. Specifically, without a break statement, control will flow right past any labels, causing the logic under them to be executed in multiple cases.

==Exercises==
* Explore what happens when you divide one int by another, and how that differs from doing the same with two floats, and an int and a float. Discuss your findings with your instructor.

==Vocabulary==
; switch statement: uses its expression to select which &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; label to jump to.

&lt;div style={{TRS-style}}&gt;{{TRS-admin|altmsg=It lists a template which is useful organizing the divisions of the Trainz Wikibook. The template allows a page to be moved to the [[Trainz/Content Creation]] division when it is also desired to retain a simple link to the page in the ''''Trainz\''somepagename'' pages'''' which may be easily searched.}}
;Usage
This template auto-categorizes Trainz Wikibooks redirect terms into the '''[[:category:Trainz Content Creation]]''' under the '''{{lc|Redirects to Trainz CC pages}}''' subcategory. 
&amp;nbsp;
* It's proper placement is on '''the same line''' as the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;#redirect [[Trainz/whatever page name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/code&gt; as in the below example:

&amp;nbsp;
==Output Message==
; It will display the message below in the redirect page when placed properly: but will not after the edit is saved if the template is incorrectly put on the second or subsequent lines, for the #redirect line stops additional page parsing on the one line.
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

=== Purpose ===

:This template is used with {{Tl|ORP-bot}} to set off Trainz reference oriented and organized Wiki pages about intermediate, or advanced topics, categorized in ''[[:category:Trainz references|Trainz reference classed topics]]'' on the Wiki.
* The Template like the other formatting templates has a multi-fold mission: 
:: 1) open the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;div style=...&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; statement on Trainz Wikibook pages. (formatting the page style)
:: 2) The ''''no'''' parameter'' can be used to suppress the assertion of the {{tl|beginner links}} table and the encapsulated 'auto-{{tl|TOCright}}'.
:: 3) The ''''noTOC'''' parameter'' can be used to suppress the assertion of the encapsulated 'auto-{{tl|TOCright}}' in the {{tl|beginner links}} table.
:: 4) The both or refs2 parameter gates the second template heading message enabled by passing the auxiliary message boilerplate control parameters:
# AM&amp;C
# FUN
# IT
# CC
# alttitle1 and alttitle2 pass override messages if desired
# placeholder parameters 1-4 or equivalently ''''p'''', ''''n'''', ''''h'''', ''''rh'''' are for page to page threading, obviating the need to return to a TOC page, and the '''p'''rev, ''''n''''ext, and local '''h''''eader page parameters allow threading of pages with an alternative to branch down. The final ''''rh'''' and ''''4'''' parameters are defaulted to {{TL|Trainz}}, the books Table of Contents.

The goal is to set and use the same control on a page by standard switches, which as seen above by duplicate headers, results in identical messages (currently) &amp;mdash;BUT DOES NOT result in the same autocategorization (groups of pages) in the paired footer templates which close the formatting in these header templates.

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;


'''What is War of coins ?'''

War of coins is a Bitcoin card game, the letter of war of coin implicates that two players are playing a card game with Bitcon &amp; Altcoins characters.

Players capture cards from the screen layout by playing a card of the same coin. The aim is to collect scoring combinations among the cards captured. When a player's captures have 7 points, the player can end the game and claim payment, or can continue the game in the hope of winning more, but risking that an opponent will win meanwhile. 

2 people play. A pack of coin cards is used, consisting of 48 cards, to which two jokers are added and total cards are 50. There are 4 cards corresponding to each of coin - the owner who has captured no exchange cards does not have to pay double to a winner with an exchangs set Bitcoin &amp; Altcoins( it is called ''Junk coin)''. Some of these cards also show a Chunk, Nonce, Hashes, Blocks, Payment Gateway or Merchant, Mining, Exchange.

The cards are divided into four unequal groups: 5 Exchange and 3 Payment Gateway or 6 Merchant and Ribbon Cards(3 Chunk and 3 Nonce and 3 Hashes,  Blocks) and 24 Mining Cards , as shown in the following illustration:

With a little practice, the cards are easy to identify with different colors and coins. In addition, our packs contain two jokers with special properties.

'''How to play'''

Please select a card shown on the screen layout to decide who play at first.

The automatic shuffle system deals 10 cards to each player and 8 face up to the screen layout as follows. The remaining cards are placed face down in a stack in the center of the screen layout to form a drawing stock.
The cards that were dealt to the screen layout are laid out face up in the center of screen layout so that all are visible. We call this the screen layout. During the game cards will be added to and captured from this layout.

Each player can automatically store a captured cards by the system, but kept face up so that those cards are visible to an opponent. We will refer to the area where a player keeps captured cards as the player's capture area. Captured cards normally remain in the player's capture area until the end of the play, but there are a few special events that require a player to surrender a captured card, moving it to another player's capture area.

The winner plays first. A normal turn consists of

1.	Clicking one card in their hand to match one of the the cards lying face-up on the screen layout, and then

2.	Automatically turning by system the top card of the stock face up and adding it to the screen layout.

This may result in the capture of some cards, as detailed below.
The aim of the game is to capture cards by clicking cards that match cards in the screen layout. Cards match when they belong to the same coins.

'''Rules'''

*	If the card you play from your hand does not match any card in the screen layout, you add it to the screen layout as a separate card, and then system turns over automatically the top card of the stock.

1.	If this card from the stock matches a card in the screen layout, you capture these two cards - the card from the stock and the matching card from the layout - and move them face up to your capture area.

2.	If the card from the stock matches two cards in the screen layout, you choose which of these cards to capture along with the stock card.

3.	If the card from the stock matches a stack of three cards in the screen layout, then it captures the stack, and system moves all four cards to your capture area.

4.	If the card turned from the stock matches nothing in the layout, it is also added to the screen layout as a separate card.

*	If the card you play from your hand matches (is the same coins as) a card in the screen layout, the system place it on top of the matching card if you click matched card. If there are two cards of those coins in the layout, you can choose on which one you will place your played card. The systems then turn up the top card of the stock. There are several possibilities:

1.	If the stock card does not match any card in the screen layout, you add it to the screen layout as a separate card, and you capture the matching pair that you created with the play from your hand, moving them to your capture area, where they are stored face up.

2.	If the stock card matches a card in the screen layout but not the card you played from your hand, then you place the stock card on a card that it matches, capture both the matching pairs you have created, and move these four cards to your capture area.

3.	If the stock card matches the pair you created with the card from your hand, and the fourth card of this coin is not in the screen layout, you are unlucky. You do not capture anything this turn, but you must add this stock card to the pair you made, creating a stack of three cards. This incident is known as a ''Double Spending''. The three-card stack remains in the screen layout and can only be captured by the fourth card of this same coin.

4.	If the card you played from your hand matched two cards in the layout, and the card you turn from the stock is also of this same coin, you capture all four cards of this coin. This is known as ''Matching public &amp; private key''.

5.	If the card you turn from the stock matches a stack of three matching cards in the layout, then you capture all four of these cards as well as the pair you made with the card you played from your hand. It is call ''Fixed Double Spending''

*	If the card you play from your hand matches a stack of three matching cards in the screen layout, then it captures this stack and all four cards are moved to your capture area. You then turn a card from the stock, which makes another capture if it matches anything on the table. After you have played from your hand and from the stock, and taken any cards that you captured, you may have the opportunity to end the game, if your score is sufficient. Otherwise the turn passes to the next player. The play continues like this until someone ends the game or until the cards run out. The deal is such that when the last player plays their last card from hand, there will be just one card remaining in the stock, and of course the final cards will automatically match, leaving the screen layout empty.

*	Any players who has three cards of the same coin may declare them and show them to the other player or can click them if there is a same coin card on the screen layout(It is call ''Complete Transaction''). This is known as ''Jiggle Wiggle''. It is a disadvantage to hold three cards of the same coin. But, if you choose to show them at the beginning of the game, you get twice points to win if you manage to win.

*	If you have four cards of the same coin, called ''Perfect Hand'', in your hand and you decided to show them at the beginning of the game, you win the game immediately, collecting 7 points from opponent or if you choose to play to get twice points if you manage to win.

*	 If there are three cards of the same coin on the screen, they are combined into a separate stack, which is captured as a single unit. Whoever has same coin card decides to play it or turn the same coin card from the stock during the game will win this separate stack and also receive an extra Mining card from opponent. It is called ''Fixed Double Spending''

*	 If you have a joker card and decided to play the joker card or when you turn over a joker card from a drawing stock, you will receive a Mining card from opponent.

*	 If there are four cards of the same coin on the screen layout, the deal is void. The cards are reshuffled and dealt again by the systems. The winner of the last game gets the 7 points.

*	 Certain special events allow the current player to capture one Mining card from opponent:

1.	There are only two cards in the screen layout, belonging to different coins, and the player captures both of them, leaving the screen layout empty. it called ''The longest chain''

2.	The screen layout includes two cards of the same coin, and the player captures both of them using the other two cards of that coin(one from your hand and one from stock). It called ''Matching Public &amp; Private Key''

3.	The player plays a card from your hand that does not match anything in the screen layout, and then draws a matching card from the stock, capturing the card just played. It called ''A chain of block''

4.	The player captures a stack of three cards by playing the fourth card of this coin from hand or stock. It called ''Fixed Double Spending''
 
5.	The player has three cards of the same coin and can be click them if there is a same coin card on the screen layout. It called ''Complete Transaction''

If any of these five things happens, each opponent surrenders one Mining card of their choice from their capture area, and the cards are moved face up to the player's capture area. A player who does not have any Mining cards in their capture area does not have to surrender a card. Mining cards of Bitcoin &amp; Litecoin are more valuable than others (being worth 2 in scoring): a player who has no ordinary Mining cards must surrender a valuable Mining card if he or she has one. However, if the play runs right to the end, the first three special events above don't count in the last player's last turn, since the cards are guaranteed to match. Nevertheless, a capturing a three-card stack at the end of the play still counts.

*	Jokers are bonus cards that add an extra element of luck to the game. Whenever you play a joker - either from your hand or by turning one up from the stock - you click it directly into your capture area face up, and immediately turn up a card from the stock which you must play as a substitute for the joker. Therefore on a turn when you play a joker, you actually turn up two cards from the top of the stock - one as a normal part of your turn and another as a result of playing the joker. If there are any jokers dealt face up on the screen layout at the start of the game, the systems automatically move them to the captured cards in front of winner of last game and replaces them in the layout by turning face up an equal number of cards from the stock.

'''Point System'''

Certain combinations of captured cards have a point score, as listed below. The first time that the total score of your captured cards at the end of your turn reaches 7 points, you have the opportunity to end the game. You must either choose &quot;end the game&quot;, in which case the play ends and you claim payment as detailed below, or you choose &quot;Keep going next Round &quot; and the game continues.
After you have choose &quot;Keep going next round&quot;, you do not get another opportunity to end the game until the score at the end of your turn is higher than it was the last time you chose &quot;Keep going next round&quot;. When this happens, you must again choose either &quot;End the game&quot; or &quot;Keep going next round&quot;.

The scores for combinations of captured cards are as follows. 

Exchange cards 

A set of 5 exchange cards scores 15 points

Any set of 4 exchange cards scores 4 points

'''Extra Rules'''

*	The player who ends the game is paid points equal to their score by other player. Note that when you end the game, it does not matter if another player has more score than you. For example in a two-player game with a target of 7, if you achieve a score of 7 at the end of your turn while your opponent has 9(having previously said &quot;Keep going next round&quot;), you can stop the game and you are paid 7 points - the opponent's score is wasted. It called ''Abandoned block chain''

*	It is possible for the play to end without a winner. This can happen for example if no player manages to reach the target score, or if a player choose &quot;Keep going next round&quot; and then fails to increase his or her score (and no one else achieves 7 Points) before the cards run out. There is no payment for this deal. The cards are shuffled and the system deals again. It is called ''Waste Hashrate''

*	There are several circumstances in which the number of points paid to the winner is increased.

*	If the winner showed three cards of the same coin during the game of play or the winner did a coin if there was a same coin card on the screen, then opponent must pay double. If the winner showed two such sets, two doubles are applied, quadrupling the payment.

*	If the winner has a set of at least seven merchant card &amp; payment gateway card, then each opponent must pay double. It called ''No market''

*	If the winner has three set of exchange card &amp; get 7 points and an opponent don’t has any exchange card, each opponent pays double. It called ''Juck Coin''

*	If the winner has a set of at least ten mining cards, then any opponent with fewer than eight junk cards must pay double. For this purpose, the special Mining cards &amp; joker cards count as two, as for scoring. It is called ''No Hashrate''

*	If the winner previously chose &quot;Keep going next round&quot; once, opponent pays one extra point.

*	If the winner previously chose &quot;Keep going next round&quot; twice, opponent pays two extra points.

*	If the winner previously chose &quot;Keep going next round&quot; three times, each opponent pays double.

*	If the winner previously chose &quot;Keep going next round&quot; more than three times, the payment is doubled again for each &quot;Keep going next round&quot; beyond three.
When calculating payments, if the winner chose &quot;Keep going next round&quot; once or twice, the points for this are added before the doubles are applied. If the winner chose &quot;Keep going next round&quot; three or more times, the two points for the first two &quot;Keep going next round&quot; are added before doubling the payment. Doubles are cumulative - for example suppose you win with 7 merchant cards and 15 mining card, having chose &quot;Keep going next round&quot; three times. Your score is 9 points. You add two points for the first two &quot;keep going next round&quot;, making 11 points. An opponent who has less 8 mining card(''low hashrate'' Penalty) will pay you 88 points - there is one double for your 7 merchant(''No market'' Penalty)</text>

I moved to Canberra in 2013 to complete a degree at UC. Originally I come from a small country town in New South Wales. Sports and exercise has always been a major part of my life, where my older brother and I would normally travel in opposite directions for our respective sport. My goals for my time here at Uni is to complete my Undergraduate degree in Sports Coaching and Exercise Science, and also obtain a Masters in occupational Therapy.

====What is Down Syndrome?====

Down Syndrome is a genetic condition, it is caused by having an extra chromosome in there body. In the human body there are normally 46 chromosomes however in a person with down syndrome 47 chromosomes are present in the body, the extra chromosome is chromosome 21. There are many physical and mental characteristics that indicate down syndrome. down syndrome is classified at birth and confirmed by a blood test. &lt;ref&gt; Down Syndrome Victoria, What is Down Syndrome, Accessed From: http://www.downsyndromevictoria.org.au/DSAV/Information/About_Down_syndrome/What_is_Down_syndrome/DSAV/Information/What_is_Down_syndrome.aspx? &lt;/ref&gt;

====Prevalence====

In Australia about 13,000 people have down syndrome and that number is growing every day.&lt;ref&gt;Down Syndrome Australia Available from: http://www.downsyndrome.org.au/info.html &lt;/ref&gt;. It is estimated that 1 in 800 babies are born with Down Syndrome. &lt;ref&gt; Down Syndrome Association of Queensland Inc. Available From: http://www.dsaq.org.au/information-about-down-syndrome.htm &lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Lupus Erythematosus or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease &lt;ref name=&quot;prado&quot;&gt;Prado, D. M., Benatti, F. B., de Sá-Pinto, A. L., Hayashi, A. P., Gualano, B., Pereira, R. M., Roschel, H. (2013). Exercise training in childhood-onset systemic lupus erythematosus: a controlled randomized trial. Arthritis Research &amp; Therapy, 15(2), R46. &lt;/ref&gt;  that causes chronic inflammation and damage to body tissues including the renal, cardiovascular, neural, musculoskeletal, and cutaneous tissues &lt;ref name=&quot;sun&quot;&gt;Sun, L., Akiyama, K., Zhang, H., Yamaza, T., Hou, Y., Zhao, S.,  Shi, S. (2009). Mesenchymal stem cell transplantation reverses multiorgan dysfunction in systemic lupus erythematosus mice and humans. Stem Cells (Dayton, Ohio), 27(6), 1421-1432. doi: 10.1002/stem.68 &lt;/ref&gt;. It is associated with periods of active disease involvement and remission&lt;ref name=&quot;LIVINGSTON&quot;&gt;Livingston, B., Bonner, A., &amp; Pope, J. (2011). Differences in clinical manifestations between childhood-onset lupus and adult-onset lupus: a meta-analysis. Lupus, 20(13), 1345-1355. doi: 10.1177/0961203311416694 &lt;/ref&gt;. The severity and symptoms of the disease varies among patients however research has indicated that if the onset of the disease occurs during childhood or adolescents then the disease is more likely to be severe going into adulthood&lt;ref name=&quot;prado&quot;/&gt;. The cause of SLE is suggested to result from environmental and genetic factors that lead to a break down in the tolerance of the immune system&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggarwal&quot;&gt;Aggarwal, A., &amp; Srivastava, P. (2014). Childhood onset systemic lupus erythematosus: how is it different from adult SLE? International Journal of Rheumatic Diseases &lt;/ref&gt;. A common abnormality in this population is irregularities in their T and B lymphocytes &lt;ref name=&quot;sun&quot;/&gt;  &lt;ref name=&quot;deng&quot;&gt;Deng, Y., &amp; Tsao, B. P. (2010). Genetic susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus in the genomic era. Nature Reviews Rheumatology, 6(12), 683-692. &lt;/ref&gt;. In addition, an increase in IL-10 production in peripheral blood b cells and monocytes &lt;ref name=&quot;deng&quot;/&gt;,  and elevated levels of IFN- α are indicative of the presence SLE disease activity&lt;ref name=&quot;crow&quot;&gt;Crow, M. K. (2010). Interferon-alpha: a therapeutic target in systemic lupus erythematosus. Rheumatic Diseases Clinics of North America, 36(1), 173. doi: 10.1016/j.rdc.2009.12.008 &lt;/ref&gt;.

==Prevalence==

Research has indicated that the prevalence of SLE is greater in the female population of a child bearing age with a prevalence rate of 90%,&lt;ref&gt;Weckerle, C. E., &amp; Niewold, T. B. (2011). The unexplained female predominance of systemic lupus erythematosus: clues from genetic and cytokine studies. Clinical Reviews in Allergy &amp; Immunology, 40(1), 42-49. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;gordon&quot;&gt;Gordon, C., Li, C. K., &amp; Isenberg, D. A. (2010). Systemic lupus erythematosus. Medicine, 38(2), 73-80. doi: 10.1016/j.mpmed.2009.10.006&lt;/ref&gt; although the disease can occur at any stage of life&lt;ref name=&quot;LIVINGSTON&quot;/&gt;.  The characteristics of the disease are strongly influenced by environmental factors and this differs between racial and ethnic groups &lt;ref name=&quot;brunner&quot;&gt;Brunner, H. I., Gladman, D. D., Ibañez, D., Urowitz, M. D., &amp; Silverman, E. D. (2008). Difference in disease features between childhood-onset and adult-onset systemic lupus erythematosus. Arthritis &amp; Rheumatism, 58(2), 556-562. doi: 10.1002/art.23204 &lt;/ref&gt;. It has been indicated that children with SLE have a more active disease activity and a higher prevalence rate of renal damage and which occurs at a more rapid rate compared to adult onset SLE(A-SLE)&lt;ref name=&quot;brunner&quot;/&gt;.
 
Childhood onset SLE (C-SLE) is generally characterised by onset of symptoms before the age of 18 &lt;ref name=&quot;Aggarwal&quot;/&gt;. The onset of the disease has an around 15-20% prevalence in child populations&lt;ref name=&quot;LIVINGSTON&quot;/&gt; with 60% of those developing the disease after 10 years of age &lt;ref name=&quot;Aggarwal&quot;/&gt;.There is research to suggest that there is less gender bias towards females with C-SLE compared to adult onset&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggarwal&quot;/&gt;. However, C-SLE is thought to be more prevalent and severe in those of African, Asian, Hispanic and Native American descent&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggarwal&quot;/&gt;. It should be noted that not all studies support this finding.

===Main Signs and Symptoms Associated with C-SLE and A-SLE===

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
* Fatigue&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggarwal&quot;/&gt;
* Joint Pain and Swelling&lt;ref name=&quot;gordon&quot;/&gt;
* Weight loss&lt;ref name=&quot;gordon&quot;/&gt;
* Fever&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggarwal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gordon&quot;/&gt;
* Generalised lymphadenopathy&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggarwal&quot;/&gt;
* Raynaud’s Syndrome&lt;ref name=&quot;LIVINGSTON&quot;/&gt;
{{col-break}}
* Erythematous rash seen on both cheeks and bridge of nose&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggarwal&quot;/&gt;
* Photosensitive rash&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggarwal&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;LIVINGSTON&quot;/&gt;
* Oral ulcers&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggarwal&quot;/&gt;
* Serositis in the form of pleuritis&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggarwal&quot;/&gt;
* Pericarditis&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggarwal&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;LIVINGSTON&quot;/&gt;
* Cardiac Arrhythmias and Murmurs&lt;ref name=&quot;LIVINGSTON&quot;/&gt;
{{col-end}}

This is not exhaustive list of signs and symptoms as they will vary between patients.

==Current Treatments Available==

===Pharmaceutical===
Pharmaceutical treatment for this disease varies with the individual, their symptoms and severity.  Nonspecific drug treatments are the most common way to treat this disease &lt;ref name=&quot;yu&quot;&gt; Yu, Y., &amp; La Cava, A. (2011). Current drugs in systemic lupus erythematosus. Drug Development Research, 72(7), 561-572. doi: 10.1002/ddr.20466 &lt;/ref&gt; as currently there is no cure.  The current drug treatments used carry a significant risk of toxicity, cytopenia, infection and malignancy&lt;ref name=&quot;yu&quot;/&gt;. 
The drugs used include&lt;ref name=&quot;yu&quot;/&gt;:

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
* NSAIDS
* Anti – malarial drugs (Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine)
* Corticosteroids
* Immune Suppressant drugs (methotrexate)
* Cytotoxic drugs (cyclophosphamide)

Hematopoietic stem cell and Mesenchymal stem cells transplantations are used in the most severe cases in an attempt to restart the immune system&lt;ref name=&quot;yu&quot;/&gt; however it is not a cure but can improve the immune system activity&lt;ref name=&quot;yu&quot;/&gt;.

===Exercise===
In SLE patients exercise has been found to be an important non pharmaceutical treatment&lt;ref name=&quot;miossi&quot;&gt;Miossi, R., Benatti, F. B., Lúcia de Sá Pinto, A., Lima, F. R., Borba, E. F., Prado, D. M. L., Roschel, H. (2012). Using exercise training to counterbalance chronotropic incompetence and delayed heart rate recovery in systemic lupus erythematosus: A randomized trial. Arthritis Care &amp; Research, 64(8), 1159-1166. doi: 10.1002/acr.21678 &lt;/ref&gt;. Although undertaking exercise in this population can be difficult due to individuals suffering from chronic fatigue and pain and other comorbidities including premature atherosclerosis, dyslipidaemia  &lt;ref name=&quot;ardoin&quot;&gt;Ardoin, S. P., Sandborg, C., &amp; Schanberg, L. E. (2007). Management of dyslipidemia in children and adolescents with systemic lupus erythematosus. Lupus, 16(8), 618-626. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;perandini&quot;&gt;Perandini, L. A., Sales-de-Oliveira, D., Mello, S. B., Camara, N. O., Benatti, F. B., Lima, F. R.,  Gualano, B. (2014). Exercise training can attenuate the inflammatory milieu in women with systemic lupus erythematosus. Journal of Applied Physiology (Bethesda, Md.: 1985), 117(6), 639-647. doi: 10.1152/japplphysiol.00486.2014 [doi] &lt;/ref&gt; and insulin resistance&lt;ref name=&quot;perandini&quot;/&gt;.   This is due to the increased levels of IFN-γ, IL-6, TNF-α, IL-10, and sTNFRs that also increase the risk of cardiovascular disease &lt;ref name=&quot;perandini&quot;/&gt;.  Multiple other cardiac abnormalities can be found in SLE patients, including autonomic dysfunction, coronary heart disease and ischemic heart disease&lt;ref name=&quot;ayan&quot;&gt;Ayán, C., &amp; Martín, V. (2007). Systemic lupus erythematosus and exercise. In (pp. 5-9). England: Sage Publications. doi: 10.1177/0961203306074795. &lt;/ref&gt;.  Therefore exercise has been found to decrease the inflammatory response in SLE, as patients display decreased levels of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF α at rest post chronic exercise training&lt;ref name=&quot;perandini&quot;/&gt;.  

Cardiac abnormalities in SLE can also be reduced through exercise by:

{{col-begin|width=auto}}
{{col-break}}
* Improved aerobic capacity&lt;ref name=&quot;ayan&quot;/&gt;
* Improved cardiovascular functioning&lt;ref name=&quot;miossi&quot;/&gt;
* Reduced chronotropic incompetence&lt;ref name=&quot;miossi&quot;/&gt;
* Reduced delayed heart rate recovery&lt;ref name=&quot;miossi&quot;/&gt;

Furthermore, exercise has been found to be an effective management tool in treating dyslipidaemia as it improves lipid profiles in the TC/HDL-c ratio, VLDLc and LDL-c particle size&lt;ref name=&quot;ardoin&quot;/&gt;.  This is important as it is suggested that TNF- α, oxidation of LDL and abnormal chylomicron metabolism is involved in the deregulation lipoprotein lipase activity in SLE&lt;ref name=&quot;ardoin&quot;/&gt;.
 
====Exercise Recommendations====
Performing exercise in this population has been found to not cause flare ups in the disease activity or cause any other adverse effects&lt;ref name=&quot;tench&quot;&gt;Tench, C. M., McCarthy, J., McCurdie, I., White, P. D., &amp; D'Cruz, D. P. (2003). Fatigue in systemic lupus erythematosus: a randomized controlled trial of exercise. Rheumatology (Oxford, England), 42(9), 1050-1054. doi: 10.1093/rheumatology/keg289 [doi] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;miossi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;perandini&quot;/&gt;. Although this was stated from research in patients with inactive SLE&lt;ref name=&quot;tench&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;miossi&quot;/&gt;. Establishing an exercise program for this population is difficult due to the variety of symptoms and severity. Research has suggested that weight bearing exercise can improve bone mineral density in SLE as the disease causes an imbalance of IL-6 which is involved in accelerating bone remodelling&lt;ref name=&quot;ayan&quot;/&gt;. However, aerobic exercise has been found to be the most beneficial due to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in SLE&lt;ref name=&quot;miossi&quot;/&gt; but any form of physical activity would provide a physical and psychological improvement&lt;ref name=&quot;ayan&quot;/&gt;.

! General exercise programs considerations for SLE patients should involve:&lt;ref&gt;Neill, J., Belan, I., &amp; Ried, K. (2006). Effectiveness of non-pharmacological interventions for fatigue in adults with multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or systemic lupus erythematosus: a systematic review. Journal of Advanced Nursing, 56(6), 617-635. &lt;/ref&gt;!! Exercise Program Recommendations:&lt;ref name=&quot;ayan&quot;/&gt;
|-
| Starting the exercise early in the disease course or following a disease flare || Walking, 3 times a week at an intensity of 70% of maximum heart rate and progressively increase the duration
|-
| Beginning with low intensity activities to avoid flare ups||Swimming or stationary cycling, 3 times a week at an intensity of 70–80% of maximum heart rate
|-
| Progressively increase exercise intensity and frequency || Resistance training, three times a week of 2-3 sets of 10 reps isotonic contractions per muscle group with progression 
|-
| The medication the patient is on, may affect the response to exercise training

=Surveyor Workflow to create a route=
&lt;/div&gt;{{FUN-top|AM&amp;C=1}}
==Creation of a fictional layout==
This page provides a step by step guide to the '''Surveyor workflow''' and will guide you to create a simple Route and Session&amp;mdash;''as a ''''Programmed Instruction (PI) challenge'''' or module&amp;mdash; that could take just 10 minutes to create&amp;mdash;given a little practice and familiarity with the {{TL|Surveyor tools|Surveyor tool sets}}. 

The goal of this {{TG|PI-module}} is to help you learn-by-doing about {{TL|Surveyor Tools}} whilst doing something fun and creative. We and {{BL|''more importantly &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;''}} will be building on this introduction through several iterations of skills building challenges, so exercise care to master the tools as we introduce them, and spend some time experimenting. This page is directly inspired by the recent belated addition of {{HT|Create_a_Route_in_10_Minutes|the similar page}} on the TrainzOnline wiki put up by N3V CEO Tony Hilliam. Some of the editor's suspect the general workflow goes back to the examples in all the Trainz retail releases 'Manual' documentation from {{TL|Trainz}} to the forthcoming {{TL|TANE}}.
&amp;nbsp;
{{TrainzTip|In a September Skype voice conference 3 of 4 long experienced Trainzer's were surprised to find that the Trainz Manuals booklet was also included in the TS10 and TS12 releases in the folder ''''extras\manuals'''' off the install's root as a pdf resource! As new Trainzer's, we suggest opening that with {{TG|freeware}} {{TL|Foxit}} and have that searchable resource open and ready on your second head or by {{Kp|ALT|TAB}} and {{Kp|SHIFT|ALT|TAB}} switching while learning Trainz!}}
&amp;nbsp;

==Naming your Route==
;TS2010&amp;ndash;TS2012
: To begin, click Start Trainz from the Launcher then {{kp|Click-LMB}} on “Create Route” at the bottom of the Routes screen. 
: Enter the {{TL|Main Menu}} and select {{TL|Surveyor}}. In the {{TL|Surveyor Menu}}, {{Kp|Click-LMB|Create New}}. 
;All
The display will have a dialog API box with the top line &quot;&lt;u&gt;New Route&lt;/u&gt;&quot; already highlighted. 
;All: Change the name of the route '''(Suggest: &quot;The Ten minute route-M000&quot;)''' then 
::A) accept the defaults provided in the dialog by clicking the {{mb|Checkmark}}, as the (source) route building tutorial page on the Trainz Wiki suggests. '''Or,''' take the advice of users experienced with running the program and developing a route from stage to stage over the years and so...''
::B) Reposition to the Session name, and give it a good title too. (We're using ''&quot;Figure Eight rail-tripping-m000&quot;) 

:::B2) Call the session (whimsically descriptive, we think) &quot;Figure Eight Rail-tripping-M000&quot;
{{TTip| Yes! On session names too! You'll thank us later! If you don't, the various Save As occasions, will give too many routes with the same identical name, so distinguish them now! One of those ''''''good practices'''''' people adopt after getting hurt! Protect thyself!
}}
{{LeftBox|BG=#fae7e7|Suggest Thinking ahead,... Let's assume a first route eventually developed along the lines of a basement Model Railroad Empire, 6-9 {{TG|B|baseboards}} to 16 (4x4).
'''Our 'draft' specification:''' We want to develop a map with figure eight center section, one feature of which will allow reversal of direction and a perimeter oval with a passing siding, small yard(s), some industrial spurs feeding interactive businesses and a town scene with a few grade crossings. All dominated by a mountain and foot hills terrain, giving a number of places where we need bridges and somewhere, a tunnel, a lake and river system, and a couple of Train Stations.
* Keep that ''long term goal'' in mind and perhaps sketch something out on paper as a target&amp;mdash;we'll return to the concept as a project from time to time here and this is part of your assigned tasking.
* {{Col|'''For the moment, we're resuming with our initial one board project.'''|blue}}
}}
:::B3) Select a region--intro: {{TL|region}} &amp; reference: {{TR|K|region}}, this selection is important for traffic ({{TG|TrainzCarz}}) and the look-see-feel, including season's effects, time calculations based on Latitude and Longitude, and other realism factors. We suggest United States (as our tutorials about the built-from-scratch together example map will be) or another Continent scale region; without having downloaded from the DLS, your basic choices are currently tightly limited.
;All
: {{Col|Your blank baseboard awaits...|blue}} 


{{TrainzTip|BG=white|'''On experimenting and safing your work'''. &quot;''Nothing is quite as disconcerting as finding after three or five hours intensive trial and error... 'you just can't get there from here... and you've ruined what you had trying.''&quot;
&amp;nbsp;
When you get a notion that you aren't sure you can make work, save the files; Then immediately ''''''Save As'''' again or soon after you start your experiment.'' This is called being safe, being prudent, or by programmers, {{BL|'safing your work'}} (state).
* &lt;u&gt;Experiment&lt;/u&gt; by all means, but make sure to safe your work before making radical changes that might not be easy to recover from. Bad enough to loose hours in a failed trial, but it's much worse when you have no way to back up to the status quo ante without having a backup to go back to.
* '''Key Point:''' Surveyor saves in pairs - it always wants a {{TL|session}} associated as a {{TG|dependency}} with a {{TR|K|map|Trainz Map (Route)}} asset. So it makes one.
* So protect your time--Save often, and use a different suffix for a project using a two or three digit suffix (the 'M00' above, for &quot;Mod-00&quot;, meaning a modification with zero significant changes. }}
{{mb|Load}}
{{TRS-underconstruction}}
==Making Mountains==
Click the Topology Tab &lt;big&gt;{{col|({{kp| F1 }})|blue}}&lt;/big&gt; then the {{TRST|Height Up tool}}. 
Click-{{kp|LMB}} on the radius knob, and drag it until the dial is in about the 12 o’clock position.  Do the same for the sensitivity dial. 
Move the mouse cursor into the 3D world and it changes into a dotted circle called the “circle of influence”.
Click and hold {{kp|LMB}} and a hill will begin to form. The longer you hold the {{kp|LMB}} the higher the hill becomes. 
Move the mouse around while holding {{kp|LMB}} and you can create various peaks and ridges. 
Tip: Use the Undo/Redo buttons ({{kp|CTRL}}-{{kp|Z}}/{{kp|CTRL}}-{{kp|Y}}) that are found on the top menu panel to retrace your steps if you make a mistake.

==Ground Texturing==
Click-{{kp|LMB}} on the Paint Tab &lt;big&gt;{{col|({{kp| F2 }})|blue}}&lt;/big&gt; and the Topology menu is replaced by the Paint menu. 
Use the scroll bar to scroll through the texture palette or type in the edit box to look for a specific texture.
{{kp|LMB}} to select a texture and it will show between the Direction and Scale dials. Click-{{kp|LMB}} and drag to apply the texture to the terrain.
Select and apply a different texture and play with blending textures (overlapping), rotating them using the “Direction” tool (or the &lt;big&gt;{{kp| [ }}&lt;/big&gt; or &lt;big&gt;{{kp| ] }}&lt;/big&gt; keys). 
Change the size of the pattern (the scale of the texture) by using the Scale tool (or {{kp|CTRL}}-{{kp| [ }} or {{kp|CTRL}}-{{kp| ] }}). 
Change the size of the area being painted using the Radius tool or the &lt;big&gt;{{kp| + }}&lt;/big&gt; or &lt;big&gt;{{kp| - }}&lt;/big&gt; keys.

==Placing Objects==
Select the Object tab &lt;big&gt;{{col|({{kp| F3 }})|blue}}&lt;/big&gt; from the tab panel and select an object. As you click on an object from the list, a small 3D preview appears in the preview window.
The Add Object mode (&lt;big&gt;{{kp| A }}&lt;/big&gt;) is enabled by default. Click in the world to place the object.
Use the Move and Rotate tools by first enabling the tool in the Menu then click dragging the object in the 3D world. 
Tip: Save regularly in Surveyor to ensure you don’t lose your work should the unforseen happen.

==Laying Track==
Select the Track tab &lt;big&gt;{{col|({{kp| F4 }})|blue}}&lt;/big&gt; and choose the track “TS15 Trk Oak V6”. Ensure you are in Add Track mode and lay a short section of track by clicking twice on the baseboard; firstly where you want to start the track, and then where you want it to end. 
The white circle at each end of the track is called a “Spline Point”. Click on the Move tool &lt;big&gt;{{col|({{kp| M }})|blue}}&lt;/big&gt; and click and drag one of the spline points. Notice that the track follows you. Release the {{kp|LMB}} where you want to place the spline point.
Select the Add tool again, a click-{{kp|LMB}} on a spline point (the white circle). As you move your mouse away you will see the track is being extended. Click again on the map to complete the second track segment. 
Next click on the Straighten Track tool &lt;big&gt;{{col|({{kp| B }})|blue}}&lt;/big&gt; then click on one of the spline segments between the spline point circles. The track is immediately straightened. Try each of the other tools including the advanced tools to insert, raise and lower spline points and even to smooth the ground under the track.

==Adding a Turnout==
In the Track Tab, click-{{kp|LMB}} on the Add Track button, and then click on a section of your existing track in between two spline points. A new spline point appears and you can now Click-{{kp|LMB}} again, away from the exisiting track, to create your turnout. 
Use the Move tool to position the direction of the track to give the best appearance. Notice that the check rails and sleepers are placed automatically, and move as you move the rail.

==Adding a Lever==
Trainz will automatically add in a junction lever, which controls the direction of the junction, whenever you create a junction. The Red and Green arrows indicate which way the turnout will be set when you begin to operate your new Route. 
To change the turnout’s default direction when in Driver, select the “Junction Direction” &lt;big&gt;{{col|({{kp| J }})|blue}}&lt;/big&gt; found in the Trackside menu &lt;big&gt;{{col|({{kp| Y }})|blue}}&lt;/big&gt; then click on the arrows to toggle the direction.
Note: The Switch lever can be deleted using the Trackside Object Delete function, but you must replace it with another of your choice if the Turnout is to function properly. 

==Adding Spline Objects==
Just like adding track, it is possible to lay roads, fences and other spline based objects. Click on the Objects Tab and then click on the Spline tool. Follow the same process as laying track to lay down a road and a fence alongside the road.

==Understanding Session Components==
Now that we have created some terrain, scenery and track, it is time to move onto the “Session” components - the variable parts of the experience such as the locos and Rules governing how the Session will operate. 
A Session can be as simple as driving a specific train from Point A to Point B or as complex as the author desires. As the Session author, all the decisions are up to you. 
To set up a Session, the author needs to decide upon a range of factors including:
*the route (which part of the world) where the session will take place
*the locations on the route (are you going from one end to the other or working in a single section of the route?)
*the quantity and selection of locos and rolling stock
*the driving mode required
*placement of trackside cameras 
*placement of trackmarks and triggers 
*level of instruction provided to the user
*what penalties will be applied for poor performance
*whether scoring will be used

==Changing to Session Layer==
When you create a new Route, you are by default working in the Route Layer. Anything in the Route Layer is also present in any Session created for the Route.
To switch to working in a Session layer, open the Layers tab  &lt;big&gt;{{col|({{kp| F6 }})|blue}}&lt;/big&gt;. Click the Session-Layer entry and any objects you add will now be placed in the Session layer. 

==Adding Locos &amp; Rolling Stock ==
Select the Trains Tab &lt;big&gt;{{col|({{kp| F7 }})|blue}}&lt;/big&gt;, select a locomotive from the list then Click-{{kp|LMB}} on any position on the track to place the locomotive in the 3D world. Arrows will appear above the loco defining which direction will be “forward” in your Driver Session.
Next, select a freight car from your list of rolling stock. Click-{{kp|LMB}} on the track just behind the placed locomotive. Keep on Clicking {{kp|LMB}} just behind the last car in the consist to add cars. 
Lastly, add one more loco which will be our “AI Driver”

==Adding a Trackmark ==
Select the Track Tab &lt;big&gt;{{col|({{kp| F4 }})|blue}}&lt;/big&gt;, then the Trackmark Mode &lt;big&gt;{{col|({{kp| V }})|blue}}&lt;/big&gt;. Select a a trackmark and click on your track ahead of your AI loco. Click on the Checkmark to accept the default name of the trackmark and close the window.

==Assigning a Driver==
To define how your Session will operate, click on the “Edit Session Rules” icon ({{kp|CTRL|R}}).  There are 6 default rules already included and these are configured so it is possible to start a Session and run it without any amendments.
Click-{{kp|LMB}} on {{col|{{kp| Driver Setup }} Rule|blue}}, then Click-{{kp|LMB}} on the Edit button to open the Properties window for that rule. This Rule is responsible for assigning driver characters to each train placed on the tracks for the Session. 
Click on the driver character icon (not the name) to bring up a list of drivers. Choose any driver from the list and click on the Checkmark to return back to the Driver Setup rule properties window. The driver you chose is now assigned to the locomotive.

==Issuing Commands==
Next we are going to add a driver command. Click on the green arrow in the command area. Choose Drive to trackmark from the list and then choose the Trackmark you just placed. When your sessin starts, your driver will head for that trackmark.
Close the Driver Setup rule properties window by clicking {{kp|LMB}} on the Checkmark. Then exit the Edit Session window with changes saved by clicking {{kp|LMB}} on the tick near the bottom right corner.

==Save and QuickDrive==
Click-{{kp|LMB}} on {{col|{{kp| Main Menu }}|violet}} and Click-{{kp|LMB}} on the Save option to save your creation and make it available in the Routes and Sessions lists.
To jump straight into your Driver Session from Surveyor (and back again into Surveyor when you are done driving), Click-{{kp|LMB}}  on the {{col|{{kp|QuickDrive}}|violet}} icon ({{kp|CTRL}}-{{kp|'''F2'''}}). 

==Troubleshooting==
The Driver mode will now be loaded and the route you just created will appear with your two trains. Your camera will be focused on one train, and the AI Driver will be operating the other one, heading for the trackmark.
If this isn’t happening, choose Main Menu &gt; Exit Driver and you will load back into Surveyor to make any adjustments. Re-read this section to see which aspect you may need to change.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is diabetes? ==
====  Prevalence ====
Type II diabetes is a disease that affects the metabolic system of the human body. Type II diabetes is the most common form of diabetes affecting 85-90% of people who have diabetes&lt;ref name=&quot;Diabetes Aus&quot;&gt;1.Diabetes Australia. Type 2 Diabetes [Internet]. Canberra: Diabetes Australia; 2013 [cited 2014 September 1]. Available from: http://www.diabetesaustralia.com.au/Understanding-Diabetes/What-is-Diabetes/Type-2-Diabetes/&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2014, there were approximately 981 000 people in Australia living with type II diabetes&lt;ref&gt;2.National Diabetes Service Scheme. Data Snapshot [Internet]. Canberra: Diabetes Australia; 2014 [cited 2014 September 1]. Available from: http://www.ndss.com.au/Global/Data%20Snapshots/June%202014/NDSS-NartionalSnapshots-30June2014-TYPE2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and this number is projected to increase as more Australians continue to gain weight and live poor lifestyles. In people with type II diabetes their pancreas either cannot produce enough usable insulin or the insulin it does produce cannot be used properly by the body. Insulin is an important hormone, its role in the body is to help regulate glucose levels in the blood as it induces cells to express glucose channels to uptake glucose from the blood into the cell &lt;ref name=&quot;Diabetes Aus&quot;/&gt;.

====  How we get it ====
There is no single cause of type II diabetes, however both genetics and environmental factors increase the risk of getting type II diabetes. In people who have a genetic predisposition of diabetes, there risk of getting type II diabetes is greatly increased if the individual:
* Is overweight or obese, 
* Has high blood pressure,
* Has low physical activity levels, and 
* Consumes a poor diet regularly &lt;ref&gt;3.Better Health Channel. Diabetes Type 2 [Internet]. Melbourne: Better Health Channel; 2014 [cited 2014 September 2]. Available from: http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Diabetes_Type_2&lt;/ref&gt;.

====  Who is at risk ====
Screening usually occurs in people over the age of 40 by their GP as a way of monitoring potential cases however, these particular population groups are at higher risk of getting type II diabetes:
* Those with family history
* Over age 55
* Are overweight or obese and have high blood pressure and known heart problems
* Over 35 and have an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander background
* Over 35 and have a Pacific Island, Chinese or Indian background and, 
* Women who have had gestational diabetes &lt;ref&gt;4.NPS Medicinewise. Who is at risk of type 2 diabetes? [Internet]. Surrey Hills: Department of Health; 2011 [cited 2014 September 2].

====  How we manage it ====
As type II diabetes is also known as “lifestyle” diabetes, the risk is lowered in people who: have a stable healthy weight, manage blood pressure, exercise regularly and, avoiding foods high in fats and salts &lt;ref name=&quot;Diabetes Aus&quot;/&gt;.

== Exercise and how it effects the body ==
==== How exercise helps prevention ====
Exercise is an important tool in the management and prevention of type II diabetes without the reliance of insulin&lt;ref&gt;5.Hordern M, Marwick T, Wood P, Cooney L, Prins J, Coombes J. Acute response of blood glucose to short-term exercise training in patients with type 2 diabetes. Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport [Internet]. 2011 May [cited September 3];14(3):238-242. Available from: http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.canberra.edu.au/science/article/pii/S1440244010009114&lt;/ref&gt;.

The benefits of exercising if you have diabetes include; increases in insulin sensitivity, glycaemic control, increased aerobic capacity and weight loss&lt;ref name=&quot;Jorge M&quot;&gt;7.Jorge M, de Oliveira V, Resende N et al.

The more intense the aerobic exercise the better the results in glycaemic control and insulin sensitivity. The effect of resistance training is a relatively new area of study and there has been mixed results with some indicating improvements while others did not show significant changes&lt;ref name=&quot;Bweir S&quot;&gt;8.Bweir S, Al-Jurrah M et al. Resistance exercise training lowers HbA1c more than aerobic training in adults with type 2 diabetes. Diabetology &amp; metabolic syndrome [Internet]. 2009 [cited 2014 September]; 1(1): 27-34.

One way that exercise helps with improving blood glucose levels is by increasing the uptake of glucose from the blood into the muscle cell using the GLUT-4 transporter. The GLUT-4 transporter is moved from the centre of the cell to the outer cell membrane during exercise. This shift of GLUT 4 is independent of insulin and as a result the number of this transporter increases by nearly 4 times as much compared to levels before exercise. This increase in GLUT 4 transporters will help improve insulin sensitivity in the body &lt;ref name=&quot;Jorge M&quot;/&gt;, with the effect lasting anywhere from 24 to 72 hours post exercise which is why it is recommended to not have more than 2 consecutive days off exercising&lt;ref name=&quot;Sigal R&quot;&gt;9.Sigal R, Kenny G, Wasserman D et al. Physical Activity/Exercise and Type 2 Diabetes - A consensus statement from the American Diabetes Association. Diabetes Care [Internet]. 2006 [cited 2014  September 8];29(6): 1433 – 1438. Available from: http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/29/6/1433&lt;/ref&gt;.

Glycated haemoglobin or HbA1C is the amount haemoglobin that has glucose attached to it. The more glucose in the blood stream the higher the HbA1C levels a person will have. A HbA1C test gives you an average blood glucose reading over the lifespan of haemoglobin &lt;ref name=&quot;diabetes UK&quot;&gt;10.Diabetes.co.uk. What is HbA1C [Internet]. [place unknown]; diabetes.co.uk; 2014 [cited 2014 September 18]. Available from: http://www.diabetes.co.uk/what-is-hba1c.html&lt;/ref&gt;. This test is the gold standard in measuring glycaemic control&lt;ref&gt;11.Phillips P. HbA1c and monitoring glycaemia. Australian Family Physician [Internet]. 2012 [cited 2014 September 18];41(1-2): 37-40. Available from: http://search.informit.com.au.ezproxy.canberra.edu.au/fullText;dn=875689045179850;res=IELHEA&lt;/ref&gt; and gives a longer term picture of blood glucose levels rather than the levels at a particular time like with a normal blood glucose test. A person without diabetes will have a HbA1C reading of approximately 5% whilst those with type II diabetes should aim to keep theirs around 6.5% &lt;ref name=&quot;diabetes UK&quot;/&gt;. Several studies have shown decreases in the HbA1C levels in people with type II diabetes after exercise  &lt;ref name=&quot;Bweir S&quot;/&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;12.Cauza E, Hanusch-Enserer U et al. The Relative Benefits of Endurance and Strength Training on the Metabolic Factors and Muscle Function of People With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation [Internet]. 2005 [cited 2014 September 8];86(8): 1527-1533. Available from: http://www.sciencedirect.com.ezproxy.canberra.edu.au/science/article/pii/S0003999305002121&lt;/ref&gt;. Both aerobic and resistance training, have shown a decrease in HbA1C levels after only a 10 week program. However, it is the resistance training that has a greater decrease compared to aerobic exercise. One study showed a decrease of nearly 20% in HbA1C levels in resistance exercise compared to only an 8% decrease in aerobic exercise &lt;ref name=&quot;Bweir S&quot;/&gt;.

A combination of resistance and aerobic exercise is best.

== Conclusion ==
Type II diabetes is a common disease affecting thousands of people, although there is a large genetic influence in contracting diabetes, it can be prevented or managed with lifestyle changes. Exercise is an important tool in preventing and managing type II diabetes. It is recommended that both aerobic and resistance training be undertaken to achieve maximum results.

:''This page is an expanded and explained version of the official {{N3V|Trainz_Life-Cycle_Policy|Trainz Life-Cycle Policy}}. It also incorporates information gleaned from N3V official staff in response to {{N3F|url=http://forums.auran.com/trainz/forum.php|forums.auran.com threads}}.''

Auran typically maintain support for major product releases for four years from the initial release date. This is known as the &quot;end-of-support&quot; date for the product. Support includes the following areas:
{{TRS-underconstruction}}
* Product-specific information, downloads, and utilities on the Auran web site.
* Product assistance through the Auran Helpdesk.
* Maintenance of product-specific forums.
* Access to the [[Download Station]].
* Access to the iTrainz network.
* Access to other product-specific network services.

After the end-of-support date for a given product release, some or all of the above services may be immediately withdrawn at Auran's discretion. Any services which remain active may be withdrawn at any time thereafter. Users are encouraged to upgrade to a more recent version of Trainz to maintain support.

=FAQ's from the forum's (Q&amp;A) =
(&quot;WBA&quot; is Wikibooks editor's answer!)

'''Q: ''Will the named products continue to operate after the listed end-of-support date?'''''

:'''A:''' We will do nothing specific to prevent the products from operating. However, if they were to stop working for some reason (for example, they were found to be incompatible with the latest Windows Operating System) we would not take any steps to resolve the issue. Additionally, any product features which rely on server support (for example, in-game [[Download Station]] access or iTrainz) may cease functioning correctly.
'''WBA:''' Yes, why would software on your install stop because some company decided to ''TRY TO force'' people to buy newer software?

'''Q: ''Can I still access the Download Station after the end-of-support date?'''''

:'''A:''' Access granted to you by the unsupported product may be terminated. If you have purchased access through other means (newer products, [[First Class Ticket]], etc.) then your access will continue thanks to these products.
'''WBA:''' If you have any registered version, and maintain a FCT subscription, there will be a way to download. Summer of 2014 forum threads suggest they instead swerved to a second new DLS, as suggested by Fabartus (here), and that will be the sole FTP CM access for {{TL|TANE}}. They may extend FTP access, perhaps by a service pack (TS12-SP2 has long been called for by users, ''but for bug fixes''!) might be ''forced'' upon the user community for the TS12 and the MAC releases, but as of September, they are spawning a second 'Whitepages' DLS for the 64-bit machines and only vetted content that is thoroughly debugged ONLY will be allowed thereon. (See the DLS Cleanup Project) This newer DLS went operable in July&amp;ndash;August 2014.

'''Q: ''Can I still access the Download Station from within Trainz, Trainz Helper, or [[Content Manager]] after the end-of-support date?'''''

:'''A:''' Access to our servers from an unsupported product is not guaranteed, regardless of your level of Download Station access. You may need to download the content separately and then manually move it into the unsupported Trainz installation.
'''WBA:''' Translation. This company won't commit to policy's in advance for anything much. This weasel wording is a typical.
 
Forums intellegence says the Black Pages DLS will stay available and so content can be imported after the FTP transactions. TRS2006 evinced irregularities in expected downloads from early July, so DLS server changes seem to be in place and automatically updating data requests to inappropriate higher trainz-builds in some cases.
 
Other times, other versions this has not happened, so this editor blocked in T'06 was able to download the KUIDs in TS09 or TS10. Bottom line, Auran's IT staff have shortcomings, and you learn to live with odd behaviors for a time. Put in a ticket when something should work and complain loudly on the forums, so others can join your voice with theirs.


'''Q: ''Will the Download Station continue to host content for Trainz editions beyond their end-of-support date?'''''

:'''A:''' We will not immediately remove older content from the Download Station, as newer editions of Trainz can still use this content.

'''WBA:''' Worrisome answer? Or just more weasel wording, because of some proposal one day around the water cooler or a staff meeting. No policies in advance seems to be a watchword of Tony Hilliam and his staff toes the line. Per Tony's announcement of the TANE, most expect the Black Pages DLS to go on. 


'''Q: ''Will I be able to upload old-format content to the Download Station?'''''

:'''A:''' New uploads to the Download Station must be in a format no older than our oldest supported product. Attempts to upload content with a trainz-build number lower than our oldest supported product will be rejected. This ensures that legacy formats are cleanly phased out over time.

'''WBA:''' NO! Version jumped from V2.9 acceptable to V3.5 minimum on 1 September 2014. Despite a lot of forum noise and protests.


'''Q: ''Will my Lifetime First Class Ticket continue to operate if all my registered products are beyond their end-of-support date?'''''

:'''A:''' Yes, we will ensure that all users who have a right to Download Station access can continue to download content. The specific techniques required to download content may change. At the current time, we offer support for using an FCT with the DLS web site to manually download content. We do not offer support for using an FCT with Content Manager (or similar) in an unsupported product. We do not offer support for installing manually-downloaded content into an unsupported product.

'''WBA:''' Smells like the CM support for older versions is very threatened, should they find a rationale. Note the FTP access to the folders, a much more primative facility will stay in place. This says they want CM features with different data handling, so figure DRM and DLS protections are driving the changes--and the whole Trainz Life-Cycle policy is likely dreamt up so they could garner more cash from such content.


'''Q: ''I recently bought a copy of an unsupported product. Will you give support?'''''

:'''A:''' No. We will not sell products which are nearing the end-of-support date. It may be possible to purchase such a product from a third party through a bargain-bin outlet or similar, however we can not offer support for these products. We expect that the product will continue to operate as normal, and hope that you enjoy your experience with the product will be sufficiently enjoyable that you'll decide to upgrade to one of our supported products.

'''WBA:''' They never have, so you are in good company. Buy any older versions you don't have and can get at a good price while they last. Each has their place and use. 


'''Q: ''My only Trainz product will shortly become unsupported. Will my forum access be removed?'''''

:'''A:''' No. We're not in the business of kicking our loyal users out of the community. We really think it would be beneficial if you upgraded to a supported version of Trainz, but that's a decision that you'll have to make. The product-specific forum may be removed, but your overall forum access will remain valid.
'''WBA:''' Removing a popular product specific forum is also unlikely.


'''Q: ''Will the Download Station website be removed?'''''

:'''A:''' The Download Station website is not tied to a specific product. Our plans for this website are not affected by the end-of-support for any specific Trainz product. Your access to the Download Station is conditional upon having a supported product or other form of access such as a First Class Ticket. We expect to continue support and development of our web services indefinitely, although the exact form of these services may change over time.

'''WBA:''' As above, the Black Pages website appear safe, but may be restricted by CM handshaking desires. (September 3rd 2014)

      <comment>Copied from Cookbook: Vegan Cuisine.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Vegan cuisine uses no animal products, such as meat, dairy, eggs, or honey. This is more restrictive than vegetarian cuisine, which allows non-meat animal products. All vegan recipes are therefore vegetarian, though not all vegetarian meals are vegan. See Wikipedia's Veganism article for reasons why people are vegan, the history of veganism, and other vegan-related information.

Vegans should be attentive to their intake of vitamins B (especially B12) and D, calcium, iodine, and fatty acids. The Vegan Society's nutrition pages have more detailed information on this subject. See also Vegan nutrition on Wikipedia.

When preparing non-vegan recipes in accordance with a vegan diet, meat, eggs, honey, and dairy are replaced with a substitute ingredient. Substitute ingredients try to replicate the taste and texture of an ingredient or its other useful properties. Substituting for an ingredient works to greater or lesser degrees, depending upon the recipe, and some ingredients are almost impossible to replace. For more information see Vegan Substitutions.

Many vegans choose to avoid specialty substitute ingredients, as these products are often highly processed and high in sodium and allergen ingredients. Cooking with wholefoods such as unprocessed legumes, grains, nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables can be a healthier approach to veganism. Many non-vegans will also enjoy these foods. Vegans often find that cooking 'real' foods rather than substitutes result in higher quality, better tasting meals that appeal to vegans and non-vegans alike.</text>

{{Trainz-cat|noadmin=1|1={{Template category}}
This category holds various Trainz &lt;u&gt;'''Link Forming'''&lt;/u&gt; template tools, written primarily to ease interdivision linking within the book and maintain page portability to the N3V Wiki at the same time.
* These are the &lt;u&gt;preferred method&lt;/u&gt; of making interior links within the work per [[Trainz/Project]], and much thought has been given their common syntaxes, parameters, and interactions. A page formed by such links can be ported with minimal changes to the TrainzOnline Wiki where complementary templates of the same names map local links correctly.
* A template placement which misses the referenced page classification, needs but a few characters changed to make a valid link, and all form short, neat, easier to read &amp;  look past coding enabling easier concentration on editing the prose. 
* This ensures a tutorial here, can be ported to the HowTo pages there and still make common cross links to [[:category:Trainz reference pages|Trainz reference pages]].
* These tools including external links, and navigation box templates are also locatable under the [[:category:Trainz typing-aid templates|parent  category of typing aids]] as well.
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;div style={{TRS-style|W=105%|M=0|P=0

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Useful Controls: Text Widgets=

We have just covered the common 'selection widgets' - widgets that allow users to make a selection from among a fixed number of options that we have provided.
The 'text widgets' - which will be the subject of this chapter - are more free-form; they allow the user to enter potentially arbitrary strings of text.

Text widgets have two major uses.
Perhaps most simply, we may use them as 'displays' - as our program runs, we will update the text in a text widget with progress messages from our program.
This allows us a basic form of dynamic communication with the user; it is rarely the preferred approach for communicating with the user, but is very useful as a cheap, stopgap output system during application development.
The other use for text widgets is to allow the user to enter text, from file names to messages.

Some systems provide very sophisticated text-formatting facilities; these are beyond the scope of discussion for this document.
Still, readers should be aware that their platform's text-entry widgets might be 'very' sophisticated, and should check their platform's documentation for more information.

==The TextLine Widget==

There are two major text entry widgets; the multi-line entry and the single-line entry.
We will first concern ourselves with the single-line text entry.
Usually, the single-line entry will be very simple; it's primary purpose is to allow the user to entry a single value, such as a URL, a file path or a parameter string.
(As such, they are commonly coupled with some kind of file-chooser dialog; we will discus dialogs, including the file-chooser dialog, later.)

Because the TextLine widget only allows the user to enter a single line of text, it affords us the opportunity to treat it as a special event if the user presses the &quot;return&quot; key.
Unfortunately, toolkits very significantly as to how they achieve this; some kits' TextEntries will offer us an &lt;code&gt;enter_pressed&lt;/code&gt; event, while others will trigger the form's 'default action' automatically, without ever raising an event that we handle in our code.

Of note is that the TextLine is the first widget that we have seen that can grow.
The previous Button widgets had fixed preferred sizes, that were functions of their contents (for example, that were determined from their text labels in the case of a simple button).
TestLines, on the other hand, can potentially grow and shrink, at least horizontally.

==The TextBox Widget==

The TextBox allows the user to enter multiple rows of text.
The TextBoxes provided by most kits are very sophisticated; their full capabilites are arguably beyond the scope of this text.
For our purposes, we will ignore most of the events that they might offer us, and focus mainly on their &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; property, which will allow us to retrieve the text in them (if the user is entering text) or add to the text in them (if we are using the TextBox as a display).

The TextBox is the first widget that we have seen that can grow both horizontally 'and vertically'; it is also the first widget that we have seen that is 'scrollable'.
All of the previous controls have some minimum size that is a function of their contents; a Button, for example, must be given at least enough space on the screen to display its label.
We can easily imagine a scenario where we enter more text in a TextBox than can be displayed on screen.
Rather than require the text box to resize, the TextBox (in most kits) can display 'scroll bars' when its contents grow too large to display in the area available to it in the layout.
(In most kits, this capability is enabled by default, and will be triggered automatically without our intervention.)

Frequently, we can select whether the text box should 'always' display scroll bars, 'never' display scroll bars, or display them 'automatically' when the text in the TextBox becomes too large to fit on-screen.
This last setting is 'usually' the &quot;right answer,&quot; and so is usually the default.

==Marking Text Boxes as Editable==

TextBoxes have one other property of particular interest, whether or not they are 'editable'.
The &lt;code&gt;editable&lt;/code&gt; property will determine whether or not the user is able to type text in the &lt;code&gt;TextBox&lt;/code&gt;
If we are using the &lt;code&gt;TextBox&lt;/code&gt; as a display, we should usually mark the text box as not editable; this way, the user cannot, for example, accidentally delete our log messages.
In most kits, even if the &lt;code&gt;TextBox&lt;/code&gt; is not editable, it will still be possible for the user to select the text in the text box; this is useful so that they can copy our log messages, for example.

Note that the 'editability' of a &lt;code&gt;TextBox&lt;/code&gt; is a separate concern from whether or not it is &lt;code&gt;Enabled&lt;/code&gt;.
If a &lt;code&gt;TextBox&lt;/code&gt; is disabled, neither the developer nor the programmer will be able to interact with it, regardless of its editability setting.
We will revisit the subject of 'disabling' widgets later.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">For this chapter, we have a calculator willing to perform more calculations than you are willing to input.

==Code==
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main()
{
	std::string input;
	float a, b;
	char oper;
	float result;
	
	// The ultimate truism, this never stops being true.
	while(true)
	{
		std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter two numbers and an operator (+ - * /).\nOr press Ctrl+C to exit.\n&quot;;
		
		// Take input.
		std::cin &gt;&gt; input;
		// Parse it as a float.
		a = std::stof(input);

		// Take input.
		std::cin &gt;&gt; input;
		// Parse it as a float.
		b = std::stof(input);

		// Take input.
		std::cin &gt;&gt; input;
		// Get the first character.
		oper = input[0];

		switch (oper)
		{
		case '+':
			result = a + b;
			break;
		case '-':
			result = a - b;
			break;
		case '*':
			result = a * b;
			break;
		case '/':
			result = a / b;
			break;
		}

		std::cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; oper &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; &quot; = &quot; &lt;&lt; result &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
	}
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Explanation==
This program will run until your terminal stops running it (because you press Ctrl+C, or click the X). That's because the '''while loop''', every time control reaches its bottom, jumps back up to the top - ''if'' its condition is still true, which it always will be in this case.

If we weren't in a context where the user could easily halt the loop, the &lt;code&gt;while(true)&lt;/code&gt; would be a very bad idea. Instead of &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt;, you can put any Boolean expression (like &lt;code&gt;a == b&lt;/code&gt;) or &lt;code&gt;bool&lt;/code&gt; variable between the parentheses.

Suppose we wanted to allow up to ten '''iterations''' (passes through the loop) instead of an unlimited number. We could do this:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int i = 0;
while(i &lt; 10)
{
    //...
    i++;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
And that would work just fine.

&lt;code&gt;i++&lt;/code&gt; is the same thing as &lt;code&gt;i = i + 1&lt;/code&gt;, and results in &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; being one greater than it was. It's also the same as &lt;code&gt;i += 1&lt;/code&gt;.

But C++ provides a prettier way to write that, the '''for loop''':
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++)
{
    //...
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
For the first iteration, &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; will have the value 0. For the last iteration, it will have the value 9. It will never (usefully) have the value 10 because, just like with our equivalent while loop above:
# the iteration runs;
# then &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; is incremented;
# then &lt;code&gt;i &lt; 10&lt;/code&gt; is checked, and if it's false the loop is exited.
Nonetheless, the loop does run 10 times.

==Exercises==
''under construction''

==Vocabulary==
; while loop: continues looping until its condition is false.
; iteration: one pass through a loop. Also, the action of looping or &quot;iterating&quot;.
; for loop: more suited to counting than a while loop is.

Всего 70 словарных единиц

(+ 97 из 1 и 2 урока = всего 167 единиц)

= Существительные =

Существительные - это слова, которые отвечают на вопрос &quot;что?&quot; (kwo?) или &quot;кто?&quot; (hu?).

Существительные могут быть простыми и производными.

Примеры простых существительных:
* jen (человек)
* kinda (ребенок)
* flor (цветок)
* kitaba (книга)
* dom (дом)
* amiga (друг)
* taim (время)

Важно отметить, что существительное само по себе не несет '''значение количества'''.

Так, слово flor, например, в зависимости от контекста, может обозначать как «цветок», так и «цветы». Для уточнения единственности, перед словом можно поставить слово '''un''' (один):

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|un flor
|один цветок
|
|}

Еще один способ уточнить единственность (одна штука, один кусок): частица (счетное слово) -'''ge''' (ставится после слова):

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|flor-ge
|цветок, одна штука
|
|}


Для уточнения множественности используют либо слова, обозначающее количество (например, '''mucho''' - &quot;много&quot;), либо форму множественного числа (подробнее см. урок 5).

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|mucho flor
|много цветов
|
|}


Идея '''рода''' (точнее, пола) по умолчанию заложена лишь в ряде существительных, обозначающих людей:
* gina (женщина) / man (мужчина)
* gela (девочка) / boy (мальчик)
* mata (мать) / patra (отец)
* docha (дочь) / son (сын)
* sista (сестра) / brata (брат)
* tia (тетя) / onkla (дядя)
* oma (бабушка) / opa (дедушка)
* kindocha (внучка) / kinson (внук)

При необходимости уточнить род в других случаях используют:
* приставки '''gin'''- / '''man'''-

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|gin-leker ''(женщина-врач)''
|man-leker ''(мужчина-врач)''
|-
|gin-kota ''(кошка)''
|man-kota ''(кот)''
|
|}
 
* замену окончания a на -ina / -o

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|amigina ''(подруга)''
|amigo ''(друг)''
|
|}


Падежных форм существительное в лидепла не имеет. Однако различают 2 разных '''падежных значения''' существительного с точки зрения его функции в предложении (те же 2 падежных значения актуальны и для личных местоимений):
* именительное падежное значение (положение перед глаголом)

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|me jan
|я знаю
|-
|amiga samaji
|друг понимает
|
|}
* косвенное падежное значение (положение после глагола или после предлога)

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|yu samaji ''me''
|ты понимаешь ''меня''
|-
|me shwo om ''amiga''
|я говорю о ''друге''
|
|}

При необходимости, для указания падежного значения слова при изменеии порядка слов (например, в целях особого выделения значения слова), можно использовать специальные частицы '''da''' для именительного и '''den''' для косвенного падежного значения:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Me vidi amiga. Den amiga me vidi.
|Я вижу друга. Друга я вижу.
|-
|Om hu yu shwo? - Den amiga om.
|О ком ты говоришь. - О друге.
|-
|Ob lu samaji ela? - Non, samaji da ela (hi) den lu.
|Он понимает ее? - Нет, понимает это она его.
|
|}

Такие частицы делают возможным практически свободный порядок слов в предложении. Заметим однако, что злоупотреблять этими частицами не стоит.


= Отглагольные существительные =

Существительные можно образовывать от глаголов.

Общее существительное, связанное с действием, обозначающее процесс / результат, образуется путем:
* замены конечного &quot;i&quot; на &quot;'''a'''&quot; (если глагол оканчивается на согласный + i):

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|lubi
|luba ''(любовь)''
|
|}

* добавления &quot;'''a'''&quot; (если глагол оканчивается на согласный + i, но является односложным):
{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|pri
|pria ''(приязнь)''
|
|}

* добавления &quot;'''sa'''&quot; (если глагол оканчивается не на i):
{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|gun
|gunsa ''(работа)''
|
|}

{{Лидепла фин-задание}}

Важно отметить, что во всех приведенных случаях существительное связано с глаголом, но несет в себе некоторое дополнительное значение. Можно, однако, также образовать чистое отглагольное существительное, обозначающее именно действие как таковое, с помощью суффикса -'''ing''':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|swimi (плавать)
|swiming (плавание)
|-
|janmi (рождать, рождаться)
|janming (процесс рождения, роды)&lt;br&gt;''(janma - рождение)''
|
|}

= Прилагательные =

Прилагательные отвечают на вопрос &quot;какой?&quot; (kwel?).

Примеры прилагательных:
* hao (хороший)
* buhao (нехороший, плохой)
* gran (большой)
* syao  (маленький)
* jamile (красивый)

''(Напоминание: ''&lt;br&gt;
''в сочетании '''ao''' под ударением a, ''&lt;br&gt;
''буква '''j''' читается как легкий полумягкий слитный «дж»)''

Вместе с прилагательными, для уточнения значения, используются слова:
* muy (очень)
* idyen (немного)
* aika (довольно-таки, весьма)
* basta (достаточно)
* tro (слишком)
* ga (совсем)

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|ga syao
|совсем маленький
|-
|basta gran
|достаточно большой
|-
|muy jamile
|очень красивый
|-
|aika hao
|весьма хороший
|-
|}
 

Прилагательные можно образовывать от глаголов.

Прилагательное со значением &quot;склонный что-либо делать&quot; образуется от глагола путем добавления суффикса '''shil''' ''(положение ударения не меняется)'':

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|samajishil
|понятливый
|-
|dumishil
|задумчивый
|-
|gunshil
|работящий
|
|}


Прилагательные со значением &quot;который можно..&quot; образуются с помощью суффикса '''bile'''
''(слово получает дополнительное ударение на суффиксе)'':
{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|vidibile
|видимый
|-
|audibile
|слышимый

|samajibile

= Глагол bi / es / bin =

В лидепла глаголы не изменяют своей формы - кроме одного-единственного глагола &quot;быть&quot;:
глагол-исключение '''bi''' имеет форму '''es''' в настоящем времени и '''bin''' в прошедшем.

Перед глаголом-связкой bi/es/bin обычно находится существительное, после него - прилагательное.

Глагол bi/es/bin никогда не опускается.
{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Kinda es ga syao.
|Ребенок совсем маленький.
|-
|Ob flor bin muy jamile?
|Цветок был очень красивым?
|-
|Ob kitaba es basta hao?
|Книга достаточно хорошая?
|
|}

В специальных вопросах с глаголом bi (es, bin) возможна и, как правило, происходит инверсия, то есть глагол ставится сразу после вопросительного слова:

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Wo es yu?
|Где ты?
|-
|}

В сложном предложении с вопросительным словом инверсии, как правило, нет:

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Me jan wo yu es.
|Я знаю, где ты.
|-
|}

{{Лидепла фин-задание}}
  

Если подлежащее выражено словом se (&quot;это&quot;) или местоимениями ta или it, его можно опустить, как в вопросе, так и в ответе на него (если значение понятно из контекста):

{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Kwo es se? Kwo es?
|Что это?
|-
|Se es kinda. Es kinda.
|Это ребенок.
|-
|Kwel es ta? Kwel es?
|Какой он?
|-
|Ta es ga syao. Es ga syao.
|Он совсем маленький.
|-
|}

= Прилагательное в функции определения =

Конечно, существительные, как и личные местоимения, могут выполнять роль подлежащего или дополнения при глаголе.
{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Ob kinda jan-te?
|Ребенок знал?
|-
|Me vidi un flor.
|Я вижу (один) цветок.
|-
|}

В такой роли существительные могут сопровождаться прилагательными.

Определение, как правило, находится перед определяемым словом.

{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Syao kinda bu ve samaji yu.
|Маленький ребенок не поймет тебя.
|-
|Me pri jamile flor.
|Мне нравятся красивые цветы (вообще).
|-
|}


Указательные слова:
* '''sey''' (этот)
* '''toy''' (тот)
* '''tal''' (такой)

{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|

= Глаголы наличия ye, yok, hev =

Иногда нужно сказать «есть» не в смысле качества, а в смысле наличия или отсутствия чего-либо.

В этом случае вместо глагола bi используются слова '''ye''' (есть, имеется) и '''yok''' (нету, отсутствует):

{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Ob ye kitaba?
|Книга есть?
|-
|Ya, kitaba ye.
|Да, книга есть.
|-
|Non, kitaba yok.
|Нет, книги нет.
|-
|}


Для того, чтобы сообщить о принадлежности чего-либо кому-либо, используют глагол '''hev''' - иметь.

{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Me hev un jamile flor.

= Притяжательные прилагательные и местоимения =

Для того, чтобы задать вопрос &quot;чей?&quot; и ответить на него, используется определительная частица -'''ney''':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Hu-ney kitaba es?
|Чья это книга?
|-
|Es kinda-ney kitaba.
|Это книга ребенка («ребенкина» книга).
|-
|}

Возможны составные прилагательные:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|sey-kinda-ney kitaba
|книга этого ребенка
|-
|}

То же значение можно выразить с помощью предлога '''de''':
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Es kitaba de sey kinda.
|Это книга этого ребенка.
|-
|}

С  помощью той же частицы -ney можно, в принципе, образовать и притяжательные местоимения: me-ney, yu-ney, ta-ney и т.д. Но притяжательные местоимения употребляются в речи очень часто, поэтому для них существуют также и краткие формы may (мой), yur (твой, ваш), nuy (наш), ley (их), suy (его, ее), luy (его), elay (ее).

{| class=&quot;standard&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 auto; text-align:center; &quot;
!
! | Ед.число
! | Мн.число
|-
! style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot; | 1 лицо

! style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot; | 2 лицо
| colspan=2 | yur
|-
! style=&quot;text-align: right;&quot; | 3 лицо
|  suy &lt;br&gt; luy, elay
| ley
|-
|}

От возвратного местоимения swa можно образовать притяжательное местоимение '''swa-ney''' (свой).

= Частицы gro- и -ki =

В языке лидепла широко используются:
* увеличительная частица-приставка '''gro'''-
* уменьшительно-ласкательный частица-суффикс -'''ki'''

Эти частицы могут использоваться со всеми частями речи:
{| style=&quot;width:70%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|gro-pri
|очень нравиться, очень любить
|-
|gro-jen
|большой человек ''(в разных смыслах)''
|-
|gro-hao
|замечательный
|-
|kinda-ki
|ребеночек
|-
|somni-ki
|дремать, «спатки»
|-
|}

Для образования уменьшительно-ласкательной формы существительного или имени можно заменить конечный гласный на &quot;i&quot;, длинное имя можно сократить до одного слога ''(этот способ применим не всегда)'':

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|doga ''(собака)''
|dogi ''(собачка (ласкаемая))''
|-
|Dimitri
|Dimi
|-
|Konstantin
|Konsti
|-
|}

Также в языке имеются словообразовательные суффиксы -'''kin''' и -'''gron''', служащие для образования существительных с некоторым новым качеством:

{| style=&quot;width:70%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|kitaba ''(книга)''
|kitabagron ''(огромный том, фолиант)''
|-
|dom ''(дом)''
|domkin ''(например, теплица)''
|-
|}

= Испанский и португальский языки =

По количеству носителей испанский язык находится на втором месте после китайского (порядка 400 млн человек).

Испанский язык принадлежит к романской группе языков, а значит, произошел из народной латыни, то есть языка, на котором говорили между собой простые римляне, и который начал распространяться на территории современной Испании в конце III веке до н.э., после того, как Испания вошла в состав Римских владений.

На тот момент на Иберийском (Пиренейском) полуострове проживало большое количество различных племен, самыми многочисленными из которых были иберы и кельты. На средиземноморских землях оставались греческие колонии. И, кроме того, еще в 5 веке на полуострове появились поселения германских племен. Как следствие, огромное количество слов в современном испанском имеют прямую связь с кельтскими, греческими, финикийскими, вестготскимии аналогиями.

С VIII по XV век на территории Пиренейского полуострова имело место арабское господство. Взаимодействие арабской и христианской культуры не было простым и однозначным. Но, как бы то ни было, влияние арабского языка на испанский было огромным и неоспоримым.

В эпоху Средневековья Испания находилась в раздробленном состоянии, и в разных землях говорили на разных наречиях. Но среди всех земель самой могущественной и влиятельной постепенно стала Кастилия, и именно кастильский язык стал основой современного испанского языка. Но все же различия в произношении и лексике в разных провинциях Испании отчетливо заметны и по сей день.

Отрывок из Маленького принца

''(знак ударения ставится перед ударным слогом, ''

''сочетания ue, ua произносятся слитно, ударение на второй звук)'':
{{Лидепла текст}}

&lt;/div&gt;

Португальский язык является языком, близкородственным испанскому, и так же одним из наиболее распространенных на земле языков.

Отрывок из Маленького принца на португальском языке:
{{Лидепла текст}}

&lt;/div&gt;

= Выражение приказы, просьбы, пожелания =

Основная форма, употребленная без подлежащего, выражает повелительное наклонение:

{| style=&quot;width:70%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Jawabi!
|Отвечай(те)!
|-
|}

Для выражения просьбы обычно добавляют '''plis''' (пожалуйста) или '''bi karim''' (будьте добры).
{| style=&quot;width:70%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Helpi (a) me, plis.
|Помоги мне, пожалуйста.
|-
|}
 
''(если при глаголе есть очевидно только одно косвенное дополнение, предлог можно опустить:''
''helpi a me = helpi me)''

Для явного выражения императива (повелительного наклонения) можно добавить частицу '''ba''':

{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=45%|
|width=55%|
|-
|Shwo ba!
|Говори(те)!
|-
|Plis, bu ofni ba sey dwar.
|Пожалуйста, не открывай эту дверь.
|-
|}

Для выражения императива в отрицательной форме также используется частица '''bye''' ''(в этом случае частица ba не нужна)'':

{| style=&quot;width:70%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Bye klosi dwar!
|Не закрывай дверь!
|-
|}

Значение «давайте (сделаем что-то)» так же можно выразить с помощью частицы '''ba''':

{| style=&quot;width:70%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Nu go ba!
|Пойдемте! Давайте пойдем!
|-
|Ta go ba!
|Давайте он пойдет!
|-
|}

Пожелание можно также выразить с помощью следующих частиц (ставятся в начале фразы):
* '''hay''' (пусть)
* '''magari''' (хоть бы)
* '''nomagari''' (только бы не).

{| style=&quot;width:70%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Hay ta lai!
|Пусть он / она придет!
|-
|Magari ela shwo om me!
|Хоть бы она сказала обо мне!
|-
|Nomagari li kwesti om se!
|Только бы они не спросили этого!
|-
|}

После этих частиц может употребляться не только основная форма глагола.

{| style=&quot;width:70%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Magari ta he kwesti om to!
|Хоть бы она уже спросила об этом!
|-
|}
''(желание о том, чтобы действие уже произошло)''

 |-
|Пожалуйста, не бегай: я не могу понять, что ты говоришь мне.
|
|-
|Дай мне, пожалуйста, мой цветок. Он там.
|
|-
|Почитай, пожалуйста, эту книгу для меня: я хочу послушать (услышать), как ты читаешь.
|
|-
|Хоть бы он понял меня!
|
|-
|Только бы не поверил им!
|
|-
|Подожди меня здесь, пожалуйста.
|
|-
|Пусть он скажет ему обо мне.
|
|-
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

= Условие и условность =

При ответе на просьбу иногда бывает нужно слово &quot;бы&quot;: '''wud'''.

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Me wud helpi yu, bat me bu mog: me mus go.
|Я бы помог тебе, но не могу: я должен идти.
|-
|}

А слово «бы» тесно связано со словом «если»: '''si''' .. ('''dan''' - тогда).

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Me wud mog helpi yu si yu wud pregi.
|Я бы мог помочь тебе, если бы ты попросил.
|-
|Si yu wud pregi dan me wud mog helpi.
|Если бы ты попросил, тогда я смог бы помочь.
|-
|}

Слово (союз) «если» можно, конечно, употреблять и без «бы»:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Si yu pregi, (dan) me ve helpi.
|Если ты просишь (попросишь), я помогу тебе.
|-
|}

 |width=50% style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|''русский''
 |width=50% style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|''лидепла''
 |-
|Если ты не веришь мне, я не приду.
|
|-
|Если ты хочешь играть, а не работать, не приходи.
|
|-
|Ты смог бы спать, если бы мы пели и танцевали здесь?
|
|-
|Я бы ответил тебе, но я не понимаю, о чем ты спрашиваешь.
|
|-
|}
&lt;/div&gt;


= Уточнение времени действия =

Когда вы отвечаете на просьбу, что-то объясняете в ответе, иногда бывает необходимо указать особо, что некоторое действие происходит прямо сейчас, совсем скоро будет происходить или, напротив, недавно завершилось.

Для этого в лидепла существуют специальные уточняющие частицы:
* '''zai''' (&quot;прямо сейчас&quot;)
* '''sal''' (&quot;совсем скоро&quot;, &quot;собираюсь&quot;)
* '''he''' (&quot;уже завершено&quot;)
* '''yus he''' (&quot;только что завершено&quot;).

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Me bu mog jawabi nau: me zai chi.
|Я не могу ответить сейчас: я ем.
|-
|Me bu mog lai: nu sal chi deyfan.
|Я не могу прийти: мы сейчас будем обедать ''(&quot;есть обед&quot;)''.
|-
|}


Частицы wud и he могут быть перед глаголом вместе, если речь идет о предположении о прошлом:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Si yu wud he kwesti, me wud he jawabi. Bat yu bu he kwesti e me bu he jawabi.
|Если бы ты спросил, я бы ответила. Но ты не спросил, и я не ответила.
|-
|}

Обратите внимание на то, что некоторые глаголы могут участвовать в построении глагольных последовательностей:

{| style=&quot;width:70%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|go somni
|идти спать
|-
|begin shwo
|начать говорить
|-
|stopi gani
|перестать петь
|-
|}


{{Лидепла задание}}

 {| class=&quot;standard&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0 auto; text-align:left;&quot; width=100%
 |width=50% style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|''русский''
 |width=50% style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;|''лидепла''
 |-
|Я пришел, ем и собираюсь идти спать.
|
|-
|Он только что закончил танцевать.
|
|-
|Он сейчас начнет играть.
|
|-
|Я бы сказал тебе, но ты не пришла.
|
|-
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

Также может статься, что Вам необходимо будет сказать, что действие в принципе имело место быть, когда-то, неважно когда. Или не бывало такого совсем никогда. Для этого существует частица '''gwo''':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Me gwo visiti ela. Me bu yao go adar snova.
|Я бывал у нее. Я не хочу снова туда идти.
|-
|Me bu gwo shwo kun ela.
|Я не говорил с ней (ни разу в жизни).
|-
|}

 |-
|Он говорит, что только пришел и поэтому ''(из-за этого)'' не может прочитать письмо ''(leta)'' сейчас же.
|
|-
|Он не понимал, что она ''(ни разу)'' не видела его, и не придет, если ''(без того что)'' я не поговорю с ней.
|
|-
|Мне пришлось работать сегодня, поэтому я только что пришел домой, ем и разговариваю с детьми о том, что я не знаю, почему в Америке ''(&quot;ik&quot; безударный, ударение на e)'' нет крокодилов ''(krokodil)''.
|
|-
|Я не открою дверь ''(dwar)'' моего дома, кто бы ни пришел и что бы ни говорил.
|
|-
|Я не приду потому ''(из-за того)'', что она не хочет открывать мне ''(для меня)'' дверь.
|
|-
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

= Приставки вида =

Нередко, особенно при рассказывании какой-либо истории, когда имеет значение то, как действия связаны между собой, важно показать, что действие началось, или же что оно было резким, кратким, единичным. Для этого существуют следующие глагольные приставки:
* en- (начало действия)
* ek- (внезапность, однократность)

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=30%|
|width=70%|
|-
|Nu promeni e ta en-gani.
|Мы гуляем (гуляли), и он начинает петь (начал петь, запел).
|-
|Nu audi ke koywan ek-krai.
|Мы слышим (услышали), что кто-то вскрикнул.
|-
|}

С помощью этих приставок можно также образовывать глаголы, соответствующие русским глаголам совершенного вида:
{| style=&quot;width:70%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|jan ''(знать)''
|en-jan ''(узнавать)''
|-
|krai ''(кричать)''
|ek-krai ''(вскрикнуть)''
|-
|}

&lt;/div&gt;

= Частицы переходности / непереходности =

Многие глаголы в лидепла могут употребляться как с дополнением, так и без него:

{| style=&quot;width:70%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Dwar ofni.
|Дверь открывается.
|-
|Me ofni dwar.
|Я открываю дверь.
|-
|}

Однако в некоторых случаях необходимо особо подчеркнуть отсутствие дополнения (непереходность глагола). Это можно сделать с помощью частицы '''fa'''-:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|Ela fa-astoni.
|Она удивляется (удивилась).
|-
|Oni mog audi musika. Musika fa-audi.
|Можно услышать музыку. Музыка слышится, доносится.
|-
|}

С помощью частицы  '''mah'''- можно подчеркнуть переходность или образовать переходный глагол:

{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|astoni ''(удивлять(ся))''
|mah-astoni ''(удивить)''

&lt;/div&gt;

Те же частицы используются и с прилагательными, для того, чтобы сообщить об изменении какого-либо качества:
* '''mah'''- делать или сделать каким-либо
* '''fa'''- становиться или стать каким-либо

''(пишутся перед прилагательным через дефис)''

{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|syao ''(маленький)''
|mah-syao ''(уменьшать)''
|-
|gran ''(большой)''
|fa-gran ''(увеличиваться, расти)''
|-
|}

Нужно заметить, что эти глаголы обозначают в первую очередь ''изменение'' качества. Для сообщения об ''установлении'' нового качества имеется также глагол '''bikam''' - становиться:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Kinda sal bikam aika gao.
|Ребенок скоро станет весьма высоким.
|-
|}

Для образования глаголов (от прилагательных или других глаголов) можно также использовать суффиксы:
* (i)'''fi''' (синоним fa)
* (i)'''si''' (синоним mah):


{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=30%|
|width=30%|
|width=40%|
|-
|klare ''(ясный)''
|klarifi ''(проясниться)''
|klarisi ''(прояснить)''
|-
|}

Частица fa- также может использоваться и с существительными, обозначающими, например, время суток:

{| style=&quot;width:70%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|dey ''(день)''
|fa-dey ''(светает, наступает день)''
|-
|}

= Выражение предположения =

Выразить предположение можно с помощью слов
* '''shayad''' (наверное)
* '''mogbi''' (может быть)
* '''musbi''' (должно быть)

(после этих слов обычно используется основная форма глагола, если предположение относится к будущему):

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Shayad ta bu lai sedey.
|Наверное, он не придет сегодня.
|-
|Mogbi li he lai?
|Может быть, они (уже) пришли?
|-
|}

В таких предложениях могут пригодиться слова '''yo''' (уже) и '''haishi''' (еще, все еще):

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Shayad yur kinda haishi bu janmog shwo.

= Этикет: Спасибо! Извините, что Вы сказали? =

Для того, чтобы выразить благодарность, используется слово '''Danke'''! (спасибо) или выражение '''Danke gro'''! (спасибо большое).

Ответить на благодарность можно с помощью выражения '''Bi hao'''! (Пожалуйста! На здоровье! Не за что!) или '''Es syao dela'''. (Это мелочь. Не стоит благодарности.)

= Язык в фокусе: арабский язык =

Число носителей арабского языка оценивается как порядка 250 млн человек. Однако классический арабский как язык Корана ограниченно используется приверженцами ислама по всему миру, а это уже более полутора миллиардов человек.

Появление в VII веке Корана, записанного на арабском языке, вообще стало определяющим моментом в истории арабского языка. С этого момента окончательно оформилось арабское письмо, и началась стандартизация языка (который существовал преимущественно в виде совокупности родственных диалектов) и развитие его литературной формы.

Лингвисты отмечают, что ранние памятники арабского языка свидетельствуют о значительном количестве заимствований из соседних семитских и арамейских языков, из персидского, греческого, латинского, а позже также из турецкого языков.

Следующим поворотным периодом в развитии арабского языка стал рубеж XVIII-XIX веков, когда активизировались экономические контакты Арабского Востока с Западом. Сегодня в арабский язык активно  проникают международные научно-технические термины и характерные для СМИ обороты, несмотря на деятельность академий арабского языка, прилагающих все усилия для сохранения его в максимально неизмененном виде.

Отрывок из Маленького принца на арабском языке ''(транскрипция отражает звучание лишь приблизительно; по-арабски пишут справа налево)'':

{{Лидепла текст}}

= Точное количество (счет) =

Для счета необходимы числительные:

* nol ''(ноль)''
* '''un''' ''(один)''
* '''dwa''' ''(два)''
* '''tri''' ''(три)''
* '''char''' ''(четыре)''
* '''pet''' ''(пять)''
* '''sit''' ''(шесть)''
* '''sem''' ''(семь)''
* '''ot''' ''(восемь)''
* '''nin''' ''(девять)''
* '''shi''' ''(десять)''

Для образования десятков слово, обозначающее количество десятков, ставится перед словом '''shi''' ''(пишется слитно)'':

* dwashi (двадцать)
* trishi (тридцать)
* ninshi (девяносто)

Для счета от 11 до 19 слово, обозначающее единицы, ставится перед словом shi
''(пишется через дефис)'':

* shi-un (одиннадцать)
* shi-dwa (двенадцать)
* shi-tri (тринадцать)
* shi-nin (девятнадцать).

Аналогично:
* dwashi-un (двадцать один)
* dwashi-dwa (двадцать два)
* dwashi-nin (двадцать девять)

Сто: '''sto'''

Сотни:
* dwasto (двести)
* tristo (триста)
* ninsto (девятьсот).

Если после числительного находится существительное, оно не изменяет своей формы:
{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|dwa jen
|два человека
|-
|pet flor
|пять цветов
|-
|}

= Неточное количество =

Также форма существительного не меняется после слов, обозначающих количество:
* '''mucho''' (много)
* '''shao''' (мало)
* '''pluri''' (несколько)
* '''kelke''' (сколько-то)
* '''idyen''' (немного)

после вопросительного слова '''kwanto''' (сколько)

и также после указательного слова '''tanto''' (столько, настолько):
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Kwanto kinda yu hev?
|Сколько у тебя детей?
|-
|May dwa kinda hev mucho kitaba.
|У моих двоих детей много книг.
|-
|Me hev tanto mani ke me mog kupi un elefanta.
|У меня столько денег, что я могу купить слона.
|-
|}

Однако существует форма также специальная множественного числа существительного. Для ее образования к существительному добавляется s (если слово оканчивается на гласный) или es (если слово оканчивается на согласный):

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|kinda ''(ребенок)''
|kindas ''(дети)''
|-
|flor ''(цветок)''
|flores ''(цветы)''
|-
|}

''(Замечание: при образовании формы множественного числа место ударения не меняется.)''

Форма множественного числа используется тогда, когда почему-либо необходимо указать на множественность при отсутствии слов, указывающих на количество:
{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|May kindas bu pri lekti.
|Мои дети не любят читать.

= Время по часам =

Числительные важны в разговоре о времени.

Для того, чтобы сообщить о точном времени, используется слово '''klok''':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|klok pet
|пять часов
|-
|klok dwa e dwashi-pet
|два (часа) двадцать пять (минут)
|-
|klok pet e haf
|пять (часов) и половина = пол-шестого
|-
|klok ot e charfen
|восемь (часов) и четверть = четверть девятого
|-
|klok tri sin shi
|три (часа) без десяти (минут) = без десяти три
|-
|}

Спросить «Который час?» можно с помощью вопросительного слова '''kwel''' (какой, который):

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Kwel klok es? - Es klok shi-dwa sin shi-pet.
|Который час? - Без пятнадцати двенадцать.
|-
|}

Приблизительность выражается с помощью слова предлога-наречия '''bli''' (около):

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Es bli klok shi.
|Сейчас около десяти (часов).
|-
|}

Чтобы сообщить о том, что что-то происходит в определенное время, используется предлог общего значения '''pa''':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Me (ve) lai pa klok sit.
|Я приду в шесть.
|-
|}

''(здесь частицу будущего времени можно опустить)''

К указанию времени можно добавить сочетания pa aksham ''(вечера)'', pa sabah ''(утра)'':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Me (ve) telefoni pa klok sem pa aksham.
|Я позвоню в семь вечера.
|-
|}

|
|-

&lt;/div&gt;

= Дни недели, месяца, даты, времена года =

Дни недели ('''wik''' – неделя) образуются из числительных с помощью прибавления частицы '''di''' (пишутся слитно). Альтернативные называния основаны на названиях планет ''(ударение везде на первый слог)'':
* undi = lunadi (понедельник)
* dwadi = marsadi (вторник)
* tridi = merkudi (среда),
* chardi = jipidi (четверг)
* petdi  = venudi (пятница),
* sitdi  = satudi (суббота)
* semdi  = suryadi (воскресенье)

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Kwel dey de wik es sedey?
| Какой сегодня день недели?
|-
|Sedey es chardi.
|Сегодня четверг.
|-
|}


Аналогично, с помощью слова '''mes''' (месяц), образуются названия месяцев ''(пишутся через дефис)''. Альтернативные названия основаны на распространенных европейских:
* januar = mes-un (январь)
* februar = mes-dwa (февраль)
* marto = mes-tri (март)
* april = mes-char (апрель)
* mey = mes-pet (май)
* yuni = mes-sit (июнь)
* yuli = mes-sem (июль)
* augusto = mes-ot (август)
* septemba = mes-nin (сентябрь)
* oktoba = mes-shi (октябрь)
* novemba = mes-shi-un (ноябрь)
* desemba = mes-shi-dwa (декабрь)

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Kwel datum es sedey?
|Какая сегодня дата?
|-
|Sedey es dey trishi-un de mes-shi-dwa.
|Сегодня тридцать первое декабря.
|-
|Sedey es dey nin mes-pet yar mil ninsto-charshi-pet.
|Сегодня девятое мая 1945 года.
|-
|}

Времена года ('''seson'''):
* saif (лето)
* oton (осень)
* hima (зима)
* vesna (весна).

Со всеми словами, обозначающими дни недели, месяца, времена года, время суток обычно используется предлог общего значения pa:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|pa undi
|в понедельник
|-
|pa mes-tri
|в марте

= Язык в фокусе: хинди =

Язык хинди находится на 5 месте по количеству носителей, однако по общему числу говорящих он однозначно уступает лишь китайскому.

Само слово &quot;хинди&quot; может быть понято по-разному: в узком смысле оно обозначает стандартный литературный язык, в широком - целую группу близко-родственных диалектов.

История хинди уходит в глубь веков, в Центральную Азию, где говорили на языке, который стал прародителем множества индоевропейских языков. Самое большое влияние на хинди оказали санскрит (древний литературный язык Индии, являвшийся языком межкультурного общения) и английский (к середине XIX века Индия стала колонией Британии).

Отрывок из Маленького принца на хинди ''(транскрипция передает звучание весьма приближенно, удвоение гласного обозначает его долготу)'':

= Наречия =

Наречия - это слова, которые характеризуют действие.
В предложении наречия относятся к глаголам (тогда как прилагательные описывают существительные).

Наречия часто образуются от прилагательных (оканчивающихся на e) с помощью добавления '''m''':
{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|lente ''(медленный)''
|lentem ''(медленно)''
|-
|jamile ''(красивый)''
|jamilem ''(красиво)''
|-
|}
''(Замечание: при образовании наречия от прилагательного место ударения не меняется.)''

Прилагательные, оканчивающиеся на o и y, совпадают по форме с наречиями:
{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|hao
|хороший, хорошо
|-
|kway
|быстрый, быстро
|-
|}

От существительного можно образовывать как прилагательные с помощью частицы -ney, так и наречия с помощью частицы -'''nem''':
{| style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
|-
|width=20%|
|width=45%|
|width=30%|
|-
|amiga ''(друг)''
|amiga-ney ''(принадлежащий другу, дружеский)''
|amiga-nem ''(по-дружески)''
|-
|}

Таким же образом от числительных (количественных) можно образовывать порядковые числительные и соответствующие им наречия:
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|un-ney ''(первый)''
|un-nem ''(во-первых)''
|-
|dwa-ney ''(второй)''
|dwa-nem ''(во-вторых)''
|-
|}

Вопросительное слово: '''komo''' (как), указательное: '''tak''' (так).

Предлог '''bay''' вводит средство, инструмент:
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Komo yu safari? - Me safari bay auto.
|Как ты путешествуешь? - Я путешествую на машине.
|-
|Me bu yao jivi tak.
|Я не хочу жить так.
|-
|}

|Эта машина медленная ''(lente)''. Она двигается медленно.
|
|-
|Этот поезд ''(tren)'' быстрый. Мы едем на нем ''(сейчас)'' очень быстро.
|
|-
|Это добрый ''(karim)'' человек. Он смотрит на меня по-доброму, по-дружески.
|
|-
|Не смотри на меня так. - Как?
|
|-
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

С глаголами-связками bi / es / bin, sta, bikam используются, как правило, прилагательные (даже если в русском предложении наречие):
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Ta es alegre.
|Он веселый.
|-
|Es alegre hir.
|Здесь весело.
|-
|}

Наречия частоты:
* sempre (всегда)
* oftem (часто)
* rarem (редко)
* pinchanem (обычно)
* neva (никогда)

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Me sempre majbur weiti yu!
|Мне всегда приходится ждать тебя!
|-
|Nu oftem miti.
|Мы часто встречаемся.
|-
|Li rarem vidi miti.
|Они редко видят друг друга.
|-
|Pinchanem me lai a dom pa klok sit.
|Обычно я прихожу домой в 6 часов.
|-
|Ta bu danki neva.
|Он никогда не благодарит.
|-
|}

''(двойное отрицание не меняет смысла фразы)''

Разные наречия:
* sertem (конечно)
* semblem (по-видимому, кажется)
* gro (очень, сильно)
* for (дальше)
* wek (прочь)
* sun (скоро)

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Sertem me lai.
|Конечно я приду.
|-
|Semblem ta bu yao gun for.
|Кажется, он/она больше не хочет работать.
|-
|Me lubi gro.
|Я очень сильно люблю.
|-
|Go ba wek!
|Уходи прочь!
|-
|}

= Сравнения =

Для сравнений с прилагательными и наречиями используются слова:
* '''pyu''' (более)
* '''meno''' (менее)
* '''zuy''' (наиболее)
* '''minim''' (наименее)
''(напоминание: в слове minim ударение на первом слоге, это исключение)''

* '''kem''' (чем):
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|Yu es pyu jamile kem ela.
|Ты красивее, чем она.
|-
|Auto muvi pyu lentem kem avion.
|Машина едет (двигается) медленнее чем самолет.
|-
|Yu es zuy jamile pa munda.
|Ты самая красивая в мире.
|-
|Me es zuy gao fon may amigas.
|Я — самый высокий из моих друзей.
|-
|May avion flai zuy kway.
|Мой самолет летает быстрее всех (наиболее быстро).
|-
|}

Слова pyu, meno, zuy и minim могут использоваться и сами по себе со значениями, соответственно, &quot;больше&quot;, &quot;меньше&quot;, &quot;больше всего&quot;, меньше всего&quot;:
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|Me lubi mata zuy.
|Больше всего я люблю маму.
|-
|Me bu samaji pyu.
|Я больше не понимаю.
|-
|}

* zuy mucho = '''maiste''' (большинство):
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|Maiste kinda in may klas pri lekti.
|Большинство детей в моем классе любят читать.
|-
|}

Для сообщения о сравнимости, равенстве, используют слова '''sam''' (так же, столь же) и '''kom''' (как):
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Yu es sam gao kom me.
|Ты такой же высокий, как и я. &lt;br&gt;''(Одного со мной роста.)''
|-
|}

Оборот &quot;чем.. тем&quot; - '''kem .. tem''':
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Kem pyu kway, tem pyu hao.
|Чем быстрее, тем лучше.
|-
|}

&lt;/div&gt;

= Прилагательные и глаголы в функции существительного =

При сравнении иногда приходится повторять одно и то же существительное. &lt;br&gt;
Для того, чтобы это избежать, используются заменители существительного - частицы '''la''' и '''las''':
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|Sey flor es pyu jamile kem toy-la.
|Это цветок красивее, чем тот.
|-
|Sey kindas es pyu syao kem toy-las.
|Эти дети меньше, чем те.
|-
|}

''Иногда в качестве существительного используются формы типа otres (&quot;другие&quot;) (это форма, образованная от прилагательного по закону образования множественного числа существительного). Но такие формы являются скорее сокращениями от грамматически правильного otre-las.''


Если речь идет о человеке, можно использовать слово '''wan''':
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|Tri jen lai. Un-ney wan begin shwo.
|Приходят (пришли) три человека. Первый начинает говорить.
|-
|}


Также иногда нужно сообщить о некотором понятии, о чем-то абстрактном.&lt;br&gt;
В такой ситуации используется частица '''lo''':
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|Lo zuy jamile es luba.
|Самое красивое — это любовь.
|-
|}

Вместо существительного в таком предложении можно употребить глагол. Для того, чтобы показать, что глагол используется практически в значении существительного, перед ним ставят частицу '''tu''':
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|Lo zuy muhim es tu remembi om to.
|Самое главное — помнить об этом.
|-
|}

Глагол с частицей tu можно использовать также в качестве подлежащего с глаголом bi / es / bin:
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|Tu fogeti om to bu es fasile.
|Забыть об этом непросто.
|-
|}

= Существительные деятеля и объекта действия =

Существительные, обозначающие деятеля или инструмент, производящий то или иное действие, образуются при помощи суффикса ''er'' (конкретное значение определяется по контексту)&lt;br&gt;
''(напоминание: суффикс er всегда безударный)'':
{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|talimi ''(учить, преподавать)
|talimer ''(учитель)''
|-
|ofni ''(открывать)''
|ofner ''(открывашка)''
|-
|}

Для уточнения значения инструмента можно использовать суффикс '''tul''':
{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|vinti ''(винтить)''
|vintitul ''(отвёртка)''
|-
|}

Названия многих профессий образуются с помощью суффикса er (хотя и не всегда от глаголов):
* leker (от leki)''(врач)''
* talimer (от talimi)''(учитель)''
* suter (от suti)''(портной)''
* kuker (от kuki)''(повар)''
* shofer ''(шофер)''.

Нужно, однако, признать, что названия некоторых широко распространенных профессий образуются с помощью суффикса -'''ista''' — как и названия приверженцев того или иного учения (-изма)&lt;br&gt;
''(в обоих случаях эти слова образуются от существительных)'':
* jurnalista ''(журналист)''
* ateista ''(атеист)''

В некоторых (редких) случаях возможно двойное образование, например профессия программист:&lt;br&gt;
programer ''(от глагола programi)'' или programista ''(от существительного programa)''.


Мы поговорили о том, кто совершает действие. Поговорим теперь о том, над чем совершается действие.&lt;br&gt;
Самый общий способ образования существительного, обозначающего объект действия, или нечто, связанное с действием — суффикс -'''ka''' (можно рассматривать его как сокращение от слова kosa — вещь, с помощью этого суффикса можно образовывать существительные не только от глаголов):
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=30%|
|width=70%|
|-
|plei ''(играть)''
|pleika ''(игрушка)''
|-
|trani ''(волочить)''
|tranika ''(шлейф — то, что волочится)''
|-
|jivi ''(жить)''
|jivika ''(живое существо)''
|-
|}


Для уточнения именно объекта действия можно использовать суффикс -'''wat''':
{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|pi ''(пить)''
|piwat ''(напиток)''
|-
|sendi ''(посылать)''
|sendiwat ''(посылка)''
|-
|}

Для обозначения конкретного результата действия имеется суффикс -'''tura''':
{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|skribi ''(писать)''
|skribitura ''(надпись)''
|-
|shwo ''(говорить)''
|shwotura ''(изречение)''
|-
|}

&lt;/div&gt;

= Существительные, связанные с качеством =

Для образования существительного от прилагательного используется в первую очередь суффикс -'''taa'''&lt;br&gt;
''(конечное e перед ним заменяется на i)'':
{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|hao ''(хороший)''
|haotaa ''(добро)''
|-
|vere ''(настоящий)''
|veritaa ''(истина)''
|-
|}

Существительные с этим суффиксом приобретают некоторое собственное, дополнительное значение. &lt;br&gt;
Существительное же, обозначающее чистое качество, можно образовать при помощи суффикса -'''nesa'''&lt;br&gt;
''(в прилагательных на -ney происходит замена -ney на -nesa)'':
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:5%;;&quot;
|-
|width=20%|
|width=30%|
|width=30%|
|-
|reale ''(реальный)''
|realitaa ''(реальность как новое понятие)''
|realenesa ''(реальность как свойство)''
|-
|gao ''(высокий)''
|gaotaa ''(высота)''
|gaonesa ''(высокость)''
|-
|}


С помощью замены конечного e на a в некоторых случаях можно получить существительное со значением &quot;кто-либо или что-либо, характеризуемое данным качеством&quot;:
{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|adulte ''(взрослый)''
|adulta ''(взрослый человек)''
|-
|konstante ''(постоянный)''
|konstanta ''(константа)''
|-
|}


Уже знакомый суффикс -ka образует существительное со значением &quot;нечто/некий предмет, связанный с качеством/обладающий качеством&quot;:
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|mole ''(мягкий)''
|molika ''(мякоть)''
|-
|syao ''(маленький)''
|syaoka ''(мелочь)''

|}

= Способы выражения определения =

Чаще всего определение к существительному выражено прилагательным. Но это не единственная возможность.&lt;br&gt;
Для того, чтобы сделать определение из существительного, к нему обычно присоединяют частицу -'''ney''', но таким образом получаются по большей части определения, отвечающие на вопрос «чей» или &quot;относящийся к&quot;:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=30%|
|width=70%|
|-
|kinda-ney kitaba
|книга ребенка
|-
|interes-ney kitaba
|интересная книга
|-
|}

Для того, чтобы задать более общее отношение, существительные можно просто поставить друг за другом (и, при необходимости, для особой ясности, связать с помощью дефиса):

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=30%|
|width=70%|
|-
|gina dey
|женский день ''(то есть праздник 8 марта)''
|-
|akwa-sporta
|водный спорт (водные виды спорта)
|-
|}

Если в результате сложения двух понятий получается нечто новое, некое новое понятие, для которого нужно новое слово, составляющие пишутся слитно:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=30%|
|width=70%|
|-
|kindakitaba
|книга для детей, детская книга ''(особый тип книги)''
|-
|}

Есть ряд слов, которые регулярно участвуют в образовании таких новых слов, например:
* jen ''(человек)''
* yuan ''(служащий, работник)''
* guan ''(учреждение)''

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:5%;;&quot;
|-
|width=20%|
|width=30%|
|width=50%|
|-
|mar &lt;br&gt;''(море)''
|marjen &lt;br&gt;''(моряк; человек, связанный с морем)''
|maryuan &lt;br&gt;''(моряк, матрос; человек, работающий в море)''
|-
|kitaba ''(книга)''
|kitabaguan ''(библиотека)''
|
|-
|}


Кроме того, определение может быть выражено придаточным предложением.&lt;br&gt;
Если придаточное предложение находится перед определяемым словом, то оно (предложение) выделяется с помощью особого оборота '''ti .. na''':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:5%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Ti yu vidi na kinda janmog dansi hao.
|Ребенок, которого ты видишь, умеет хорошо танцевать.
|-
|Yu vidi ti janmog dansi hao na kinda.
|Ты видишь ребенка, который умеет хорошо танцевать.
|-
|}

Если придаточное предложение находится после определяемого слова (как в русском), оно вводится при помощи слова ''ke'' – при условии, что определяемое слово не являются частью этого придаточного предложения. Если после оборота предложение продолжается, лучше либо отделить оборот с помощью частицы na, либо оформить слово с определением как тему предложения:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:5%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Kinda ke yu vidi na janmog dansi hao.
|rowspan=2|Ребенок, которого ты видишь, умеет хорошо танцевать.
|-
|Kinda ke yu vidi, ta janmog dansi hao.
|-
|}


Оборот '''to ke''':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Me bu pri to ke yu shwo.
|Мне не нравится то, что ты говоришь.
|-
|Me jan ke yu he zwo mucho. &lt;br&gt;Bat me bu yao shwo om to ke yu he zwo.
|Я знаю, что ты сделал много. &lt;br&gt;Но я не хочу говорить о том, что ты сделал.
|-
|}

Если же определяемое слово является подлежащим придаточного предложения, используется слово '''kel''':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Yu vidi kinda kel janmog dansi hao.
|Ты видишь ребенка, который умеет хорошо танцевать.
|-
|}

Также kel используется с предлогами:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Es kinda om kel me he shwo a yu.
|Это ребенок, о котором я тебе говорил.
|-
|Es jen fo kel me jivi.
|Это человек, для которого я живу.
|-
|}

= Этикет: беседа о погоде =

Как известно, самая подходящая тема для светской беседы - это погода ('''meteo''').&lt;br&gt;
Русское выражение &quot;на улице&quot; (если беседа ведется в помещении) передается с помощью наречия '''ausen''' (снаружи).&lt;br&gt;
О температуре можно сказать с помощью прилагательных:
* lenge ''(холодный)''
* warme ''(теплый)''
* garme ''(горячий, жаркий).''
{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Es aika lenge ausen.
|На улице довольно холодно.
|-
|}

В ситуации светской беседы прямой вопрос с ob не очень к месту. Можно задать вопрос иначе, с помощью слова '''ver''' (от vere - настоящий) и получить ответ:
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|Es aika lenge ausen, bu ver? &lt;br&gt;Ver, muy. / Non, bu es ver. Es ya warme.
|На улице довольно холодно, не правда ли?&lt;br&gt; Да, правда, очень (холодно). / Нет, неправда. Ведь тепло.
|-
|}

Если же нужно сообщить о каких-либо изменениях, можно использовать выражение с '''fa''':
{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Zai fa-lenge.
|Холодает.
|-
|}

Для осадков существуют особые глаголы '''pluvi''' (о дожде) и '''snegi''' (о снеге), а также '''fengi''' (о ветре):
{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Zai pluvi gro.
|Идет сильный дождь.
|-
|Sembli ke sal snegi.
|Кажется, скоро будет дождь.
|-
|Sedey fengi idyen.
|Сегодня дует немного.
|-
|}

О том же можно сказать и с помощью существительных pluva, snega, feng и глаголов '''ye''' и '''yok''':
{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Sedey feng yok.
|Сегодня нет ветра.
|-
|}

Слова, необходимые для описания состояния неба:
* skay ''(небо)''
* klare ''(ясный)''
* tume ''(темный)''
* surya ''(солнце)''
* badal ''(облако, туча)'':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|Skay es klare, badal yok.
|Небо ясное, облаков нет.
|-
|Ye mucho tume badal. Shayad sal pluvi.
|Много темных туч. Наверное скоро пойдет дождь.
|-
|}

В каком-нибудь походе также не будут лишними выражения fa-dey, fa-nocha:
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|Fa-dey.
|Светает. Начинается день.
|-
|}

Наконец, можно просто заметить:
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|Meteo es hao, bu ver?
|Погода хорошая, не правда ли?
|-
|}

И услышать в ответ:
{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|Ver, yu es prave, meteo es ya ga hao.
|Да, Вы правы, в самом деле погода исключительно хороша.

= Язык в фокусе: русский =

Русский язык является родным для порядка 150 млн человек. Однако по распространенности в интернете русский язык уступает лишь английскому.

Специалисты делят историю русского языка на несколько периодов. Праславянский язык выделился из праиндоевропейского языка примерно в I веке н.э. Праславянский язык к V веку распался на несколько ветвей, в частности на древнерусский и старославянский. Народ говорил на древнерусском языке, но при этом в церкви, в книгах и документах использовался старославянский, и потому влияние старославянского языка на русский было довольно велико. Так, и в современном русском можно найти такие пары слов как «голова» (из древнерусского) и «глава» (из старославянского), где одно слово описывает явление обычные, другое же относится к сфере книжного языка.

Татаро-монгольское иго и влияние татарских ханств привело к заимствованию некоторого количества тюркских слов.
К XVIII-XIX векам старославянский язык был вытеснен из официального употребления, однако в то же время в русскую речь начали обильно проникать заимствования и кальки (то есть слова, построенные на манер иностранных) из западноевропейских языков - например, из французского, на котором общались между собой молодые дворяне, и из немецкого, который являлся в о время языком науки.

Русский литературный язык окончательно сложился в начале XIX столетия.

В XX веке на язык значительно повлиял приход большевиков (появилось много новых слов, была произведена реформа орфографии). Также нельзя не отметить современное влияние на русский язык англоязычной по происхождению культуры.

= Система составных местоимений и наречий =

В языке лидепла есть система составных местоимений (то есть слов, которые могут употребляться вместо других частей речи).

Левая часть местоимения:
* '''koy''' (какой-то, какой-нибудь)
* '''kada''' (каждый)
* '''eni''' (любой)
* '''otre''' (другой)
* '''nul''' (никакой)
* '''ol''' (весь)

Все эти слова сами по себе могут использоваться как прилагательные.


Правая часть местоимения:
* '''wan''' (о людях)

Предлог, как правило, находится перед словом, к которому он относится:
Bli dom ye garden. - Рядом с домом есть сад.
Однако порядок слов можно поменять, если перед словом, к которому относится предлог, поставить частицу den:

= Язык в фокусе: японский =

Японский язык является родным для 125 млн. человек.

Ученые спорят о происхождении японского языка. Точно известно лишь, что приблизительно в VI веке до нашей эры Япония вступила в дипломатические отношения с Китаем и Кореей, благодаря чему в жизнь японцев проникли элементы культуры этих стран. В это же время в Японии появились первые письменные произведения, состоящие по большей части из китайских иероглифов.

В XVI португальцы завезли в Японию достижения технологического прогресса и европейскую религию, и, как следствие, японский язык значительно обогатился заимствованиями из португальского.
В начале XVII века японский правитель наложил запрет на исповедование христианства и объявил Японию закрытой страной. С тех пор значительных вмешательств в развитие японского языка извне зафиксировано не было.

''Если вы дочитали до этого урока, значит вы уже освоили основную часть грамматики языка, и можете начинать читать тексты (со словарем или обращаясь к соответствующему русскому тексту), например [http://wiki.lidepla.info/index.php/Fabula сказки], в частности [http://wiki.lidepla.info/index.php/Fabula#Fabula_aus_.22Fabulas_via_telefon.22 &quot;Сказки по телефону&quot; ] Джанни Родари. Вот, например, сказка [http://wiki.lidepla.info/index.php/Alisa_to_lwonik &quot;Алиса Валяшка&quot;] с параллельным текстом на русском и на итальянском языках.

Прочитанный и понятый небольшой забавный текст радует и вдохновляет. Однако нужно заметить, что, в целях привыкания к языку и освоения лексики, специалисты советуют читать длинные произведения. Если вы решите последовать этому совету, рекомендуем вам перевод увлекательной книги Н.Чуковского [http://wiki.lidepla.info/index.php/Marjen_Raterford_she_maoris &quot;Матрос Рутерфорд в плену у новозеландцев&quot;]. Если вам всё же ближе сказки, вас ждет знаменитый &quot;[http://wiki.lidepla.info/index.php/Syao_Prinsa Маленький принц]&quot; и не менее знаменитая &quot;[http://wiki.lidepla.info/index.php/Alisa_in_Divalanda Алиса в стране чудес]&quot; (хотя с Алисой сложнее, так как фрагменты с игрой слов переводятся, очевидно, не дословно).

Ну и наконец, вы всегда можете начать непосредственно общаться на лидепла в [https://www.facebook.com/groups/lidepla/ группе на фейсбук] или на [http://lidepla.org/forum/1 форуме на сайте &quot;Лидепландия&quot;].

Желаем у успехов и надеемся на встречу!''


= Особые глаголы =

Глаголы '''pai''' (получать), '''dai''' (дать) и '''lwo in''' (падать в) в сочетании с другими глаголами приобретают новый оттенок значения:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=30%|
|width=70%|
|-
|Me pai ofni boxa.
|Мне удалось открыть коробку. ''(достижение результата)''
|-
|Ta dai kwiti molya.
|Он взял да и бросил жену. ''(неожиданность)''
|-
|Ela lwo in plaki.
|Она разрыдалась. ''(глубина перехода в новое состояние)''
|-
|}

В лидепла есть особый глагол, который не имеет собственного значения: '''fai'''. Его можно использовать с существительным, тогда он приобретает значение «делать обычное действие с этим предметом»:

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|fai kitaba
|читать книгу
|-
|fai kama
|спать, лежать в кровати
|-
|}

В целом, глагол fai можно использовать вместо практически любого глагола (преимущественно в разговорной речи, конечно).


Глагол '''geti''' обозначает «деться», «попасть в какую-то ситуацию»:

{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|geti inu mushkile situasion
|попасть в сложную ситуацию
|-
|}


Иногда глагол повторяют (через дефис). Такое повторение придает значение действия небольшой продолжительности и интенсивности, возможно повторяющегося:

{| style=&quot;width:80%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Me yao shwo-swho kun yu.
|Я хочу перекинуться с тобой парой слов.
|-
|Ta go-go bli elay dom.
|Он похаживал у ее дома.
|-
|}

Повторение глагола через отрицательную частицу bu – (разговорный) способ задать вопрос:

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Yu lai-bu-lai?
|Ты придешь или нет?
|-
|}


= Пассив =

Для того, чтобы сообщить, что действие совершается над чем-либо / кем-либо, используется частица '''gei''':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=30%|
|width=70%|
|-
|Boxa gei ofni.
|Коробка открывается. Коробку открывают.
|-
|}

Чтобы добавить того, кто совершает действие, используется предлог '''bay''':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|Sey leta gei skribi bay may mata.
|Это письмо пишет моя мать.
|-
|}


Иногда важно сказать, что кто-то совершает действие самостоятельно, без чьей-либо помощи. Или что действие совершает именно тот человек, о котором говорят, он самый. Для этого существует слово '''selfa''' (сам):

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=40%|
|width=60%|
|-
|Mata selfa he skribi se.
|Сама мать написала это.
|-
|Sey shapa gwo gei porti bay rega selfa.
|Эту шляпу носил сам король.
|-
|Kinda he skribi se olo pa selfa.
|Ребенок написал всё это сам (без чьей-либо помощи).
|-
|}

Если действие уже совершилось и мы говорим о результате, можно использовать знакомую частицу -'''ney''' и глагол bi/es/bin:

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Dwar es ofni-ney.
|Дверь открыта.
|-
|}

Нередко нужно сообщить материал, из которого что-либо сделано. Для передачи этого значения используется уже знакомый предлог '''aus''':

{| style=&quot;width:60%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=50%|
|width=50%|
|-
|Se es zwo-ney aus glas.
|Это сделано из стекла.
|-
|}

|В детстве ''(kinda-yash)'' мне никогда не удавалось построить ''(bildi)'' зАмок ''(kastela)'' из песка ''(ramla)'', потому что обычно приходил мой брат ''(brata)'' и ломал ''(rupti)'' его.
|
|-
|На самом деле ''(pa fakta)'' он не хотел ломать, просто ''(simplem = sim)'' он был маленький и не понимал, что я делаю.
|
|-
|И замок много раз строился моими руками ''(handas)'' и ломался ножкой ''(peda-ki)'' брата.
|
|-
|Когда братишка видел, что замок сломан, он часто начинал сильно плакать, ведь он хотел лишь ''(просто)'' поиграть со мной.
|
|-
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

= Комбинация действий =

Сообщить о том, что два действия протекали одновременно, можно с помощью предлога '''al''', вводящего обстоятельства:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=30%|
|width=70%|
|-
|Me lekti al chi.
|Я ем и читаю. Я читаю пока ем. Я читаю во время еды.
|-
|}

Того же эффекта можно достичь, образовав от одного из глаголов деепричастие с помощью частицы -'''yen''':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=30%|
|width=70%|
|-
|Me chi lekti-yen.
|Я ем, читая.
|-
|}


Если одно действие становится некоторым фоном, так что приближается к качеству, можно образовать причастие с помощью частицы -'''she''':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=30%|
|width=70%|
|-
|Lubi-she jen yao sempre bi bli mutu.
|Любящие люди всегда хотят быть рядом друг с другом.
|-
|}

Или наречие, при помощи частицы -'''shem''':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=30%|
|width=70%|
|-
|Ta go ahfi-shem.
|Он идет, украдкой ''(«прячущимся образом»)''.
|-
|}

Также возможно образование существительного с помощью частицы -'''sha''':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=30%|
|width=70%|
|-
|Gani-sha es may sista.
|Человек, который поет, - моя сестра.
|-
|}


Если же одно действие произошло после другого, используют предлог '''afte''' (после):

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=30%|
|width=70%|
|-
|Afti chi me sempre promeni idyen.
|После того, как я поем, я всегда немного гуляю. После еды я всегда прогуливаюсь.
|-
|}

Или наречие, образованное с помощью частицы -'''nem''':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=30%|
|width=70%|
|-
|Ta kan-te ofensi-nem.
|Она смотрела обиженно ''(«обиженным образом»)''.
|-

= Язык в фокусе: немецкий =

Немецкий язык является родным для порядка 90 млн человек.

Язык относится к германской вести индоевропейской семьи. Немецкий язык как язык единого германского народа начал складываться в начале XI столетия, вместе с объединением многоплеменной германской общности - хотя необходимо признать, что на территории Германии и сегодня говорят на многих диалектах, причем носители некоторых из них порой с трудом понимают друг друга.

Позже, одновременно с развитием экономики, происходило проникновение в немецкую речь иностранных, в частности французских и славянских, слов. В XX веке в достаточно большом количестве появились и английские заимствования.

Отрывок из Маленького принца на немецком:
{{Лидепла текст}}
{|
|Ach, kleiner Prinz, so nach und nach habe ich dein kleines schwermütiges Leben verstanden.
|ah 'klyainea prints s/zo nah unt nah 'habe ih dain 'klyaines shwea'mi/utiges leebn feash'tandn

|Lange Zeit hast du, um dich zu zerstreuen, nichts anderes gehabt als die Lieblichkeit der Sonnenuntergänge.

|-
|Das erfuhr ich am Morgen des vierten Tages, als du mir sagtest:

|-
|Ich liebe die Sonnenuntergänge sehr.

|-
|}
&lt;/div&gt;

Возможности словообразования лидепла - это аффиксы (различные приставки и суффиксы, которые пишутся слитно), частицы (пишутся через дефис) и словосложение.

Как правило, слова и суффиксы складываются непосредственно в своей основной форме, однако в некоторых случаях регулярный последний гласный (то есть -a у существительных, -e у прилагательных и -i у глаголов) могут отбрасываться.

= Аффиксы =

Аффиксы, помимо того, что делятся на приставки и суффиксы (приставки прибавляются в начале слова, суффиксы - в конце), бывают изменяющие и не изменяющие класс исходного слова. В этом уроке приводится полная система аффиксов лидепла. Самые частотупотребляемые из них уже встречались в предыдущих

= Частицы =

Частицы пишутся со словами через дефис. Различают общие частицы, которые можно использовать со словами, принадлежащими разным классам, и специальные, используемые со словами только одного какого-то класса.

== Общие ==

* Увеличительная частица-префикс '''gro'''- и уменьшительная частица-постфикс -'''ki''' (используются со всеми частями речи)

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=10%|
|width=70%|
|-
|gro-okos
|глазищи
|-
|gro-gran
|огромный
|-
|gro-jamilem
|прекрасно
|-
|gro-chi
|много есть, обжираться
|-
|}

Заметим, что в лидепла есть также и наречие gro, поэтому можно сказать, например, Zai gro-pluvi. или Zai pluvi gro.

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=10%|
|width=70%|
|-
|gela-ki
|маленькая девочка, девчушка
|Zai pluvi-ki.
|Идёт слабый дождик.
|-
|}

С именами собственными обозначает ласкательную форму: Lena-ki - Леночка

* Для выражения подобия (&quot;навроде, типа, некое подобие&quot;) используется частица-постфикс -'''si''':


{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=10%|
|width=70%|
|-
|Ela es may mata-si.
|Она для меня как мать. Она моя вторая мама.
|-
|rude-si
|красноватый
|-
|Ta studi-si.
|Он/Она как будто учится. (&quot;Типа учится.&quot;)
|-
|}

* Для выражения частичности можно использовать слово '''haf''' (половина), которое может функционировать как частица:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=10%|
|width=70%|
|-
|haf-nadi
|отчасти надеяться
|-
|}

Заметим, что с существительными слово haf обозначает именно &quot;половина&quot;: haf-dey - полдня.

''Частицы gro-, -ki, -si, haf- не меняют класс (функцию) слова.''



* Частица '''fa'''- обозначает непроизвольный (то есть происходящий независимо от желания объекта) переход в некоторое новое состояние. Образованное таким образом слово состояния может принимать некоторые глагольные частицы:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=30%|
|width=70%|
|-
|Zai fa-dey.
|Светает.
|-
|Ela gwo fa-rude kada ves al shwo om lu.
|Она краснела каждый раз, когда говорила о нем.
|-
|fa-astoni
|удивиться
|-
|}

* Частица '''mah'''- означает произвольный (то есть требующий приложения сознательных усилий) переход чего-либо (объекта действия) в некоторое состояние. Образованный таким образом глагол может принимать глагольные частицы:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=20%|
|width=70%|
|-
|Me he mah-warme akwa.
|Я подогрел воду.
|-
|mah-chi
|кормить
|-
|}

Заметим, что mah может выступать самостоятельно как каузативный глагол.

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=10%|
|width=70%|
|-
|Mah akwa warme.
|Подогреть воду.
|-
|Mah swa tayar. &lt;br&gt;(=Tayari swa.)
|Подготовиться.
|-
|}


* Определительная частица -'''ney''' используется очень широко для образования прилагательных. Частицу можно использовать как с отдельными словами, так и со словосочетаниями:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=20%|
|width=70%|
|-
|mata-ney
|материнский; мамин
|-
|may-mata-ney
|моей мамы, принадлежащий моей маме
|-
|gran-oko-ney gela
|большеглазая девочка
|-
|turan-ney
|внезапный
|-
|lekti-ney
|(про)читанный
|-
|davem-lekti-ney
|давно прочитанный
|-
|lai-ney
|пришедший
|-
|tri-ney
|третий
|-
|}


* Для выражения отрицательного отношения используются общие частицы-префиксы '''fuy'''- (выражает презрение, отвращение) и '''shma'''- (выражает пренебрежение). Эти частицы чаще всего используются с существительными, однако возможно использование и с другими частями речи:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=10%|
|width=70%|
|-
|fuy-jen
|гадкий, противный человек
|-
|shma-kaval
|лошаденка, кляча
|-
|shma-skribi
|нацарапать (в смысле неаккуратно написать)
|-
|}


== Специальные ==

''' Частицы существительного'''

* Пол человека или другого живого существа можно уточнить с помощью частиц-префиксов '''man'''- и '''gin'''-:
leker (врач) - man-leker (мужчина-врач) - gin-leker (женщина-врач)
doga (собака) - man-doga (кабель) - gin-doga (сука)

То же значение (для существительных на -a) можно выразить с помощью суффиксов -'''o''' и -'''ina''': dogo, dogina.

* Отсутствие кровного родства выражается частицей-префиксом '''stif'''-:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=10%|
|width=70%|
|-
|stif-mata
|мачеха
|-
|}

* Отсутствие прямого родства выражается частицей-постфиксом -'''inloo''':

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=10%|
|width=70%|
|-
|brata-inloo
|неродной брат ''(например, двоюродный)''
|-
|}

Заметим, что формы с -inloo скорее разговорные, так как они имеют очень общее значение. Для уточнения рекомендуется употреблять составные слова типа bratadocha - дочь брата (=племянница).


'''Частицы глагола'''

* Частица-префикс '''ko'''- обозначает общность, совместность:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=10%|
|width=70%|
|-
|ko-senti
|сопереживать
|-
|ko-existi
|сосуществовать
|-
|}

* Частицы-префиксы вида '''en'''- и '''ek'''- обозначают, соответственно, начало и однократность (и/или внезапность) действия:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=10%|
|width=70%|
|-
|en-krai
|начать кричать
|-
|ek-krai
|вскрикнуть
|-
|}

* Определительная частица -'''ke''' образует прилагательные от словосочетаний с глаголам (с одиночными глаголами она выступает как суффикс и пишется слитно):

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=20%|
|width=70%|
|-
|mucho-safari-ke gunsa
|работа, связанная с поездками
|-
|treba-zwo-ke gunsa
|работа, которую нужно сделать
|-
|hao-yusi-ke sikin
|удобный нож
|-
|}

* Частицы -'''ney''' и -'''she''' образуют причастия:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=10%|
|width=70%|
|-
|davem-lekti-ney
|давно прочитанный
|-
|sun-lai-she
|который скоро придет
|-
|}

* Частица -'''yen''' образует деепричастия:

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=10%|
|width=70%|
|-
|shwo kan-yen
|говорить, глядя; говорить и смотреть
|-
|}

== Сокращённые формы слов с частицами -ney и -she и их производными  ==

От прилагательных на -ney можно образовывать наречия (-nem) и абстрактные существительные (-nesa, пишется слитно):

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=20%|
|width=70%|
|-
|parta-ney ''(частичный''
|parta-nem ''(частично, отчасти)''
|-
|ofensi-ney ''(обиженный)''
|ofensi-nem ''(обиженно)''
|-
|adapti-ney ''(приспособленный, приспособившийся)''
|adaptinesa ''(приспособляемость_''
|-
|}

Также -ney в прилагательных, образованных от существительных, может меняться на -nish (-nish = -ney + -ish):

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=10%|
|width=70%|
|-
|amiga-nish
|как будто приветливый
|-
|}


От прилагательных (причастий) на -she можно образовать наречия (-shem) и существительные со значением деятеля (-sha):

{| style=&quot;width:100%;padding-left:15%;;&quot;
|-
|width=20%|
|width=70%|
|-
|respekti-she ''(уважающий)''
|respekti-shem ''(уважительно)''
|-
|ahfi-she ''(прячущий)''
|ahfi-shem ''(украдкой, тайком)''
|-
|kapti ''(ловить)''
|kapti-sha ''(ловец)''
|-
|}


Для прилагательных на -ney, образованные от существительных, оканчивающихся на Ca (где С – согласный), допустимо сокращение типа Ca-ney =&gt; Ce: farka-ney =&gt; farke

Получающиеся таким образом прилагательные могут участвовать в словообразовании:
parta-ney - parte - partitaa (частичность)

Заметим, что если –ney выражает генитив, сокращение не делается:
mata-ney kitaba (не *mate kitaba)


Для прилагательных (причастий) на -ney, образованные от неодносложных i-глаголов, допустимо сокращение  Ci-ney =&gt; Cen:
ofensi-ney =&gt; ofensen

Для производных наречий типа Ca-nem и Ci-nem допустима сокращение типа Cem:&lt;br&gt;
farka-nem =&gt; farkem&lt;br&gt;
kontra-nem =&gt; kontrem&lt;br&gt;
ofensi-nem =&gt; ofensem.

При отсутствии двусмысленностей допустимы и сокращения типа Ci-shem =&gt; Cem:&lt;br&gt;
ahfi-shem =&gt; ahfem.


В составе слова может быть более одного аффикса и/или частицы:
* kalme - nokalme - nokalmitaa (беспокойство)

= Словосложение =

Сложные слов в лидепла можно образовывать путем сложения простых слов. Значение получившегося сложного слова зависит в первую очередь от классов составляющих его простых слов.

Заметим, что сложные слова обычно пишутся слитно, хотя, для улучшения читаемости, особо длинные слова могут писаться через дефис.

== Сложение полнозначных слов ==

Всякое сложное слово состоит из двух частей: главное слово и определитель, при  этом главное слово всегда находится в конце сложного слова.

Чаще всего значение сложного слова можно объяснить с помощью словосочетания. Например, suryflor (подсолнечник) = flor do surya, skribitabla (письменный стол) = tabla fo skribi. Однако важно понимать, что значение сложного слова часто всё же несколько отличается от значения словосочетания: словосочетание характеризует нечто конкретное, например конкретный предмет, тогда как сложное слово задает класс предметов. То есть tabla fo skribi - это сообщение о том, что данный кокнретный стол служит для письма (&quot;стол, за которым пишут&quot;), skribitabla - слово, обозначающее целый особый класс столов, используемых для письма (&quot;письменный стол&quot;).


'''Существительное + существительное'''

Значение &quot;особый вид&quot;:

* spikabush ''(терновник)'' (= bush do spika)
* gubrajuk ''(навозный жук)'' (= juk do gubra)
* botelabrash ''(щетка для бутылок)'' (=brash fo botelas)
* kindashamba ''(детская (комната))'' (=shamba de kinda)
* sabahfan ''(завтрак)'' (=fan do sabah)
* chaychiza ''(чайная ложка)'' (=chiza do chay)
* kavaldom ''(конюшня)'' (=dom do kaval)
* legumgarden ''(огород)'' (=garden do legum)
* batalakraisa ''(боевой клич)'' (=kraisa do batala = krai duran batala + sa)
* mauskapter ''(мышеловка)'' (=kapter do maus = kapti maus + er)

В некоторых случаях значение главное слова в сочетании несколько отличается от его основного значения:
* kindagarden ''(детский сад)'' (=garden-si do kinda)

Значение &quot;часть&quot;:
* harriza ''(корни волос)'' (=riza de har)
* kaudanok ''(кончик хвоста)'' (=nok de kauda)
* daokrosa ''(перекресток)'' (=krosa de dao)

Сочетания с другими значениями, соответствующие словосочетаниям с предлогом de, обычно рассматриваются именно как сочетания, а не сложные слова, и пишутся через дефис:
* surya-luma солнечный свет (=luma de surya)
* monta-kadena горная цепь (=kadena de monta)


Ряд слов используются в сочетаниях рассматриваемого типа настолько часто, что по своему значению приближаются к суффиксам, так что сочетанию обозначают скорее не вид главного слова, а слово, производное от слова-определителя.
* jen, man, gina (человек):&lt;br&gt;
jadujen колдун / колдунья, jaduman колдун, jadugina колдунья (jadu - колдовство)&lt;br&gt;
arkuman лучник, стрелец (знак зодиака) (arku - лук (оружие)) (=man do arku)&lt;br&gt;
fishgina русалка (fish - рыба) (= gina to fish)&lt;br&gt;
* lok (от loko)(место)&lt;br&gt;
malinalok малинник (malina - малина) (= loko do (mucho) malina)&lt;br&gt;
kabralok кладбище (kabra - могила)&lt;br&gt;
montalok горы, гористая местность
* menga (множество, скопление):&lt;br&gt;
jenmenga толпа (=menga de jen)&lt;br&gt;
moskamenga рой мух (moska - муха)
* guan (&quot;общественное заведение, учреждение&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
fanguan столовая&lt;br&gt;
kitabaguan библиотека&lt;br&gt;
* yuan (&quot;служащий, работник, член персонала, член какой-то организации&quot;; &quot;работник по..., работник в..&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
shopyuan работник магазина&lt;br&gt;
polisyuan полицейский&lt;br&gt;
dwaryuan привратник, швейцар&lt;br&gt;
agniyuan пожарный (=agnibrigadayuan)&lt;br&gt;
maryuan моряк&lt;br&gt;
trenyuan проводник (в поезде)&lt;br&gt;

Ср.: marjen морской человек (жизнь связана с морем), maryuan моряк (работа связана с морем), marnik (любитель моря / морской жизни).


'''Глагол+существительное'''

Чаще всего сочетания типа &quot;глагол+существительное&quot; задают вид понятия/предмета, выраженного главным словом, и их значение можно представить в виде словосочетания с предлогом fo:
* saltikorda скакалка (=korda fo salti)
* lernikitaba учебник (=kitaba fo lerni)
* skribitabla письменный стол (=tabla fo skribi)
* chifantabla обеденный стол (=tabla fo chifan)
* guntaim рабочее время (=taim fo gun)
* frisiguan парикмахерская (=guan fo frisi)
* habitilok место проживания, жильё (=lok(o) fo habiti)
* banishamba ванная (комната) (=shamba fo bani)
* banipen ванная (=pen fo bani)

Значение может быть не буквальным:
* fukiflor одуванчик


Некоторые сочетания типа глагол+существительное можно рассматривать как сочетания причастие+существительное:
* flaifish летучая рыба (=flai-she fish)
* sendijen посланник (=sendi-ney jen)


'''Прилагательное + существительное'''

Сочетания типа &quot;прилагательное+существительное&quot; называют вид понятия, обозначаемого главным словом:
* laojen старик (ср. lao jen - старый человек (конкретный))
* chyenlok отмель (ср. chyen lok(o) - мелкое место (какое-то))

Прилагательные на -e могут отбрасывать конечный гласный:
* platbota плоскодонка (вид лодки, ср. plate bota - плоская лодка)
* garibjen чужак, чужестранец (ср. garibe jen - чужой человек)


'''Полнозначное слово + прилагательное'''

Прилагательные достаточно редко выступают в качестве главного слова сочетания. Слова такого типа обычно пишутся через дефис.
* hema-rude - кроваво-красный, красный как кровь
* guy-lao антикварный


'''Существительное + глагол'''

Сочетание глагола с его дополнением можно представить в форме сочетания существительное+глагол, если необходимо подчеркнуть процесс в целом. Сочетания такого типа встречаются достаточно редко, пишутся через дефис, например: ala-trepi -  хлопать крыльями

Syao faula ala-trepi kun yoshi pyu denada. Маленькая птица еще отчаяннее захлопала крыльями.

Слово fin (&quot;конец&quot;) используется как приставка со значением завершенности действия: lekti - finlekti (дочитать, прочитать до конца).


'''глагол+глагол'''

Речь идет о действии, которое заключается либо в одновременно совершаемых действиях, либо имеет свойства обоих действий. Как и во всех словах, главным словом сочетания является последнее слово. Составляющие сочетание глаголы пишутся через дефис.
* embrasi-karesi прижимать к себе; ласкать, обнимая
* lai-dansi приближаться, танцуя (важен характер жвижения - танцевальный)
* dansi-lai приблизиться, танцуя (важно приближение)
* sheiki-swingi трясти и качать


'''Сочетания с простыми наречиями и местоимениями'''

Простые (односложные) наречия и местоимения могут участвовать в образовании сочетаний. Сочетания такого типа пишутся через дефис.
* for-gun продолжать работать (=gun for), for-gunsa продолжение работы, дальнейшая работа
* pro-guverna-ney проправительственный круги, pro-westa-ney прозападный
* swa-luba себялюбие; swa-kontrola самоконтроль.

== Сочетания с предлогами ==

Предлоги могут выступать в качестве приставок (производные слова такого типа пишутся слитно):
* aus - из, ausen - вне&lt;br&gt;
auslanda - заграница&lt;br&gt;
* kontra - против, в оппозиции, в противоположности&lt;br&gt;
kontrakosa противоположность&lt;br&gt;
kontratoxin противоядие&lt;br&gt;
kontrapon противопоставить
* tra - насквозь, от начала до конца&lt;br&gt;
tralekti прочитать насквозь, от начала до конца&lt;br&gt;
tranochi переночевать

= Сочетание всех способов словообразования =
* landa - auslanda – auslandajen (иностранец/иностранка)
* taim - same taim - samtaimjen (современник/современница)
* chi - chi gro - chigronik (обжора)
* dom - sin dom - sindomnik бездомный

= Язык в фокусе: французский =

Французский язык относится к романской группе языков, но именно французский дальше всех отошел от народной латыни.
До покорения Римом на территории нынешней Франции проживали галлы - племена кельтской группы. Галлия была одной из римских провинций в течение пяти веков, начиная с II - I вв до н.э., и за это время местное население постепенно ассимилировалось с римлянами и перешло на их язык, сохранив, однако, в речи так называемый &quot;кельтский субстрат&quot;, то есть следы исчезнувшего древнего местного языка.

После падения Рима в V веке н.э. Галлия была завоевана германскими племенами, самыми сильными из которых были франки. Конечно, язык завоевателей некоторым образом повлиял на язык местного населения, однако победил в конечном итоге именно народнолатинский язык, как более развитое наречие. И к IX веку на севере Франции сформировался новый общий язык - французский, который к XVI веку стал главным средством коммуникации в государстве.

Отрывок из Маленького принца на языке оригинала:
''(во французском языке ударение всегда на последний слог)''

&lt;!-- Please add categories to the bottom of this page, and add interwikis to Wikidata. --&gt;
Optimized version of the code template, specialized for Java Programming examples.

==Usage==

Based around Template:code, but with a few of the defaults changed so it's optimised for the purpose of Java examples, all that's really needed is the title and code:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{Java_Code_File
| header=JavaExample.java
| source=
Class JavaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
    }
}
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This will look like this:
{{Java_Code_File
| header=JavaExample.java
| source=
Class JavaExample {
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        System.out.println(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
    }
}
}} 
&lt;!--=== See also ===--&gt;
&lt;includeonly&gt;
&lt;!-- Categories go here, and interwikis go on Wikidata. --&gt;

      <comment>/* Drawing Geometry without color */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Drawing Geometry &lt;u&gt;without&lt;/u&gt; color ==
This is how you pass the vertex data for triangles to OpenGL.

The data is specified in an array, where every three vertices represents a new triangle. In this format the data needs to be specified in the order that they will be connected. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;

#include &lt;gl\glew.h&gt;
#include &lt;MyGLWindow.h&gt;

void MyGLWindow::initializeGL(){
	GLfloat verts[] =
	{
                //1st Triangle
		+0.0f, +1.0f, +0.0f, //Vertex 1
		-1.0f, -1.0f, -0.5f, //Vertex 2
		+1.0f, -1.0f, +0.5f, //Vertex 3
                //2nd Triangle
		+0.0f, -1.0f, +0.0f, //Vertex 1
		-1.0f, +1.0f, -0.5f, //Vertex 2
		+1.0f, +1.0f, +0.5f, //Vertex 3
	};
	GLuint myBufferID;
	glGenBuffers(1, &amp;myBufferID); //Generate an identifier for the buffer ID
	glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, myBufferID); //Bind it to the array buffer binding point
	glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(verts), verts, GL_STATIC_DRAW); //Send the size of the data and the data to the buffer assigned to the array buffer binding point.

	//Describing the data
	glEnableVertexAttribArray(0); //The first attribute to send to openGL (later redirected through a vertex shader)
	glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0,0); //There are 3 floats per vertex...
}

void MyGLWindow::paintGL(){
	glViewport(0, 0, width(), height()); //Fixes the resizing to change ratio of triangle
	glDrawArrays(GL_TRIANGLES, 0, 6); //Connect the 6 vertices into triangles (triangle=3, 6/3 = 2 triangles)
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This code could easily be altered to just pass 2D data only, to do this you'll need to change two things:
* The array should only say the X and Y coordinate.
* glVertexAttribPointer parameter 2 will need to be changed from 3 to 2.

== Optimised Drawing of Geometry ==
This new version of the program passes the ids of the positions of the vertices to say how the triangles should be connected. For basic triangles that aren't connected, this is less efficient than before, how for most shapes, triangles will share vertices, this will mean that you won't need to specify 3 pieces of data (XYZ, more if color and light normals are added), you only pass an extra short for the index of the vertex. This saves on RAM as less data is needed, and for animated geometry, it will mean that less duplicate data will need to be sent to OpenGL and beyond.
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;

#include &lt;gl\glew.h&gt;
#include &lt;MyGLWindow.h&gt;

void MyGLWindow::initializeGL(){
	GLfloat verts[] =
	{
                //1st Triangle
		+0.0f, +1.0f, +0.0f, //Vertex 1
		-1.0f, -1.0f, -0.5f, //Vertex 2
		+1.0f, -1.0f, +0.5f, //Vertex 3
                //2nd Triangle
		+0.0f, -1.0f, +0.0f, //Vertex 1
		-1.0f, +1.0f, -0.5f, //Vertex 2
		+1.0f, +1.0f, +0.5f, //Vertex 3
	};
	GLuint myBufferID;
	glGenBuffers(1, &amp;myBufferID); //Num buffers, BufferID
	glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, myBufferID);
	glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(verts), verts, GL_STATIC_DRAW);

        //Assigning the positions of the vertices into 2 triangle (triangle 1= {0,1,2}, triangle 2={3,4,5})
        GLushort indices[] = {0,1,2,  3,4,5};
	GLuint indexBufferID;
	glGenBuffers(1, &amp;indexBufferID); //Generate an identifier for the index buffer ID
	glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, indexBufferID); //Link the index buffer to the element array buffer binding point
	glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(indices), indices, GL_STATIC_DRAW); //Send the size of the data and the data to the index buffer, linked to the element array buffer binding point.

	//Describing the data
	glEnableVertexAttribArray(0); //The first attribute
	glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, 0,0); A vertex consists of 3 floats
}

void MyGLWindow::paintGL(){
	glViewport(0, 0, width(), height()); //Fixes the resizing to change ratio of triangle
	glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, 3, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, 0); //Notice this is different from above
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Drawing Geometry &lt;u&gt;with&lt;/u&gt; color (keeping optimisations from before) ==

Note: The color won't work until you set up the [[Guide_to_Game_Development/Rendering_and_Game_Engines/OpenGL/GLSL_Shaders/Fragment_Shader|fragment shader]]. However, to setup the [[Guide_to_Game_Development/Rendering_and_Game_Engines/OpenGL/GLSL_Shaders/Fragment_Shader|fragment shader]] you need to send the color data from the [[Guide_to_Game_Development/Rendering_and_Game_Engines/OpenGL/GLSL_Shaders/Vertex_Shader|vertex shader]].

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;

#include &lt;gl\glew.h&gt;
#include &lt;MyGLWindow.h&gt;

void MyGLWindow::initializeGL(){
	GLfloat verts[] =
	{
                //One colourful triangle being drawn
		+0.0f, +1.0f, +0.0f, //Vertex 1
                +1.0f, +0.0f, +0.0f, //Vertex 1's Color (Red)

		-1.0f, -1.0f, -0.5f, //Vertex 2
                +0.0f, +1.0f, +0.0f, //Vertex 2's Color (Green)

		+1.0f, -1.0f, +0.5f, //Vertex 3
                +0.0f, +0.0f, +1.0f, //Vertex 3's Color (Blue)
	};
	GLuint myBufferID;
	glGenBuffers(1, &amp;myBufferID); //Num buffers, BufferID
	glBindBuffer(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, myBufferID);
	glBufferData(GL_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(verts), verts, GL_STATIC_DRAW);

        GLushort indices[] = {0,1,2};
	GLuint indexBufferID;
	glGenBuffers(1, &amp;indexBufferID);
	glBindBuffer(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, indexBufferID);
	glBufferData(GL_ELEMENT_ARRAY_BUFFER, sizeof(indices), indices, GL_STATIC_DRAW);

	//Describing the data
	glEnableVertexAttribArray(0); //The first attribute (Vertex data)
	glVertexAttribPointer(0, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, sizeof(float) *6,0); //There are 6 floats worth of data from the start of one list of vertices and the next set of vertices
	glEnableVertexAttribArray(1); //The second attribute (Color data)
	glVertexAttribPointer(1, 3, GL_FLOAT, GL_FALSE, sizeof(float) *6, (char*)(sizeof(float)*3)); //There are 6 floats worth of data from the start of one list of vertices and the next set of vertices. The first piece of data starts after 3 floats.
}

void MyGLWindow::paintGL(){
	glViewport(0, 0, width(), height()); //Fixes the resizing to change ratio of triangle
	glDrawElements(GL_TRIANGLES, 3, GL_UNSIGNED_SHORT, 0);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Lojbanic acronyms are formed simply by stringing the names of the ''lerfu'' together in a ''cmene''. For example, the acronym BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) would be written in Lojban as ''la bybycys.'' (remember: ''cmene'' mustn't end in a vowel!). Also, for vowels, it is not required to write them ending in ''-bu'', all that is requred is that it is obvious that the letter sound is there. So NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) would be written as ''la ny'asy'as.'' (or ''la ny,asy,as.'', just so long as there are no nonsensical vowel clusters).
There are a few quirks here and there, as Lojban is not known for its range of sounds (especially semivowels). Just remember these when transliterating acronyms: h=''x'', y=''j'', w=''v''.

Here are some examples of Lojbanic acronyms:

-CNN (Cable News Network): ''la cynynys.''

-DFTBA (Don't Forget To Be Awesome): ''la dyfytyby'as.''

-NBC (National Broadcasting Company): ''la nybycys.''

-USA (United States of America): ''la .usy'as.'' (remember: ''cmene'' starting in a vowel must have a &lt;.&gt; in front of them)

-USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics): ''la .usysyrys.''

-USAPATRIOT (Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Approprate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism): ''la .usy'apy'atyry'i'otys.''

-GLaDOS (Genetic Life-form and Disk Operating System): ''la gyly'ady'osys.''

-LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation): ''la ly'asy'erys.''

-SCUBA (Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus): ''la sycy'uby'as''

-TASER (Thomas A. Swift's Electric Rifle): ''la ty'asy'arys.''

-ATM (Automatic Teller Machine): ''la .atymys.''

Now try to come up with some of your own acronyms!</text>

;Purpose and usage
This is the same template internal code as [[Template:Key_press]], but allows colorized keys (using parameter |CO=color), as an alternative colorizing HTML wrapper, and expresses ''the browser'' (user's) ''default monospace font'' within the {{wp|Digital_container_format|wrapper}} (or {{wp|Container (abstract data type) |container}}). 
* The parameter &lt;nowiki&gt;|p= if defined (i.e. {{{p}}})&lt;/nowiki&gt; will express as a suffix, without padding. This is intend to encapsulate Hotkey definitions with an explanation following in the same font uses such as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Kb|CTRL|V|p= (Paste)}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; 
;example
: ... then press {{Kp|CO=blue|CTRL|V|p= (Paste)}} to put the value in the spreadsheet cell...
&amp;nbsp;
* As a default, the brother template {{tlx|Kp}} displays as a black motif, as will Keypress.

The usage is linked next below and is common to all three template calls:
{{Key press/doc}}
{{FormTemp}}&lt;/div&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Design Patterns=

For many readers, the techniques that we use in GUI programming might seem odd.
Frequently, the reader may have used objects mainly to model the entities and structures in their code fairly directly; if we have a program that uses points, we will have a 'point' class, and its methods will be the operations that we can perform on 'points'.
In contrast, in GUI programming, we will frequently use language features to achieve organizational and structural ends; we will build classes that are designed to be composed into trees, or designed to contain instances of other classes, or perform other purely 'structural' ends.

Many of these structural techniques are in fact not unique to GUI programming; they are in fact common techniques.
There are some organizational problems that are common; they recur frequently in different programs.
For some of these common problems, software engineers have developed schematic common solutions; we call these 'design patterns'.

Many of the organizational techniques that we use in GUI programming are in fact instances of general design patterns; it may be to the reader's general benefit to discuss these patterns in a general context.

Students should consult the Wikipedia article on [[wikipedia:Software_design_pattern|Software Design Patterns]].
Perhaps the seminal text on the subject of design patterns is the book ''[[wikipedia:Design_Patterns|Design Patterns]]''.

==The Compositor==

We use the [[wikipedia:Composite_pattern|Compositor]] design pattern in the design of the &lt;code&gt;BasicWidget&lt;/code&gt; class.

==The Decorator==

We use the [[wikipedia:Decorator_pattern|Decorator]] pattern extensively in GUI toolkits; many container widgets are Decorators.

==The Observer==

Most toolkits use some variant of the [[wikipedia:Observer_pattern|Observer]] pattern to implement their event systems.</text>

==== Usage of France Regions Labelled Map ====
This {{tl|France Regions Labelled Map}} template is placed on a page, and it shows up!

This template incorporates extensive calls to the {{Tl|image label small}} template with X-Y co-ordinates, and typing parameters and wraps these labels around the image, which may have co-ordinates be defined and synchronized with the X-Y labeling co-ords. The {{tl|image label begin}} and {{tl|Image label end}} templates nest the whole sandwich, establishing the image, frame, co-ordinates, and X-Y offsets for Image label small to display. As can be seen by the actual code shown below, the setup is both straight forward and can be quite involved. (the Commented-out Section titles in the actual template are restored in the below:
&lt;div style={{TRS-style|BG=Ivory;}}&gt;
;For technical reasons: and simplicity, only a smattering of the code below is shown as a template (blue). Among other things, note the use of embedded HTML &amp;lt;br/&amp;gt; break-line occurrences.
&lt;tt&gt;
&amp;nbsp;

{{tlx|Image label begin|image=France fond de carte 27 régions.png|width={{{width|400}}}|float={{{float|right}}}}}&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Let's examine our program from last time in more detail.

__TOC__

==Code &amp; explanation==
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

These includes are required by the standard, so anyone who wants to offer a proper C++ compiler must provide them. Several includes are required that way, and the set of them is called the '''standard library'''.
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;iostream&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; allows us to use &lt;code&gt;std::cout&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;std::cin&lt;/code&gt;. All of our programs will include it, because they're all console programs.
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;string&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; is needed anytime you want a '''string''' (a value that represents text), which will also be all of our programs.


&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
int main()
{
	std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
As mentioned before, &lt;code&gt;int main&lt;/code&gt; is required for all C++ programs. Ignore the parentheses and curly brackets for now; just know that they're necessary.

&lt;code&gt;std::cout&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;std::cin&lt;/code&gt; are for console ''out''put and ''in''put, respectively. &lt;code&gt;std&lt;/code&gt; is the '''namespace''', which basically means who gave them to us, and this one is the ''standard'' namespace - i.e., these are from the standard library. The &quot;c&quot; just means C++ inherited them from its &quot;parent&quot; language, C.

The &quot;\n&quot; at the end of the string is a '''line break''' or '''newline'''; it causes further text to be printed on an additional line.

==Vocabulary==
; standard library: several useful pieces of code required by the C++ standard, shipped with all C++ compilers, all under the namespace &lt;code&gt;std&lt;/code&gt;.
; string: a value that represents text.
; namespace: a directory of names, or where to look for something by name.
; newline: a character which separates two lines of text. Also called a '''line break'''. Syntax: &lt;code&gt;\n&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Functions are so important to programming that teaching control structures has been rather tedious without them, so with great relief let's see how to make our own.

==Code==
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

// Calls to this function evaluate to float.
float readFloat()
{
	std::string temp;
	std::cin &gt;&gt; temp;
	return std::stof(temp);
}

// This one returns char.
char readChar()
{
	std::string temp;
	std::cin &gt;&gt; temp;
	return temp[0];
}

// Another function returning float.
float evaluate(float a, char oper, float b)
{
	switch (oper)
	{
	case '+':
		return a + b;
	case '-':
		return a - b;
	case '*':
		return a * b;
	case '/':
		return a / b;
	}
}

int main()
{
	float a, b;
	char oper;

	// The ultimate truism, this never stops being true.
	while(true)
	{
		std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Enter two numbers and an operator (+ - * /).\nOr press Ctrl+C to exit.\n&quot;;

		// Parse two floats from standard input.
		a = readFloat();
		b = readFloat();
		// And a character.
		oper = readChar();

		std::cout &lt;&lt; a &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; oper &lt;&lt; &quot; &quot; &lt;&lt; b &lt;&lt; &quot; = &quot; &lt;&lt; evaluate(a, oper, b) &lt;&lt; &quot;\n&quot;;
	}
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==Explanation==
Woohoo, the code just got much easier to read, once you understand functions.

As the comments kind of explain, each function has a '''return type''' before its name. A function's return type will be the type of any calls to that function. A '''function call''' is an expression which causes a function to be run, such as &lt;code&gt;std::stof(temp)&lt;/code&gt;. When the control flows over a &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; statement, the containing function exits. The function's '''caller''' then receives the '''return value''' as the value of the function call and continues from that point.

&lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; can stand in for &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; in a &lt;code&gt;switch&lt;/code&gt;. The point is that control doesn't &quot;fall through&quot; from one case to another. C++ does allow that to happen, but it can be very confusing and it's rarely useful.

By now, you've probably noticed that &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; has a return type of int. It's the only non-void function that you don't need to &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; from; by default, it returns 0 when control reaches the bottom. 0 indicates that the program was successful, or ran without problems; any other value tells whoever ran the program that something went wrong. These values are called &quot;exit codes&quot;, but you won't need to specify one anytime soon.

Functions also have '''parameters''', the variables declared between their parentheses. Any function call must provide a value for each of the function's parameters; these values are called '''arguments'''.

Finally, a function must appear in the source before any call to it. However, C++ offers an important loophole to this that we'll cover later.

==Exercises==
''under construction''

==Vocabulary==
; return type: the type of value that any call to a specific function will be resolved to.
; function call: an expression which causes a function to be run.
; caller: the function which contains a specific function call.
; return value: the value that a specific function call will be resolved to.
; void: a return type meaning that nothing is returned.
; parameter: a variable in a function which is assigned by each call to that function.
; argument: the value of a parameter for a specific call to a function.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== IRR , computation , Newton's Method ===
Project valuation may require finding the Internal Rate of Return, or the discount rate at which
a project's present value of future cash flows equals to zero. This is the maximum rate of return achievable, and
should be greater than the inflation rate. 
a simple converging guessing method has been illustrated under the Project Valuation chapter. The use of Newton's method
was left as an exercise, and a possible solution is shown below. Newton's method finds the x-axis intersection of the gradient line found at an approximate IRR, which will give a better rate to try for IRR, and iterations will find an acceptable IRR where the NPV is small enough to be equal to zero. 

background for derivative function of npv:
   Axiom: for bx&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; , 
   
     d  ( bx&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;)  / dx  =  ab x&lt;sup&gt;a-1&lt;/sup&gt;

   Hence, if,
   
     npv = CF0 / R&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + CF1 / R&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + .. + CFn / R&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;,
   
     or npv = CF0 + CF1 x R&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; + CF2 x R&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; + .. + CFn x R&lt;sup&gt;-n&lt;/sup&gt;,
   
   then , 
  
     d(npv)/dR = 0 x CF0 x R &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;  + - CF1x R &lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; + - 2 CF2x R &lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; ... + -n x CFn x R&lt;sup&gt;-n - 1&lt;/sup&gt;.

# better R'  which is closer to where the function curve crosses the x-axis, and this is done iteratively until

      <text xml:space="preserve">Up to now, we've only covered what has been used in our programs, but that's leaving some irritating gaps. This chapter is to fill those gaps.

==Loops==

===&lt;code&gt;do..while&lt;/code&gt;===
There's another kind of loop we haven't mentioned:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
do
{
	//...
}
while(condition);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
As you might have guessed, this is very similar to a while loop. A '''do..while loop''' reverses the two things done by an ordinary while loop, which are:
# check condition, exit if false;
# run loop body.

A while loop repeats those two steps over and over until the condition tests false. A do..while loop, in contrast, repeats them like this:
# run loop body;
# check condition, exit if false.

The effect is that a do..while loop guarantees one iteration, whereas a while loop might not run its body at all. This is useful, in particular, when you're reading data from somewhere else, like a file, and whether you should continue depends on what you've read.

===&lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt;===
Loops can be a whole lot more complicated than &quot;start..repeat until X..exit&quot;. That complexity can be a very bad thing, but it can also be very useful.

For example, completing a loop is not the only way out. Remember the &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statements used in switches? Well, they can also exit loops. If you have a loop in a loop in a loop (another example of nasty complexity), &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; will only exit the smallest one it's in. If you have a switch in a loop, &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; inside the switch will only exit the switch.

If you like, imagine that the language starts from the &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; statement, searches backward through the code, and exits the first loop or switch it finds.

Here's an example of &lt;code&gt;break&lt;/code&gt; in a loop:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

int main()
{
	std::string input;
	int count;

	std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Welcome to the lister! How many items would you like to list? &gt; &quot;;
	std::cin &gt;&gt; input;
	count = std::stoi(input);

	std::cout &lt;&lt; &quot;If you change your mind, enter STOP after the last item.\n\n&quot;;
	for(int i = 0; i &lt; count; i++)
	{
		std::cout &lt;&lt; (i + 1) &lt;&lt; &quot;. &quot;;
		std::cin &gt;&gt; input;
		if(input == &quot;STOP&quot;)
		{
			break;
		}
	}
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===&lt;code&gt;continue&lt;/code&gt;===

      <comment>Add chapter about the insect olfactory system</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">While the human sensory system offers us stunning ways of perceiving our movement and environment, the sensory systems of insects and spiders are not any less fascinating. To give just a few examples, spiders have up to eight eyes, and some see almost as sharply as humans; bees &quot;feel the rhythm&quot; when other bees dance in the bee-hive, and learn from this the location of food sources; mosquitoes hunt their victims by smell. In addition, studies in insects have many fewer ethical or methodological limitations than studies in mammals. And especially in flies, with molecular genetic tools any gene can be targeted (e.g. knocked out or overexpressed), and the system is much more manageable than in humans.


==The insect olfactory system==
This sensory systems book is mostly about human sensory systems and there is a chapter about the olfactory system, so why do we need a chapter on the insect olfactory system?
The fruit fly (''drosophila melanogaster''), which we will focus on here, is a very important model animal in biology and a lot of research on sensory systems is done in the fruit fly. The visual as well as the olfactory system are studied intensively and there are less ethical or methodological limitations. With molecular genetic tools, any gene in a fly can be targeted (e.g. knocked out or overexpressed) and the system is much more manageable than in humans. While the olfactory system functions quite different from the human’s, it is possible to find common principles. Furthermore, the insect olfactory system inspires engineering in robotics, medicine and many other areas.

===The nature of smell===
[[File:Insect antennae comparison.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Different antenna types.]]
To understand the specifics of odor sensing one has to be aware that smell is quite different from other stimuli. It differs from light and sound by the fact that it is not carried by waves but by diffusion, air flows and turbulences. Furthermore, while light and sound only have the two perceptually relevant characteristics of frequency composition and amplitude, smell has a variety of discrete odorants and even more possible mixtures in different concentrations. 

===Overview===
[[File:Drosophila melanogaster antenna microscopic.jpg|thumb|Drosophila melanogaster antenna under a light microscope. The olfactory sensilla can be seen (like hairs on the antenna). The antenna is fixated with a glass capillary and on the top right a recording electrode can be seen. The diameter of the antenna is about 90 µm.]]
[[File:Schematic insect basiconic sensillum.png|thumb|Simplified schematic of a basiconic sensillum, like it can be found for example in the fruit fly.]]
In insects (but also in most vertebrates) the sensory system is of importance for orientation and food foraging but has also social (nest mate recognition e.g. in ants) and sexual (mating partner search and selection by pheromones) significance.
The main path of the odor information begins at the olfactory sensilla (insect’s sensory organs that contain the sensory neurons) that can in most insects be found on the antennae and look like small hairs in the fly (see Figure). There exists a huge variety of antenna types (that are not only used for olfaction) and many different sensillum types. 

To understand the general principle the example of drosophila melanogaster basiconic sensilla should suffice. 
The odorant molecules go through slits or pores of the cuticle into the aqueous sensillum lymph, where some types of odorant molecules are bound to odorant binding proteins and carried towards the dendrites of the olfactory receptor neurons (ORN), others diffuse in the lymph towards the dendrites. On the membrane of the dendrites there are odorant receptors (OR) that bind the odorant molecules and are responsible for the conversion of the signal into a membrane current. This current propagates through the dendrite to the cell body where (at the axon hill), an action potential is generated. The action potential travels in the ORN axon to the antennal lobe (which is analog to the olfactory bulb in vertebrates), where ORN make synapses to local interneurons and projection neurons. The antennal lobe is organized in so called glomeruli. It is not fully understood how they are involved in pattern recognition, but the glomerular activation pattern can provide information about the odors presented to the fly.

Projection neurons project into the lateral horn (where probably innate odor responses are processed) and to the Kenyon cells in the mushroom bodies. The mushroom bodies are a neuropil in the insect brain and have their name from the similarity to mushrooms. There, odors are associated with other sensory modalities and behavior which is why the mushroom bodies are an important model system to study learning and memory. 

===Odorant reception in ORN===
[[File:Response profile drosophila odorant receptors.PNG|thumb|500px|response profile of selected drosophila odorant receptors to two odors. Data source: DoOR Database [http://neuro.uni-konstanz.de/DoOR/default.html]]]
An insect’s olfactory sensillum contains one or more olfactory receptor neurons that transform the odor information into an electrical signal (action potential). Most ORNs contain only one receptor type, but each receptor type reacts to many odors (see Figure). However there are some receptors that are more specific as their detected odors have either an important role in the insect’s behavior or are chemically unique. An example for a more specific receptor is the receptor for CO2. Other odorants activate it only weakly and it directly triggers an avoidance response in the fly &lt;ref&gt;Suh GS, Ben-Tabou de Leon S, Tanimoto H, Fiala A, Benzer S, Anderson DJ: Light activation of an innate olfactory avoidance response in Drosophila. Curr Biol 2007, 17:905-908.&lt;/ref&gt;. Specificity of ORs is due to different affinity of odorants to the receptor. The higher the affinity the more receptors are occupied when an odor is applied and the stronger the current response. However, ORNs do not react linearly on stimulation. It can be assumed that most of them respond logarithmic within their working range which increases their dynamic range. The logarithmic relation does not apply to stimuli below the respective detection threshold and in saturation.
Most ORN show a phasic-tonic on-response, i.e. they react with a strong increase in firing rate when a stimulus is presented and then show rate adaptation if the stimulus persists.

Odorant receptors are membrane proteins that elicit an ionic current through the membrane, when an odorant molecule binds to them. There are two ways how this is accomplished in the olfactory system:
Metabotropic and ionotropic receptors.
In mammals olfactory receptors are known to be metabotropic g-protein coupled receptors that release a g-protein into the cell that activates an ion channel via a short intracellular signal cascade .
In contrast most olfactory receptors in insects are ionotropic receptors that are ion channels which open when an odorant molecule binds. Saving time on the signal cascade, ionotropic receptors are much faster than metabotropic receptors &lt;ref&gt;Silbering AF, Benton R (2010) Ionotropic and metabotropic mechanisms in chemoreception:  'chance or design'? EMBO reports 11:173-179.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Odor information processing===
The odor that reaches the antenna contains different parts of information:
On the one hand the odor identity, i.e. which odor or mixture it is, on the other hand the quantity of the components. Furthermore, the timing of the stimulus contains information. If two odors start for example at the same time, it is probable, that they belong to the same object. It has been shown, that insects indeed use the odorant timing information not only to detect the direction of an odor source but also to distinguish and track odor objects &lt;ref&gt;Baker TC, Fadamiro HY, Cosse AA (1998) Moth uses fine tuning for odour resolution. Nature  393:530-530.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justus KA, Schofield SW, Murlis J, Carde RT (2002) Flight behaviour of Cadra cautella males in  rapidly pulsed pheromone plumes. Physiological Entomology 27:58-66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Szyszka P, Stierle JS, Biergans S, Galizia CG (2012) The Speed of Smell: Odor-Object Segregation  within Milliseconds. PloS one 7:e36096.&lt;/ref&gt;. The processing mechanism that enables this behavior is not clear, but it is amazing that already stimulus onset delays in the range of a few milliseconds can be useful.
There are recent results that suggest that the speed and the temporal resolution of the insect’s olfactory system are remarkable and much higher than expected. 

By means of calcium imaging, a method that visualizes cytoplasmic calcium by a fluorescent marker and therefore activity in neurons, it is possible to create a functional atlas of the antennal lobe. 
Basically all ORNs of one receptor neuron type, containing one OR, project into one glomerulus. So the (in the fruit fly about 54) glomeruli each unite the response of one receptor type and form a spatial pattern. However it has been shown that also the temporal dynamics of the glomeruli response is used to encode information &lt;ref&gt;DasGupta  S,  Waddell  S  (2008)  Learned  Odor  Discrimination  in  Drosophila  without  Combinatorial Odor Maps in the Antennal Lobe. Current biology : CB 18:1668-1674.&lt;/ref&gt;. The odor information is therefore encoded in the olfactory system by spatiotemporal firing patterns &lt;ref&gt;Brown, S. L., Joseph, J., &amp; Stopfer, M. (2005). Encoding a temporally structured stimulus with a temporally structured neural representation. Nature neuroscience, 8(11), 1568-1576.&lt;/ref&gt;.

So far it has not been possible to disentangle and understand the odor code in a way that is comparable to the knowledge of the visual and the auditory system. This might be due to the peculiarities of smell discussed above. There is no easily mappable topographic organization of neurons as the odor space is multidimensional and not continuous.

Glomerular activity patterns are linked in the mushroom bodies to behavior. Most insects show a high amount of plasticity there and e.g. bees are able to associate odors with a food reward after only a few presentations. Odor Information in the mushroom bodies is said to be represented by a sparse code, which means that only few kenyon cells respond with only few spikes. In contrast the above described code in the antennal lobe and in the ORNs it is a combinatorial code.

===Odor perception and behavioral significance===
For insects the olfactory system is of great behavioral significance. For example, as we all have probably experienced first-hand, mosquitos can track their victims by smell. Ants follow pheromone traces to food sources, but are also able to identify their nestmates by a colony specific hydrocarbon profile (and are therefore able to eliminate foes and thieves when they enter their territory). And many moths use sex pheromones to find mating partners. 

Usually odors in nature are not pure chemical substances but mixtures. However, those mixtures are perceived as a unit and are very often directly linked to a behavior. The neuronal response in the antennal lobe of a mixture cannot always be predicted by the response to the components &lt;ref&gt;Silbering, A. F., &amp; Galizia, C. G. (2007). Processing of odor mixtures in the Drosophila antennal lobe reveals both global inhibition and glomerulus-specific interactions. The Journal of Neuroscience, 27(44), 11966-11977.&lt;/ref&gt;. It should therefore not be taken for granted that the olfactory system works like an e-nose that is designed to analyze the components of the presented odor. Furthermore, compared to vision, where the information has to be processed deeply until the relevance of the content becomes obvious, the olfactory system is more strongly and directly linked to behavior (and at least in higher animals emotions). These connections are sometimes innate, but often also learned and idiosyncratic.

Childhood is an important time where parents can help their children develop life long, healthy eating habits. 
This page is designed to provide practical information for parents of young children to make healthy food choices.

==What do children need?==

'''Adequacy''' –  The Australian Dietary Guidelines [https://www.nhmrc.gov.au/_files_nhmrc/publications/attachments/n55f_children_brochure.pdf] provides current advice for families about the types of foods and the amounts that children need to eat for health and growth. 
Inadequate nutrition may result in failure to thrive and learning difficulties. Changes in appetite are normal and generally a decrease in appetite correlates with a slowing down of the growth rate. 

'''Balance''' - Food provides energy and nutrients required for growth and development. A balanced diet ensures their bodies function at optimal performance.

'''Consistency and Continuity''' – Children can be fussy eaters. The early years of life are a time when young children establish life long eating patterns and food preferences. A child’s hunger is a parents’ best friend when introducing a new food. 
Gradual repeated exposures to new foods might assist with food acceptance. Serve new foods in small amounts with familiar and readily accepted foods. It may take 10 or more experiences before a child will accept the food.

==Healthy Eating Habits ==
[[File:Kids ‘n Fiber (6121371164).jpg|thumb|Kids ‘n Fiber (6121371164)]]
'''1.''' It’s important to let the child eat in response to appetite and to have healthy, nourishing food available. We are born with an incredible ability to respond to our own hunger and fullness. We recommended that parents provide the food to eat and children then decide, whether to eat and how much they want to eat. 

'''2.'''	Eating breakfast and family meal times. Young children’s behaviours are inquisitive in nature, they enjoy imitating others behaviours. Shared meal times are key opportunities to allow independence with feeding and food choices whilst encouraging new foods.

'''3.'''	General recommendation:  1 tablespoon of food per year of age, more if the child asks for more.

==Notable Nutrients==
[[File:Soy-whey-protein-diet.jpg|thumb|Soy-whey-protein-diet]]
==='''Protein'''=== 
Important for growing bodies, muscle and bone development. Protein can be found in foods such as milk, lean meat, eggs, yoghurt, cheese. 

==='''Iron'''===  
Essential for optimal growth, brain development, the delivery of oxygen around our body and helps to fight off infections. Not enough iron can lead to iron deficiency anaemia, a condition where the body is unable to produce enough red blood cells for normal functioning. Sources include lean meat, poultry, nuts and legumes.
[[File:ARS - Foods high in zinc.jpg|thumb|ARS - Foods high in zinc]]
==='''Zinc'''=== 
Supports growth and development, helps fight off infections, healthy skin, appetite.  Meat, eggs, dairy, wholegrain breads and cereals, nuts and seeds.

==='''Calcium'''=== 
Crucial for bone strength, development and muscle function. Aim to include dairy at meals and snacks. Easy ideas include milk with breakfast or in a smoothie, yoghurt as a snack and cheese in a sandwich.

==='''Fibre'''===  
Helps to keep us full and can protect against constipation, bowel cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Enjoy a range of fruits, Vegetables, Wholegrain breads and cereals.

==='''Omega 3 fatty acids'''=== 
Protect against heart disease and stroke and are important for healthy brains and nerves.  Great sources of omega 3’s include fish such as tuna and salmon, red meat, canola oil and walnuts.

==Practical advice==

===Smart Snacks===
[[File:Veggie pasta bento (3948839857).jpg|thumb|Veggie pasta bento (3948839857)]]
Snacks are essential to provide the additional energy and nutrition toddlers require.

Sultanas, carrot sticks and cheese sticks

Fresh fruit – banana, apple, orange, pear, grapes, melon, berries

Smoothies – Milk, yoghurt, Fruit 

Plain popcorn

Low fat yoghurt or a glass of milk

Small homemade muffin

Homemade vegetable pikelets with corn, zucchini and mushroom

==Take home messages==

Speak about foods as everyday or sometimes foods

Family meals. Only cook one meal for the entire family. Sit down, engage in conversation and enjoy the home cooked meal together

Make food fun and adventurous – “I spy” games to encourage consumption of new food, Vegetables that turn into superheros. Aeroplanes that get shy and hide away.

Use hunger as your best friend when introducing new foods

Don’t use food as a reward for good behaviour. Stickers or stamps are a great alternative.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Scientologists who were all highly-placed members of the church's paramilitary wing pretending to be Scientologists, are working with the outside criminals, government corruption, Scientology kidnappers and stealing assets. Roman Catholics from a huge world wide crime gang and Psychiatrists, have been working under cover, in the churches.  Now, they are working on murdering Scientologists all round the world.  They are driving them to &quot;meetings&quot;, to visit members of the public, under false presences. When the Scientologists arrive, the are &quot;greeted&quot; by their murder.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''&lt;big&gt;1.e4 e5 2.Qh5 g6&lt;/big&gt;'''

This move is a blunder because this allows 2.Qxe5+! creating a deadly fork to the King and the rook and thus, removes the King's right to castle '''kingside''', and removes his center control. The only good thing about this is that the Queen on h8 is kind of blocked and has no where to go. And when black plays very good plays good moves while white wasn't able to escape his Queen on the side, it could be trapped easily and thus, gaining a major piece which could really help in winning the game.


After 2.Qh4?, g6?? is not really recommended because of the fork on e5. Instead, we should play something like Nf6 attacking the Queen and preventing the famous Scholar's Mate with Bc4. Although this gives white the opportunity to capture on e5, we in return, gains tempo by 3.Qxe5+ Be7 then something like d4 to increase pressure in the center then just Nc6 and attack the Queen. If 4.Qg3?! or 4.Qg5?! attacking the g7 pawn, then simply castle short then we will have a good game.

With black's reaction of Nf6, White has just broke 2 rules in the opening. First, he put his Queen out too early. And second, he has moved a piece more than once before developing the minor pieces. With white having broken already  2 rules in the opening, we can easily have a good game. This is because white has too many Queen moves that he did not  have the chance to develop his minor pieces and castle atleast before move 10 while black has developed his minor pieces, has castled already, and gained a tempo. This gives black more chances of winning than white's. In short, black is winning the game.

'''Instructor, ENES 100&lt;br /&gt;'''

I have a M.Sc from Madurai Kamaraj University in India and I specialized in Electronics, Telecommunications and Physics.  I have a Ph.D degree in solid state physics from the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.  I did my doctoral dissertation research on semiconductor super-lattice devices and electronic materials.  

I have worked as a resident research associate at the U.S Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C, as a scientist at Boeing Satellite International (formerly known as Hughes Space and Communications Company) in Los Angeles, CA and a senior scientist at Hughes STX Corporation (now Raytheon Corporation).  I worked in communications electronics, electronic packaging, remote sensing, optical and electronic structural properties of natural diamond and thin CVD diamond films.

I taught graduate and undergraduate EE students and Physics students at universities and colleges in the US and in India for several years.  I have undertaken research at Morgan State University with graduate and undergraduate EE students, engineering/physics faculty colleagues, and industry partners on variety of topics, but primarily on RF/Microwave engineering, communication electronics, micro- and nano-electronics, antennas and electromagnetic radiation propagation, remote sensing, and photonics.  I have served as a faculty principal investigator of several electrical engineering research contracts and grants from government agencies, private industries and other research organizations.

I taught courses on &quot;Electric Circuits&quot; and &quot;Elements of Discrete Signals&quot; to students at Howard Community College during spring 2014 semester.

&lt;!-- Categories and interwikis go at the bottom of this page. --&gt;

{{tl|efn}} is used, together with {{tl|notelist}}, to create explanatory notes.

==Usage==
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{efn|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Footnote text''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{efn|name=&lt;/nowiki&gt;''footnote name''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Footnote text''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

'''{{Para|name}}''' Sets a standard reference name per [[WP:NAMEDREFS]].

&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{efn|group=&lt;/nowiki&gt;''footnote group''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Footnote text''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

'''{{Para|group}}''' Sets the [[WP:REFGROUP|group name]]. This defaults to ''lower-alpha''.

The available options are:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! group !! Styled as
|-
| note || &lt;sup&gt;[note 1]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| upper-alpha || &lt;sup&gt;[A]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| upper-roman || &lt;sup&gt;[IV]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| lower-alpha || &lt;sup&gt;[a]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| lower-greek || &lt;sup&gt;[α][β]&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
| lower-roman || &lt;sup&gt;[iv]&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

Remember that &quot;=&quot; cannot appear in an unnamed template parameter and &quot;|&quot; cannot appear in any template parameter. For &quot;|&quot;, {{tl|!}} can be used. For &quot;=&quot;, {{tl|{{=}}}} can be used or the parameter can be named 1= explicitly:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{efn|1=Converting at a rate of Kr&amp;nbsp;20&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;£1.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

==Examples==
Using full citations in footnotes:

{{markup|&lt;nowiki&gt;
Some information.&lt;ref name=Smith2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|year=2009|title=Smith's book}}&lt;/ref&gt; More information.{{efn|A clarification.&lt;ref name=Smith2009/&gt;}}

==Notes==
{{notelist}}

==References==
{{reflist}}

&lt;/nowiki&gt;|

Some information.&lt;ref name=Smith2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|year=2009|title=Smith's book}}&lt;/ref&gt; More information.{{efn|A clarification.&lt;ref name=Smith2009/&gt;}}

{{fake heading|Notes}}
{{reflist|group=lower-alpha|close=1}}&lt;!-- Notelist does not support &quot;close&quot;; nor should it, outside of doc pages--&gt;

{{fake heading|References}}
&lt;references /&gt;
}}

Using {{sfnote}}:

{{markup|&lt;nowiki&gt;
Some information.{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=1}} More information.{{efn|A clarification.{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=2}}}}

==Notes==
{{notelist}}

==Citations==
{{reflist}}

==References==
* {{citation|last=Smith|year=2010|title=Smith's book}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;|

Some information.{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=1}} More information.{{efn|A clarification.{{sfn|Smith|2010|p=2}}}}

{{fake heading|Notes}}
{{reflist|group=lower-alpha|close=1}}&lt;!-- Notelist does not support &quot;close&quot;; nor should it, outside of doc pages--&gt;

{{fake heading|Citations}}
{{reflist|close=1}}

{{fake heading|References}}
* {{citation|last=Smith|year=2010|title=Smith's book}}
}}

You can create multiple explanatory lists by closing {{tl|notelist}}. This is useful when adding sources to elements such as multiple tables.
{{markup
|&lt;nowiki&gt;Some information.&lt;ref name=Smith2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|year=2009|title=Smith's book}}&lt;/ref&gt; More information.{{efn|A clarification.&lt;ref name=Smith2009/&gt;}}

==Notes==
{{notelist|close}}

Some more information.&lt;ref name=Smith2009&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|year=2009|title=Smith's book}}&lt;/ref&gt; More information.{{efn|A further clarification.&lt;ref name=Smith2009/&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">I disagree with the analysis section regarding Dumbledore's look of triumph in GoF. The article suggests that Dumbledore was triumphant because Wormtail gained a silver hand. 

However, a much more likely theory (which I think is hinted at in Deathly Hallows) is that Dumbledore realized Voldemort taking Harry's blood meant that they were bound together &quot;closer than any two other wizards in history&quot;.  It was this sharing of blood that enabled Harry's return from the dead, and I believe Dumbledore at least partially realized this the night of the graveyard duel.

[[User:Harmkahis|Harmkahis]] ([[User talk:Harmkahis|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Harmkahis|contribs]]) 00:59, 7 September 2014 (UTC)

:Well, that theory is mentioned elsewhere, but as you point out it is not germane here. Simplest course of action is to simply remove the misleading clause. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:59, 7 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

&amp;nbsp;
This template ''''TTip'''' (TrainzTip inline) is adapted from {{Tl|LeftBox}} but skips the box class statement and uses a span to wrap the text. It is meant for short tips or points.

&lt;small&gt;Below, the template with typesetters test text:&lt;/small&gt;

* &lt;small&gt;''Adapted from {{Tl|TextBox}} for more user friendly style and inline notations.''&lt;/small&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
;usage
* The template call is normally &lt;code&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{LeftBox|'your text'}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, where the first placeholder parameter (''same as: &lt;code&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|1= &lt;/nowiki&gt;''your text'')&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is the normal text entry mode when calling the template.
* Normal mode is &lt;code&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TTip | your text goes here }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;/code&gt;.
{{LeftBox/doc/doc-common}}
&lt;hr&gt;
;Image options
* '''image''' (optional) : the image to be used.
:*The &lt;code&gt;| size= &lt;/code&gt; option may be given to override the default 25x25px size.
:* The &lt;code&gt;| IVA= &lt;/code&gt; option may be given to change HTML/CSS {{Col|vertical-align:top|blue}} to middle or bottom for the image in it's leftside box. The default is ''''top'''' so it floats up against the overall padding of the surrounding box.

      <text xml:space="preserve">One of the major attractions of the PSP are it's wealth of popular Japanese games and visual novels; few of which have been released in English-speaking countries. Some crafty people have taken up translation projects to bring the experience over the language barrier.

== Completed Projects ==

[http://akatranslations.wikispaces.com/PSP+Translations Here is a longer list to draw from.]

Our wikipage will improve on that guide with extended description, and archived xdeltas (to ward off link rot).

=== Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (Project Zetsubou) ===

* [http://danganronpa.wordpress.com/2013/06/23/release-danganronpa-english-translation-v1-0/ English Patch v1.0 Download]

This patch requires &quot;The Best&quot; edition, which is an improved rerelease.

----

Danganronpa runs flawlessly on 6.60 PRO-C and LME. 

[http://danganronpa.wordpress.com/2013/06/23/release-danganronpa-english-translation-v1-0/#comment-614 5.00 m33 will require patches] due to version restrictions. 5.50 Prometheus has freezing/crashing issues.

=== Hatsune Miku ===

Most of these only have the menus translated.

=== xClannad PSP ===

* [http://nicoblog.org/psp-iso/clannad-english-patched-psp/ Download]

Clannad: The most touching and most extensive (SFW) visual novel of them all. 

Note that this translation uses the xClannad engine, ported from Linux. 

There is an official version of Clannad for PSP, but it was so large, it used two discs. If you ran that from ISO, you would have needed a special homebrew app that can switch discs when prompted.

== Making your own Translations ==

The basic process is to unzip the ISO file, decompile some binaries, make your edits, zip it back up, and create an xdelta.

Obviously this needs more elaboration...</text>

There are many [[wikipedia:List of Vegetarians|famous figures]] who follow or have followed a vegetarian diet. Historically, vegetarian diets were mostly associated with a [[wikipedia:History of vegetarianism|religious or ethical belief]]; today more people adopt the diet due to concerns about the environment or the rights of animals. According to the last nutrition survey conducted in Australia in 1995, around 4% of the population followed a purely vegetarian diet, however many more regularly eat vegetarian meals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Australian Dietary Guidelines&quot;/&gt; 

Well-planned vegetarian diets are associated with a lower risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure, lower blood lipid levels, and lower risk of Type 2 diabetes. &lt;ref name=&quot;Australian Dietary Guidelines&quot;&gt;National Health and Medical Research Council (2013) ''Australian Dietary Guidelines''. Canberra: National Health and Medical Research Council.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because a vegetarian diet typically includes more fibre, vitamin C, vitamin E, phytochemicals, and folate &lt;ref name=&quot;ADA: Vegetarian Diets&quot;&gt;American Dietetic Association (2009) Position of the American Dietetic Association: Vegetarian Diets. &quot;Journal of the American Dietetic Association&quot;. 109(7). doi: 10.1016/j.jada.2009.05.027. &lt;/ref&gt;. 
However, vegetarians should make sure that their diet contains a wide variety of animal products (such as milk and eggs) and plant foods, because there are many essential nutrients that they may miss out on.

==Important Nutrients to keep in mind==
===Calcium===
[[File:Swiss cheese cubes.jpg|thumb|Swiss cheese cubes]]
Calcium plays an important roles in bone health, in particular, maintaining the strength and structure of bones. Consuming the right amounts may reduce the risk of osteoporosis. &lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding Nutrition&quot;&gt;Whitney, E., Rolfes, SR, Crowe, T., Cameron-Smith, D. &amp; Walsh, A. (2011). Understanding Nutrition: Australia and New Zealand Edition. South Melbourne, Australia: Cengage Learning Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Calcium has many important roles in the body, and close to 99% of it is stored in our bones&lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding Nutrition&quot;/&gt;. The best food sources are dairy (milk, cheese, and yoghurt), fortified soy milk, dried apricots, spinach, and broccoli. It is recommended that adults should consume 1,000mg of calcium per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nutrient Reference Values&quot;&gt;NHMRC (2014) Nutrient Reference Values for Australia and New Zealand. Retrieved September 20, 2014, from http://www.nrv.gov.au/nutrients.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron===
[[File:Tofu-beijingchina.jpg|thumb|140px|Cooked tofu]]
Iron is crucial for storing and transporting oxygen around the body, and is important for energy levels and the immune system. Iron deficiency is very common, especially in women who menstruate, as they generally lose about 15mg of iron every month! &lt;ref name=&quot;Nutrient Reference Values&quot;/&gt; Symptoms of low iron intake include: fatigue, bruising easily, paleness, frequent headaches, and shortness of breath. &lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding Nutrition&quot;/&gt; The recommended intakes for young adults are 8mg for men and 18 mg for women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nutrient Reference Values&quot;/&gt; 
Red meat,eggs and fish/seafood are the best iron sources, because these contain the &quot;haem&quot; type of iron&lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding Nutrition&quot;/&gt;. In contrast, plant sources of iron, such as quinoa and spinach are in the &quot;non-haem&quot; form.  &quot;Haem&quot; iron is absorbed better by the body, however vegetarian can boost their absorption of &quot;non-haem&quot; iron by eating foods rich in vitamin C (for example, adding tomato to a bean and vegetable soup). Other chemicals that interfere with iron absorption are: tannins in tea/coffee, zinc in food, phytates found in plants, and calcium.  
For vegetarians, dairy is a poor source, hence their main sources of iron are eggs and plant foods, including spinach, tofu, fortified cereals, and beans. [[File:Spinach with garlic.jpg|thumb|Spinach cooked with garlic]]

===Vitamin B12===
[[File:Milk glass.jpg|thumb|left|150px|A glass of milk.]]This member of the B-vitamins group is very important for vegans and vegetarians because the only good sources are animal products&lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding Nutrition&quot;/&gt;. B12 can only be produced by certain microorganisms, such as bacteria, which live in the gut of animals. For vegetarians, eggs and dairy are the best sources; additionally, there are many vegetarian products that are fortified with B12 such as vegetarian bacon and tofu. For vegans or those who consume very little dairy, a B12 supplement should be considered.  
B12 is involved in the synthesis of DNA, activation of genes, red blood cell production, and maintaining the myelin sheath on nerves (which insulates and protects them).&lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding Nutrition&quot;/&gt; Low intake for a long period of time can lead to irreversible nerve damage, memory loss, or depression. The current recommended intakes for adults is 2.4 µg/day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nutrient Reference Values&quot;/&gt;

===Zinc===
[[File:Almonds.jpg|thumb|140px|Almonds]] [[File:Genova-pane.jpg|thumb|140px|Italian wholemeal bread and wholegrain bread with olives]] Finally, zinc is similar to iron in that it is absorbed better from animal products, however there are many more vegetarian sources of this vital mineral&lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding Nutrition&quot;/&gt;. Zinc has roles in immunity, smell, taste, appetite, growth, skin health, and vision, so low intake can lead to an array of symptoms. For men, zinc is important for sperm health, so their recommended intake is 14mg/day, while for women it is 8mg/day&lt;ref name=&quot;Nutrient Reference Values&quot;/&gt;.  
There are a variety of foods that contain high amounts of zinc, including dairy, eggs, mushrooms, nuts/seeds, beans, and wholegrain bread&lt;ref name=&quot;Understanding Nutrition&quot;/&gt;. Dark chocolate, parsley and Vegemite are very high sources per 100g of the product, however it is very uncommon to eat such an amount!    

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
|-
! TOP vegetarian sources of Zinc
|-
| Dairy/eggs
|-
| Nuts/seeds
|-
| Wholegrain bread
|}

==How can I include these in my diet?==
For vegetarians, it is best to consume eggs/dairy products everyday to make up for the absence of meat/fish. Other important foods are green leafy vegetables, beans/legumes, nuts, fortified vegetarian products, and wholegrain bread/cereal. 

Some practical tips: [[File:Muesli.jpg|thumb|140px|Breakfast idea: Muesli and milk.]] [[File:Salad platter.jpg|thumb|140px|left|Lunch idea: Salad with a variety of ingredients such as vegetables, beans, cheese, or nuts]]
*Having a variety of breakfasts throughout the week. For example, toast with peanut butter on Monday, yoghurt with muesli on Tuesday, scrambled eggs on Saturday etc. 
*Chopped carrots/cucumber with dairy based dip or hummus. 
*Having mixed dishes for your main meals, such as a salad with feta or adding beans to a tomato pasta sauce.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Scottish Surname - Hetherington ==

Don't know if this is correct, as ''[[W:Hetherington]]'' states '''Hetherington''' as '''The surname Hetherington is of English origin, derived from a like-named place in Northumberland.''' Also, it states: '''A variant form of the surname is Heatherington. Forms of the surname have been recorded in Ireland since the 16th century.'''. For the time being  have rejected it to be added here, but please recheck and discuss here before adding it back. Danke Schôn. '''Jai Jinendra'''.

{{Documentation subpage|[[Template:LeftBox/doc]]|text2=This page is also documentation for the short space conservative {{TL|TTip|TTip template}}.
}}

{{LeftBox|W=auto|MW=auto|text=This Documentation sub-subpage is common text used in the usage (Template:documentation subpages) of several related templates (refer to whatlinks here). containing some common usage text boilerplate. &lt;hr&gt;If it seems to you that it begins in the middle without a lede paragraph or two, take a pat on the back for being an astute observer with excellent observational and ''at least'' elementary reasoning skills.
|3={{BullR
}}'''This page is also documentation for the short space conservative [[template: TTip|TTip template]].'''}}
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;tt&gt;...&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
:* Alternatively the &lt;code&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;1= or |2= and |3=&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/code&gt; placeholder parameters are also active. These can be used to wrap a text element with for example, a &lt;/code&gt;1=&amp;lt;div style=&quot;background:white;&quot;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;/code&gt;3=&amp;lt;/div&gt;&lt;/code&gt; so you might use an expanded call layout for clarity:
&lt;small&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
{{LeftBox
  |&lt;div style=&quot;background:white;&quot;&gt;     or  |1=&lt;div style=&quot;background:white;&quot;&gt; 
  |''your text goes here''             or  |text=''your text goes here''
  |&lt;/div&gt;                              or  |3=&lt;/div&gt;      
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
The actual pass argument evaluated is:
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1|}}}{{{text|{{{2|}}}}}}{{{3|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: where &lt;code&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|text=''your text'' &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/code&gt; has precedence over the evaluation of any &lt;code&gt;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/code&gt; pass parameter.

In such text, for example, the work around template &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;''''{{Tl|!}}''''&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; may be needed to display any {{wp|pipe character}} (''''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;{{!}}&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''') needed as well, while the exclamation point works normally.&lt;br&gt;
|3=&lt;span style=&quot;background:a9a9a9;width:100%&quot;&gt;{{Col|This text inside LeftBox with &lt;/code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|small=1&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;/code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|3='this text line'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; mode.|blue}}&lt;/span&gt;
}}
&amp;nbsp;
'''Other Parameters:'''
;The following is the actual styling code, and parameters should be obvious
&lt;pre&gt;
style=&quot;clear:{{{clr|{{{clear|all}}}}}}; max-width:{{{MW|1440px}}};width:{{{W|90%}}}; &lt;!--
--&gt; font-family:{{#if:{{{family|{{{FFAM|}}}}}}|{{{family|{{{FFAM|}}}}}}; |Garamond, Georgia, Times New Roman, Serif}};&lt;!-- 
--&gt;font-face: {{#if:{{{face|{{{FF|}}}}}}|{{{face|{{{FF|}}}}}}; |Garamond}};&lt;!--
--&gt; {{#if:{{{font-size|{{{FS|}}}}}}|font-size:{{{font-size|{{{FS|}}}}}}; |}}&lt;!--
--&gt; {{#if:{{{line-height|{{{LH|}}}}}}|line-height:{{{LH|{{{line-height|}}}}}}; |}}&lt;!--
--&gt; background:{{{BG|#fafafa}}}; color:{{{CO|#000000}}}&lt;!--
--&gt;margin:{{{M|{{{MT|5px}}} {{{MR|auto}}} {{{MB|5px}}} {{{ML|2px}}}}}}; &lt;!--
--&gt;padding:{{{P|{{{PT|2px}}} {{{PR|0}}} {{{PB|2px}}} {{{PL|0px}}}}}}; &quot;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
;The parameters in order of likely formatting fiddles
* The &lt;code&gt;| BG= &lt;/code&gt; option may be given to specify a different background color.
* The &lt;code&gt;| W= &lt;/code&gt; option may be given to adjust the width from default 90%.
:* The &lt;code&gt;| MW= &lt;/code&gt; option may be given to adjust the max-width from 1440px. Specify MW=auto to allow the box to go margin to margin.
* The &lt;code&gt;| P= &lt;/code&gt; option may be given to change the padding from 0px 25px; s.a. a more space economical '&lt;code&gt;P=0 8px 0 1.2em;&lt;/code&gt;' or the like.
* The &lt;code&gt;| VA= &lt;/code&gt; option may be given to change HTML/CSS {{Col|vertical-align:middle|blue}} to bottom or top for text. The default is ''''middle''''.
:* The &lt;code&gt;| BVA= &lt;/code&gt; option may be given to change HTML/CSS {{Col|vertical-align:top|blue}} to middle or bottom for the entire textbox. The default is ''''top'''' so it floats up against other elements.
:* See &lt;code&gt;| IVA= &lt;/code&gt; option below for images vertical-alignments.
* The &lt;code&gt;| clr=  or |clear=&lt;/code&gt; options may be given to change the clearance to left or right so to float the template beside other table elements.
:* ''Default is ''''left'''''' so this template box will nest under any left elements
:* and float ''beside right hand elements'' such as images or right margin navigation text boxes. 
:* Text may then flow around the elements and wrap in between Left and Right elements on a page frame. (Look at the left side of any Wikimedia page--most of the page is right floated beside it.)
 
;Parameters with inheritance
&amp;nbsp;
:* The template now defaults to Serif font families, as being less often found on web pages, the contrast should emphasize your message.  &lt;/code&gt;'|FF='&lt;/code&gt; selects a specific font face, ''&lt;font-color=blue&gt;provided your user has it on his or her browser&lt;/font&gt;''.
:*  &lt;code&gt;'FFAM' or 'family' &lt;/code&gt; can be used to change the default Font-Family declaration.
:*  &lt;code&gt;'LH or 'line-height' &lt;/code&gt; to scrunch lines closer and make the output more compact.
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;hr/&gt;
:* Individual  &lt;code&gt;margin and padding parameters &lt;/code&gt; are top, right, bottom, left &lt;u&gt;respectively&lt;/u&gt;:
::: &lt;u&gt;Individual margin settings&lt;/u&gt;: &lt;code&gt;'MT', 'MR', 'MB', and 'ML' &lt;/code&gt; and padding's:  &lt;code&gt;'PT', 'PR', 'PB', and 'PL' &lt;/code&gt; respectively.
* however, the definitions of  &lt;code&gt;''''''margin' and 'M'''' have precedence'' &lt;/code&gt; and setting inside parameters will be moot if either is defined. 

* also, the definitions of  &lt;code&gt;''''''padding' and 'P'''' will ''have precedence'' &lt;/code&gt; and setting inside parameters will be moot if either is defined.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Photostimulation of neurons ==
Photo-stimulation of neurons is an emerging field of research. Neuronal firing is achieved by shining a focused light source onto the nerve cell, causing it to depolarize. There are two major ways to approach this goal: irradiation of the neurons with a laser, inducing a local temperature gradient; and the introduction of light sensitive channels or receptors into the nerve cell making it sensitive to light, similar to rods and cones in the human retina.
Advantages over the traditionally used electric stimulation are increased precision and less to no tissue trauma.&lt;ref name=Szabota2010&gt;{{Cite journal | | last = Szobota | first = Stephanie | last2 = Isacoff | first2 = Ehud Y| year = 2010 | title = Optical control of neuronal activity. | journal = Annual review of biophysics | volume = 39 | pages = 329-348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electric vs Optic stimulation ===
Electric stimulation has inherent limitations compared to optic stimulation. To elicit reliable firing the electrodes have to be in physical contact with or in close proximity to the targeted tissue. Introduction of electrodes into the nerve tissue damages it and surrounding tissue.

In many cases the electrode array is introduced into electrically conductive tissue allowing for current spread, further decreasing the spacial resolution that can be achieved.

Measurement of the evoked neural activity is often contaminated by stimulation artefacts much larger than the measured neural activity. This is especially the case in measurements close to the excitation site.

In contrast, optic stimulation can reliably achieve excitation of single cells or small cell populations. It does not require direct contact to the target tissue, reducing tissue damage. Finally electrical recordings of neural response in close proximity are not contaminated by the excitation stimulus.&lt;ref name=Szabota2010 /&gt; &lt;ref name=Richter2011a&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Richter | first = Claus-Peter | last2 = Matic | first2 = Agnella Izzo | last3 = Wells | first3 = Jonathon D | last4 = Jansen | first4 = E Duco | last5 = Walsh | first5 = Joseph T | year = 2011 | title = Neural stimulation with optical radiation. | journal = Laser &amp; photonics reviews | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 68-80}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name= Wells2011 &gt;{{Cite book | last = Wells | first = Jonathon D| last2 = Cayce | first2 = Jonathan M| last3 = Mahadevan-jansen | first3 = Anita| last4 = Konrad | first4 = Peter E| last5 = Jansen | first5 = E Duco | title = Optical-Thermal Response of Laser-Irradiated Tissue | publisher = Springer Netherlands | chapter = Infrared Nerve Stimulation: A Novel Therapeutic Laser Modality | edition = 2 | date = 2011 | location = Dordrecht | pages = 915-939}}&lt;/ref&gt; Altough electrical stimulation suffers from the above mentioned drawbacks it is still the most well established and reliable method for nerve stimulation in patients.

=== Infrared Stimulation ===
Infrared stimulation is based on an infrared laser inducing a local temperature gradient inside the neuron. It does not require any modification of the cells prior to stimulation. The low energy laser does not cause damage to the tissue and elicits an artefact free stimulation. The exact mechanisms that lead to neuronal discharge are not known. However studies have shown that this phenomenon is is most likely due to local photothermal processes. Thus the IR irradiation creates a temperature gradient confined to a small space which rapidly vanishes after irradiation ceases. The local temperature rise of up to 9°C is thought to cause conformational changes in molecules ultimately leading to neuronal firing. At high irradiation frequencies the heat becomes additive, causing the irradiated tissue to heat up gradually and ultimately damaging the cell.&lt;ref name=Richter2011a /&gt;&lt;ref name= Wells2011 /&gt;

=== Optogenetics ===
Optogenetics is the sensitisation of cells to light by the introduction of foreign genes, allowing temporal and spatial high resolution alteration of neural firing patterns. The genes can be expressed in genetic modification of animals or be introduced by vectors like viruses. Most light sensitizing genes used today were first discovered in unicellular organisms like algae or archaea. These genes can encode light sensitive ion channels or receptors producing various responses to optic stimulation.

[[File:Opto-Gen.png|thumb|350px|Optical neural-firing manipulation techniques from left to right: '''ChR:''' blue light (480 nm) agitation of Channelrhodopsins (ChRs) leads to channel opening and Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; influx. Sodium ion influx leads to depolarisation and evokes neural firing. '''HR:''' Halorhodopsins are activated by yellow light (570 nm). Open channels allow chloride ions to enter the cell, leading to hyperpolarisation and thus inhibition of action potential formation. '''Opto-XR:''' Animal-Rhodopsins (light-green) are the light sensitive part in the constructs. The intracellular loops (dark-green) are exchanged for signalling sequences of the targeted pathways. Opto-XR excitation leads to alteration in the signal transduction and thus influences the cells responses and metabolism. '''IR-irradiation:''' Cell irradiation with infrared laser-pulses locally induces thermal gradients and provokes neural firing.]]

For neuronal activation natural Channelrhodopsins (ChR) or engineered genetic variants thereof are commonly used. ChRs are light sensitive non-specific cation channels, which open when excited with blue light (480nm). In nerve cells ChR opening leads to sodium influx and membrane depolarisation.&lt;ref name= Berthold2008 &gt;{{Cite journal | last = Berthold | first = Peter| last2 = Tsunoda | first2 = Satoshi P| last3 = Ernst | first3 = Oliver P| last4 = Mages | first4 = Wolfgang| last5 = Gradmann | first5 = Dietrich| last6 = Hegemann | first6 = Peter | year = 2008 | title = Channelrhodopsin-1 initiates phototaxis and photophobic responses in chlamydomonas by immediate light-induced depolarization. | journal =  The Plant cell| volume = 20 | issue = 6 | pages = 1665-1677}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name= Nagel2003 &gt;{{Cite journal | last = Nagel | first = Georg| last2 = Szellas | first2 = Tanjef| last3 = Huhn | first3 = Wolfram| last4 = Kateriya | first4 = Suneel| last5 = Adeishvili | first5 = Nona| last6 = Berthold | first6 = Peter| last7 = Ollig | first7 = Doris| last8 = Hegemann | first8 = Peter| last9 = Bamberg | first9 = Ernst

Halorhodopsin (HR) are light gated chloride ion pumps used for light activated neuronal inhibition.

Due to different stabilisation and thus wave length sensitivity differences of the retinal in HR and ChR, they can be used in the same cells and targeted separately. This allows for very close control of the activity in neural circuits.&lt;ref name= Zhang2007 /&gt;&lt;ref name= Han2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Han | first = Xue| last2 = Boyden | first2 = Edward S | year = 2007 | title = Multiple-color optical activation, silencing, and desynchronization of neural activity, with single-spike temporal resolution. | journal =  Plos one| volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = e299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For optical control of cell pathways the Opto-XR proteins were developed,&lt;ref name= Kim2005 &gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kim | first = Jong-myoung| last2 = Hwa | first2 = John| last3 = Garriga | first3 = Pere| last4 = Reeves | first4 = Philip J| last5 = Rajbhandary | first5 = Uttam L| last6 = Khorana | first6 = H Gobind | year = 2005 | title = Light-Driven Activation of 2 -Adrenergic Receptor Signaling by a Chimeric Rhodopsin Containing the 2 -Adrenergic Receptor Cytoplasmic Loops | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 44 | issue = 7 | pages = 2284-2292}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the X stands for the targeted signalling pathway. Opto-XRs consist of an animal-rhodopsin (bovine, rat etc.), with its intracellular domains exchanged for signalling sequences of the cell.&lt;ref name= Airan2009&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Airan | first = Raag D | last2 = Thompson | first2 = Kimberly R | last3 = Fenno | first3 = Lief E | last4 = Bernstein | first4 = Hannah | last5 = Deisseroth | first5 = Karl | year = 2009 | title = Temporally precise in vivo control of intracellular signalling. | journal = Nature | volume = 458 | issue = 7241 | pages = 1025-1029}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This allows optic regulation of the cells signalling pathway. The signaling sequences can either be activated or deactivated by conformational changes induced by light falling on the rhodopsin. This allows for specific activation of certain receptor pathways like serotonin or adrenergic signalling.&lt;ref name= Kim2005 /&gt;&lt;ref name= Oh2010 &gt;{{Cite journal | last = Oh | first = Eugene| last2 = Maejima | first2 = Takashi| last3 = Liu | first3 = Chen| last4 = Deneris | first4 = Evan| last5 = Herlitze | first5 = Stefan | year = 2010 | title = Substitution of 5-HT 1A Receptor Signaling by a Light-activated G Protein-coupled Receptor | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 285 | issue = 40 | pages = 30825-30836}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Optic stimulation in Neuro-Prosthetics ==
Electric stimulation has long been used for evoking nerve firing in neuronal prosthetics. However, spread of electrical current and generation of electric fields limit the spatial resolution that can be achieved. This limits the fidelity of the transmitted signal.&lt;ref name= McGill1982 &gt;{{Cite journal | last = McGill | first = K C | last2 = Cummins | first2 = K L | last3 = Dorfman | first3 = L J | last4 = Berlizot | first4 = B B | last5 = Leutkemeyer | first5 = K | last6 = Nishimura | first6 = D G | last7 = Widrow | first7 = B | year = 1982 | title = On the nature and elimination of stimulus artifact in nerve signals evoked and recorded using surface electrodes. | journal = IEEE transactions on bio-medical engineering | volume = 29 | issue = 2| pages = 129-137}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of auditory prostheses a maximum of around twenty electrodes is feasible, leaving the sound quality achieved far off the desired goal. A switch to optic based technology could achieve activation of smaller areas, increasing the amount of potentially perceived tones. Recent development in optic stimulation techniques promise ways to overcome those obstacles and improve prosthetic devices and the quality of live for patients.

=== Cochlear Implants ===
Infrared stimulation of the cochlea as well as the auditory nerve have been tested in various animal models such as rodents and cats. The optic variant shows remarkable precision concerning the area stimulated by the laser, which is approximately the same size as that activated by a medium loudness tone. It has also been shown that using low energy IR irradiation, constant stimulation can be achieved without gradual heating and damaging of the tissue. This enables the usage of the implant throughout the day without damaging the cochlear system. A major drawback of the IR stimulation is a much higher energy consumption compared to electrical stimulation.&lt;ref name=Richter2011a /&gt;

To overcome the energy problem described, researchers have begun to test an optogenetic approach in rodents. They genetically engineered mice to express Channelrhodopsins in spinal ganglion neurons. Sensitisation of the nerve cells reduced the energy required to induce firing compared to IR irradiation by a factor of seven (IR: 15 μJ, Optogen.: 2 μJ, Electric: 0.2 μJ). Stimulation was thus possible using μLEDs instead of lasers. In spite of this progress, implementation of this technology in humans in the near future is questionable. This is mainly due to the possible dangers of viral introduction of genetic material into an organism. Up to now only very few gene therapies have been approved. A save but still effective way of specifically infecting the cochlear organs would have to be implemented and approved.&lt;ref name= Hernandez2014 &gt;{{Cite journal | last = Hernandez | first = VH | last2 = Gehrt | first2 = Anna | last3 = Reuter | first3 = Kirsten | last4 = Jing | first4 = Zhizi | last5 = Jeschke | first5 = Marcus | last6 = Schulz | first6 = Alejandro Mendoza | last7 = Hoch | first7 = Gerhard | last8 = Bartels | first8 = Matthias | last9 = Vogt | first9 = Gerhard | last10 = Garnham | first10 = Carolyn W. | last11 = Yawo | first11 = Hiromu | last12 = Fukazawa | first12 = Yugo | last13 = Augustine | first13 = George J. | last14 = Bamberg | first14 = Ernst | last15 = Kügler | first15 = Sebastian | last16 = Salditt | first16 = Tim | last17 = Hoz | first17 = Livia de | last18 = Strenzke | first18 = Nicola | last19 = Moser | first19 = Tobias | year = 2014 | title = Optogenetic stimulation of the auditory pathway | journal = The Journal of Clinical Investigation | volume = 124 | issue = 3 | pages = 1114-1129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

First patents have been registered describing potential optical cochlear implants for humans. These implants function similar to the traditional electrical implants. But instead of the electrodes they have VCSELs (vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers) that are driven by the implant's input device. VCSELs are laser emitting diodes that can be fit into the small tubing of the implant. The lasers are directed at the organ of Corti and can be much closer spaced than electrodes, more than doubling the amount of implant output channels. Laser diodes are used for higher pitch signalling, while electrodes drive lower amplitude nerve cells.&lt;ref name= Stafford2013 &gt;{{Citation | inventor-last = Stafford | inventor-first = James W | inventor2-last = Stafford  | inventor2-first = Ryan C | publication-date = Jan. 24, 2013| issue-date = Jul. 21, 2012| title = OPTICAL-STIMULATION COCHLEAR IMPLANT WITH ELECTRODE(S) AT THE APICAL END FOR ELECTRICAL STIMULATION OF APICAL SPIRAL GANGLION CELLS OF THE COCHLEA | country-code = US | patent-number = 0023967 A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vestibular Prostheses ===
Vestibular Prostheses aim to restore imbalance issues arising from dysfunction of the vestibular system. Since the semicircular canals are interconnected, current spread is a major problem in electrical stimulus delivery. Current spread can lead to additional stimulation of unwanted semicircular canals, resulting in incorrect balance signals sent to the brain. The possibility of using IR irradiation has been investigated. Irradiation of the ampullae did ''not'' evoke action potentials. The reason for failing stimulation might lie in an insensitivity of the hair cells to IR irradiation. Nevertheless, optical stimulation of the vestibular nerve might be feasible. It is as of yet unclear if separate stimulation of the nerves from different ampullae is possible in this manner.&lt;ref name=Richter2011a/&gt;&lt;ref name= Harris2009a&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Harris | first = DM | last2 = Bierer | first2 = SM | year = 2009 | title = Optical nerve stimulation for a vestibular prosthesis | journal = Proceedings of SPIE | volume = 5 | pages = 71800R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Purpose
:This is the base (edit in one place) Trainz pages header template
:This template is used by various 'Book division header templates' such as {{Tl|FUN-top}} with {{Tl|ORP-top}} and similar templates with the purpose of visually dividing the work into multiple sections or divisions by class of page types.
;For example:Use the schema to set off Trainz Beginner oriented ([[:category:Introductory Trainz|Trainz basics]] and [[:category:Trainz AM&amp;C|beginner classed]] reference topics) in the [[Trainz|Trainz Wikibook]]) and organized Wiki pages from the advanced coverages listed in ''[[:category:Trainz references|Trainz reference pages]] and [[:category:Trainz Content Creation|Trainz Content Creation pages]]''.
;Page threading:This template is the workhorse template for threading the prev-next-grouped pages of the Trainz Wikibook.
=== Usage ===
This template while it can be called directly, is usually called as sub-template by a mnemonically named book division header template with the proper default display options handled by the calling template.
;Options
* Parameter alttitle1 can be defined to replace the Main title line.
:* Parameter CO1 can be defined to replace the Main title line color.&lt;br
/&gt;
* Parameter refs2 can be defined to trigger display of the second title line which defaults to &quot;&lt;font COLOR=&quot;GREEN&quot;&gt;'''{{{alttitle2|Trainz Annotated Reference Pages}}}'''&lt;/font&gt;&quot;.&lt;br
/&gt; 
:* Parameter alttitle2 can be defined to replace the Second title line.
:* Parameter CO2 can be defined to replace the Second title line's color. 
;Threading controls
: It is also used to thread related pages together based on the placeholder parameters equated with named parameters such that: &lt;/code&gt;{ 1=p, 2=n, 3=h, 4=dh }&lt;/code&gt;, where 
:# '''1 or p''' is a link template call building the page link to the '''previous page''' of a threaded group.
:# '''2 or n''' is a link template call building the page link to the '''Next page''' of a threaded group.
:# '''3 or h''' is a link template call building the page link to the '''Start page''' (subdivision or topic head) of a threaded group. This allows a threaded tutorial to refer back to a Tutorial Start or index page.
:# '''4 or dh''' is a link template call building the page link to the '''Head TOC page''' (division or subdivision head) of a threaded group. This link is always generated if any of the four (X2) parameters is defined, and defaults to the Book Master table of Contents page: [[Trainz]] Wikibook with a pipetricked link title &quot;Wikibook TOC&quot;.
The parameter logic will also define a footer which is CS/JS formatted onto the page bottom. This is opposite behavior to the {{Tl|TRS-page}} template which was placed at the page bottom, and floated links above other content on the page. This stylishly looks less appealing than incorporating the head-of-page prev-next et al. links within the header box, which is ''why this code was added here, even though a bottom edit would be easier to change page links''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page direly needs a complete rework. The attribute can be conveniently used to reach endian independence to a certain degree.

Together with another GNAT-specific attribute, I think, complete independence can be reached. But I myself have never used this attribute, so others may comment on this.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is Computing==
In this course, we try to focus on computing principles (big ideas) rather than computer technologies, which are tools and applications of the principles. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing Computing] is defined by a set of principles or ideas, which underlies a myriad of teachnologes that are created based on the principles. Technologies can be complex and constantly evolving but principles stays the same. In the second half of the course, we will study various technologies to demonstrate the power of computing and how principles are applied. 

In addition to principles of computing and technologies there are practices of computing - what professionals do to advance computing.  

The chart to the right illustrates the difference between principles of computing and practices of computing. Principles underly technologies and practices. A consumer exploits the power of computing through the applications built for them for various tasks. We believe everyone needs to know the principles of computing because such principles are widely applicable. As professionals in the field of computing we need to know the two ends and everything in the middle - the practices (activities and skills that make computing useful and effective).  

[[File:Principles v.s. Practices.jpg|600px|This chart illustrates the difference between principles of computing and practices of computing.]]

We will use the terms computing and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computation computation]  interchangeably throughout the book.

===Principles of Computing===
Computing is fundamentally about information processes. One of the big ideas of computing is that information processes can be carried out purely mechanically via symbol manipulation. The agent that does the computing, whether a thinking human being or a machine (computer), does not matter. Toward the end of the book we will see this is true for all modern computers - digital computers manipulate two symbols (zero and one) blindly according to instructions.

====An Analogy====
The following analogy from the &quot;Thinking as Computation&quot; book &lt;ref&gt;[[Hector J. Levesque|Levesque, Hector]],Thinking as Computation,  Hector J. Levesque, ISBN: 9780262016995  &lt;/ref&gt; illustrates the idea. Imagine that we have the following table of symbols.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! a !! b !! c !! d !! e !! f !! g !! h !! i !! j
|-
| a || aa || ab || ac || ad || ae || af || ag || ah || ai || aj
|-
| b || ab || ac || ad || ae || af || ag || ah || ai || aj || ba
|-
| c || ac || ad || ae || af || ag || ah || ai || aj || ba || bb
|-
| d || ad || ae || af || ag || ah || ai || aj || ba || bb || bc
|-
| e || ae || af || ag || ah || ai || aj || ba || bb || bc || bd
|-
| f || af || ag || ah || ai || aj || ba || bb || bc || bd || be
|-
| g || ag || ah || ai || aj || ba || bb || bc || bd || be || bf
|-
| h || ah || ai || aj || ba || bb || bc || bd || be || bf || bg
|-
| i || ai || aj || ba || bb || bc || bd || be || bf || bg || bh
|-
| j || aj || ba || bb || bc || bd || be || bf || bg || bh || bi
|}


The symbols can be any set of symbols, we pick the letters from the English alphabet for simplicity. We can define a procedure P that takes two symbols ('a' through 'j') as the input and produces two symbols in the same set as the output. Internally, the procedure uses the first input symbol to find a row that starts with the same symbol, then uses the second input symbol to find a column with the same symbol at the top, and then report/return the symbols at the cross point. It is not hard to imagine such a table lookup procedure can be done purely mechanically (blindly) by a simple agent (e.g. a device or a machine). Of course a human being can do it but this type of symbol manipulation requires no human intelligence. Two conclusions can be drawn from this thought experiment:
* Symbol manipulation can be done mechanically.
* The machine that performs the manipulation does not need to know the meaning of the symbols nor the purpose of the manipulation.

This procedure can be meaningful if we know how to interpret the symbols. For example, if the symbols 'a' through 'j' represent quantities of 0 through 9 respectively, this procedure performs single decimal digit addition. For instance, p(d, f) = p(3, 5) = ai = 08, which is the correct result of 3+5. The following table is essentially the same as the previous one except that it uses symbols that are meaningful to humans. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  !! 0 !! 1 !! 2 !! 3 !! 4 !! 5 !! 6 !! 7 !! 8 !! 9
|-
| 0 || 00 || 01 || 02 || 03 || 04 || 05 || 06 || 07 || 08 || 09
|-
| 1 || 01 || 02 || 03 || 04 || 05 || 06 || 07 || 08 || 09 || 10
|-
| 2 || 02 || 03 || 04 || 05 || 06 || 07 || 08 || 09 || 10 || 11
|-
| 3 || 03 || 04 || 05 || 06 || 07 || 08 || 09 || 10 || 11 || 12
|-
| 4 || 04 || 05 || 06 || 07 || 08 || 09 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13
|-
| 5 || 05 || 06 || 07 || 08 || 09 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14
|-
| 6 || 06 || 07 || 08 || 09 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15
|-
| 7 || 07 || 08 || 09 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16
|-
| 8 || 08 || 09 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17
|-
| 9 || 09 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17 || 18
|}

Now that we have a simple procedure P that can instruct a simple agent to add two single digit decimal numbers, we can devise a new procedure P1 that can add three single-digit decimal numbers as shown in the following chart. 

[[File:P to P1.svg|600px|This chart illustrates a way to build a P1 procedure from a P1 procedure.]]

The new procedure P1 employs three instances of procedure P to add three decimal digits and return two digits as the result. We can view the procedures as machines with inputs and outputs and the lines are pipes that allow the symbols to go from one place to another place. It is not hard to imagine that an agent that can carry out P can carry out P1 as P1 is entirely made up of P. Note that the dotted rectangle represents the new procedure P1 made up of instances of P and the answer given by P1 for the sample inputs is correct. Again the symbols used in the process can be any set of symbols because internally simple table lookups are performed. 

Now imagine that we could use P1 to construct more complex procedures, for example procedure P2 in the following chart. 

[[File:P1 to p2.svg|600px|This chart illustrates a way to build a P2 procedure from a P1 procedure.]]

P2 uses P1 to add two double-digit numbers, in fact we can simply add more P1s to the design to deal with any numbers of digits. 

By now we can make the following observations:
* Whatever machine that can perform P can perform P1, P2, and etc.
* We have made procedures that perform seemingly intelligent activities by making them more complex and at the same time kept them doable by simple machines. 

If we follow the same line of reasoning, it is not hard to imagine we can create increasingly more complex procedures to instruct the simple machine to do progressively more intelligent things, such as 
* integer subtraction
* compare two integers (subtraction and check the sign of the result)
* integer multiplication (repeated addition)
* represent fractions using a pair of integers and do arithmetic on them
* use matrices of integers to represent systems of equations and solve them using matrix operations
* use systems of equations to model complex physical systems and perform numerical simulations of these systems

In summary, from this example we can see that simple symbolic operations can be assembled to form lager procedures to perform amazing activities through computational processes. Such activities are not limited to numerical calculations. If we can represent abstract ideas as symbols (as we represent abstract quantities as concrete numbers) and device procedures to manipulate the symbols according to the relations among the ideas we can model reasoning as computational processes. This is what computer science is fundamentally about - information processes with two essential components: representations and a sequence of rules for manipulation of the representations. Note that it has nothing to do with electronics or physics. The machine that carries out such processes does not need to know the meaning of the symbols and why the process yields correct results. The machine only needs to follow the procedures (a set of rules) blindly.

As an example, you can read about a mechanical computer ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine difference engine]) designed by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage Charles Babbage] that can tabulate polynomial functions: 

[[File:Babbage_Difference_Engine_(Being_utilised).jpg|600px|A difference engine: computing the solution to a polynomial function]]

====Another Analogy====
[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Feynman&amp;oldid=613571721 Richard Feynman] used another similar analogy (file clerk) to explain how computers work from the inside out in his Computer Heuristics Lecture (1 hour 15 mins):
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKWGGDXe5MA

====History====
Now that we have learned computing is, in essence, a certain manipulation of symbols. A computer's ability to perform amazing tasks depends on its ability to manipulate symbols according to well defined rules. In fact, digital computers only manipulate two symbols - zeros and ones. The intelligence of computing lies in the design and implementations of the rules/programs. 

In the future, when talk about computer machinery we will see computers are constructed using such principles. 

You may wonder where the ideas come from. Many people in history made significant contributions to ideas of computing and computers. Gottfried Leibniz (1646-1716), a German philosopher, is considered the first person to dream of reducing reasoning to calculation and building a machine capable of carrying out such calculations. His observed that in arithmetic we represent abstract quantities using symbols and manipulate the symbols to get useful results according to rules. He dreamed that  we could represent abstract ideas using symbols and reason with the ideas according to the logics between the ideas via similar concrete symbol manipulation as we do in arithmetic. Such manipulations give use correct results not because whoever does the manipulation is intelligent but because the rules of manipulation mirrors relationships between quantities and logics between ideas.    

Because of Leibniz’s dream, now we have computer science and universal machines called computers. A computer is fundamentally a physical device that can manipulate symbols following very simple logic rules. Almost all computers are electronic because it happens to be cheaper and easier to build that way. Computer science is fundamentally about the information process (dealing with abstract ideas) that takes place through symbol manipulation, which follows a recipe (a set of rules). Such recipes are also known as algorithms. No wonder so many computer programming books are called cookbooks :) In computer science we study how to represent information and how to design and apply algorithms to get meaningful results. There are usually many ways to perform the same task. Comparing algorithms for evaluation purposes is called algorithm (complexity) analysis. Communicating an algorithm (recipe) to a computer is called programming/software development. The languages we use for such communication are called computer programming languages. The artifacts of programming are computer programs or software. The engineering disciplines we try to apply in the software development process to produce quality software is called software engineering. So computer science is more about problem solving than computers. Computing science is probably a more appropriate name for this discipline.

===Practices of Computing===
Principles are fundamental ideas that permeate all aspects of computing. Practices are not principles but are very useful to identify because they identify the central practices of computing professionals. Practices, sometimes called &quot;know-hows&quot;, define someone's skill set and the level of competency: beginner, competent, and expert. The four core practices of computing are identified in the Great Principles of Computing project&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Denning|Denning, Peter]], The Great Principles of Computing, http://denninginstitute.com/pjd/GP/GP-site/welcome.html
&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Programming (including multilingual programming practice)
* Systems and systems thinking
* Modeling, validating, testing, and measuring
* Innovating

Programming an integral part of computer science because it allows us to explore abstract ideas in computer science in concrete ways. It is also an exciting creative process, which brings a great deal of satisfaction when we can make computers do useful things. In this course we will program in a very high-level graphical programming environment to explore ideas in computer science.

Donald Knuth regards programming like composition: well-written programs are a pleasure for others or yourself to read. He believes that  programming is triply rewarding :
* beautiful code (aesthetic)
* do useful work (humanitarian)
* get paid (economic)

Programming a computer is essentially teaching the computer how to do things. As we mentioned previously computers are simple machines that strictly follow orders. For a computer to do the right task the instructions in our program must be correct and logical. Programs that are executable on a computer are software - serving as the brain of the computer. Software with errors is called buggy (see for the history of this name) software. Testing software on an actual computer can help catch most bugs in the software. Testing provides almost immediate feedback to the quality of our programs so that we can fix bugs and improve it. Because this we believe programming makes us better thinkers and learners. We will see why it is hard to proof the correctness of programs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Have you ever wondered what computing is and how a computer works? To most people computing is magical. The world we live in increasingly relies on computers or computing to function. There seems no limit to what computers can do. 

Do you find the terms, such as computing, computers, and computer science, confusing? The concepts of computing and computers are abstract because they are man-made and artificial - new and unfamiliar to us. If we attempt to understand the concepts by studying the technologies that result from research in computing and computers, it can be overwhelming as technologies can be very complicated and constantly changing.  Another approach is to try to strip away all unnecessary complexity and focus on the fundamental ideas and underlying principles. Because they are fundamental they should help develop a deeper understanding of discipline, for instance, we study general biology to get a big picture of biology. Because the ideas are big and powerful and they demonstrate the beauty of computing. Such big ideas are also widely applicable in many other fields so anyone can benefit from studying them. 

Due to the abstract nature of the material we will use lots of analogies and metaphors to illustrate concepts to draw new concepts into our frame of understanding. 

In this book we will try to unpack and illustrate big ideas, such as the nature of computing, representations of information, algorithms, abstraction, recursion, and computability, and use modern technologies to .</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Information Representation==
Computing is fundamentally about information processes. Each computation is a certain manipulation of symbols, which can be done purely mechanically (blindly). If we can represent information using symbols and know how to process the symbols and interpret the results properly we can get valuable new information. In this section we will study information representation in computing. 

Google published its [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdgQpa1pUUE self-driving car video] on March 28 2012 to showcase its technology in building autonomous cars. As of today (June 30 2014) this video has viewed morn than 6 million times. To enable a machine to drive itself what kinds of information does the machine needs to know? A huge amount of information needs to be collected and processed in real-time. 

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information Information] is conveyed as the content of messages, when interpreted/perceived by our senses it causes certain mental response. Information is always encoded into various forms for transmission and interpretation. We deal with information all the time. For example, we receive information when we read a book, listen to a story, watch a movie, or dream a dream. We give information when we write an email, draw a picture, act in a show or give a speech. Information is abstract but it is conveyed through concrete media. For instance, a conversation on the phone communicates information but the information is represented by sound waves, electronic signals and etc. along the way. 

Information is abstract/virtual and the media that carry the information must be concrete/physical. Therefore before any information can be processed or communicated it must be quantified/digitalized - a process that turn information into (data) representations using symbols. 

===Information theory===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon Claude E. Shannon] is considered the father of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory information theory] because he is the first person who studied and built mathematical models for information and communication of information. He also made many other significant contributions to computing. His seminal paper “A mathematical theory of communication” (1948) changed our view of information laying the foundation for the information age. Shannon discovered that the fundamental unit of information is a yes or no answer to a question or one bit with two distinct states, which can be represented by only two symbols. He also founded the design theory of digital computer/circuit by proving that propositions of Boolean algebra can be used to build a &quot;logic machine&quot; capable of carrying out general computation (manipulation of two types of symbols).

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data Data], another term closely related to information, is an abstract concept of representations of information. We will use information representations and data interchangeably. 

===How information is represented?===
Information can be represented on different levels. It is helpful to separate information representations into two categories: external representation and internal representation. The external representation is used for communication between human and computers, but internally all information is stored and processed using a more unified representation.

====External representation====
We are familiar with external representations of information by computers. Everything we see on a computer (monitor) screen, whether it is text, image, or motion picture, is a representation of certain information. Computers also represent information externally using sound and other media, such as touch pad for the blind to read text.     

====Internal (binary) representation====
Internally all modern computers represent information as bits. We can think of a bit as a digit with two possible values. Since a bit is the fundamental unit of information it is sufficient to represent all information. It is also the simplest representation because only two symbols are needed to represent two distinct values.  This makes it easy to represent bits physically - any device capable of having two distinct states works, e.g. a toggle switch. We will see later that modern computer processors are made up of tiny switches - transistors. 

When bits are put together into sequences they can represent numbers. We are familiar with representing quantities with numbers. Numbers are concrete symbols representing abstract quantities. With ten fingers humans conveniently adopted the base ten (decimal) numbering system, which requires ten different symbols, for instance the arabic numerals uses 0 through 9. Each symbol represents a power of ten depending on the position the symbol is in. For instance 123 in decimal reprints one one hundred (&lt;math&gt;10^2&lt;/math&gt;), two tens (&lt;math&gt;10^1&lt;/math&gt;), and three ones (&lt;math&gt;10^0&lt;/math&gt;). This base ten system used for numbering is somewhat arbitrary. In fact we commonly use other base systems to represent quantities of different nature: base 7 for drays in a week, base 60 for minutes in an hour, 24 for hours in a day, 16 for ounces in a pound, and etc. It is not hard to imagine base 2 (two symbols) is the simplest base system because with less than two symbols we can not represent change therefore no information. 

Lets see how we can use base 2 system to represent numbers. All base systems work in the same way - the right most digit represent quantity of the base raised to the zeroth power (always 1), and each digit to the left represents a quantity that is base times larger than the one represented by the digit immediately to the right. The binary number 1001 represents the quantity 9 (in decimal) because the one to the left represents &lt;math&gt;2^3=8&lt;/math&gt;, the one to the right represents &lt;math&gt;2^0=1&lt;/math&gt;, and the two zeros represents nothing because zero times any quantity is zero. When we use different base systems it is necessary indicate the base as the subscript to avoid confusion, for example it becomes clear that &lt;math&gt;1001_2&lt;/math&gt; represent the quantity 9 (in decimal) not a thousand and one (in decimal). This example also shows us that representations have no intrinsic meaning. The same pattern of symbols, e.g. 1001, can represent different quantities depending on the way it is interpreted. There are many other ways to represent the quantity &lt;math&gt;9_{10}&lt;/math&gt;, for instance the following symbol &amp;#20061; represents the same quantity in Chinese.  

The computer science unplugged organization produced an [http://csunplugged.org/sites/default/files/activity_pdfs_full/unplugged-01-binary_numbers.pdf class activity] to demonstrate the idea of binary numbers using a deck of cards. 

As the same quantity can be represented by different representations we can often change the representation without changing the quantity it represents. As shown before, the binary representation &lt;math&gt;1001_2&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the decimal representation &lt;math&gt;9_{10}&lt;/math&gt; - representing exactly the same quantity. In studying computing we often need to convert between decimal representation, which we are most familiar with, and binary representation, which is used internal by computers.

Converting the binary representation of a non-negative integer to its decimal representation is straight-forward process - summing up the quantities each binary digit represents yields the result. 

&lt;math&gt;1001_2=1*2^3+0*2^2+0*2^1+1*2^0=8+0+0+1=9_{10}&lt;/math&gt; 

To reverse the process we can use a method called repeated division as illustrated in the following chart, in which &lt;math&gt;23_{10}&lt;/math&gt; is converted to its binary representation&lt;math&gt;10111&lt;/math&gt; by dividing 23 by 2, writing down the remainder in the third column, and repeating the same process on the quotient till it becomes zero. The result binary representation is remainders written down in the reverse order (last remainder first).   

[[File:Decimaltobinary.pdf|thumb|Decimaltobinary]]

Here is a tutorial with detailed steps http://www.wikihow.com/Convert-from-Decimal-to-Binary. 

You may wonder how we can convert fractional numbers between their decimal and binary representations. Here is a video tutorial on how to do that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jwF8CyLj8k.

In addition to numbers bits are used internally to represent many other types of information or external representations of information. We study the following examples: text, image, video, and audio.

A piece of text can be viewed as a stream of symbols can be represented/encoded as a sequence of bits resulting in a stream of bits for the text. Two common encoding schemes are [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII ASCII] code and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode Unicode]. ASCII code use one byte (8 bits) to represent each symbol and can represent up to 256 (&lt;math&gt;2^8=256&lt;/math&gt;) different symbols, which includes the English alphabet (in both lower and upper cases) and other commonly used symbols. Unicode extends ASCII code to represent a much larger number of symbols using multiple bytes. Unicode can represent any symbol from any written language and much more. 
 
A perceived image is the result of light beams physically coming into our eyes and triggering nerves to send signals to our brain. In computing an image is simulated by a rectangular grid of dots (pixels - picture element), each of which has a particular color. This works because our eyes can not tell the difference if the resolution (number of dots used) is high enough. In fact, the text you see on a computer , whose value (an integer) can be encoded as bits. In fact, the computer screen use such a grid of pixels to display images and text, each symbol of which is also represented by a grid of pixels externally but internally each symbol is represented as an ASCII or Unicode code. In addition the encoding of an image includes other meta data, such as the size of the image, the encoding standard, and the date time when it is created. Here is an [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFcaL98O8Ng demo video] showing a particular encoding format called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PPM PPM].

It is not hard to imagine that videos can be encoded as series of image frames with synchronized audio tracks also encoded using bits. The process of turning audios or sounds into bits is called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio digitalization].

===Limits of representations===
All representations are limited in multiple ways. First, the number of different things we can represent is limited because the number combinations of symbols we can use is always limited by the physical space available. For instance, if you were to represent a decimal number by writing it down on a piece of paper the size of the paper and the size of the font limit how many digits you can put down. Similarly in a computer the number of bits can be stored physically is also limited. With three binary digits we can generate &lt;math&gt;2^3=8&lt;/math&gt; different representations/patterns, namely &lt;math&gt;000_2, 001_2, 010_2, 011_2, 100_2, 101_2, 110_2, 111_2&lt;/math&gt;, which conventionally represent 0 through 7 respectively but it doesn't have to be the case. Keep in mind representations do not have intrinsic meanings. So three bits can possibly represent seven different things. With n bits we can represent &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; different things because each bit can be either one or zero and &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; are the total combinations we can get, which limits the amount of information we can represent. This concept is very useful because computers internally use binary to count and represent sizes. The following are commonly used units in computing. Note that they are all powers of twos because they are limited by the number bits available for the counting (representing the counts):       


&lt;math&gt;K(killo)=2^{10}=1024 \approx 1,000&lt;/math&gt; one thousand

&lt;math&gt;M(mega)=2^{20}=K \times 1024 \approx 1,000,000&lt;/math&gt; one million

&lt;math&gt;G(giga)=2^{30}=M \times 1024 \approx 1,000,000,000&lt;/math&gt; one billion

&lt;math&gt;T(tera)=2^{40}=G \times 1024 \approx 1,000,000,000,000&lt;/math&gt; one trillion (one million million)

&lt;math&gt;P(peta)=2^{50}=T \times 1024 \approx 1,000,000,000,000,000&lt;/math&gt; one quadrillion (one million billion)

&lt;math&gt;E(exa)=2^{60}=P \times 1024 \approx 1,000,000,000,000,000,000&lt;/math&gt; quintillion (one billion billion)

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte Unit Symbols]

Another type of limit is due to the natures of the representations. For example, one third can never be represented precisely by a decimal format with a fractional part because there will be an infinite number of threes after the decimal point. Similarly, one third can not be represented precisely in binary format either. In other words, it is impossible to represent one third as the sum of a finite list of power of twos. However, in a base-three numbering system one third can be represented precisely as: &lt;math&gt;0.1_3&lt;/math&gt; because the one after the point represent a power of three - &lt;math&gt;3^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. 

The following video demonstrates how limits in the binary representation can cause numerical errors in computing precisely because computers use binary representation internally: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BA1B56IHUTE This is a limit that is hard to overcome completely but there are practical means to deal with such [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-off_error round-off error] so that the computational results are still useful.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Algorithms and Programs==

An [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm algorithm] can be defined as a set of steps used to solve a specific problem. For example, a cook may use a recipe when preparing a specific type of food. Similarly, in computer science, algorithms are the conceptual solutions used to create programs. It is important to distinguish an algorithm from a program. The implementation of an algorithm is known as a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program program].

===Defining information processes===

Computer is about information processes. Once information is represented concretely using different patterns of symbols it can be processed to derive new information. We learned that computers use the binary system internally to represent everything as sequence of bits - zeros and ones. [http://www.bitsbook.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/12/chapter1.pdf Chapter 1 of the Blown to Bits book] talks about the digital explosion of bits as the result of the innovations in computing and technologies, which enable us to turn information into bits and shared them with unprecedented speed. 

Creating information processes is the topic of this chapter. We will learn that information processes start with conceptual solutions to problems and then can be implemented (coded) in ways understandable to machines. The conceptual solutions are called algorithms and the executable implementations are called programs. 

===What is an algorithm?===

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm Algorithm] is a rather fancy name for a simple idea: a step-by-step solution to a problem. Avi Wigderson once said algorithm is a common language for nature, human, and computer. The idea has been around for a long time. You are already familiar with many algorithms, such as tying your shoes, making coffee, send an email, and cooking a dish according to a recipe. Algorithms in computing are designed for computers to follow. Imagine we have built a machine that can perform the single digit addition procedure described in chapter one. Recall the procedure performs the addition using simple table lookup. If we give the machine two digits and ask it to perform the operation, it gives two digits back as the answer. Of course the numbers in the inputs and the output have to be represented (encoded) properly. Even though the machine doesn't understand addition is should be able to perform the addition correctly. However, the machine will not perform the addition unless it is instructed to do so. The command (with input values) that signals the machine to perform an addition is called an instruction. We have imagined that it is not hard to use the addition procedure to create other more complex procedures that can perform more impressive activities. Before we can create such procedures we must identify a problem and find a conceptual solution to it. Often time the conceptual solution is one that can be carried out manually by a person. This conceptual solution is an algorithm.

===Why study algorithms?===

Algorithm is a center piece in the computer science discipline. As we discussed in chapter one, computing can be done blindly or purely mechanically be a simple device. The intelligence of any computation (information process) lies in the algorithm that defines it. 

For an algorithm to be useful, it must be correct - the steps must be logical and specific for machines to carry out - and efficient - it must finish in a reasonable amount of time. The correctness and efficiency of algorithms are two key issues in the study of algorithms.

===Programs are implemented algorithms===

Studying algorithms allows us to solve problems conceptually regardless of the machines that carry out the solutions. An algorithm must communicate a conceptual solution in a unambiguous and human understandable fashion. A notational system for describing algorithms should allow us to describe and reason with ideas on paper. Once an algorithm's correctness is verified on paper, it can be implemented as a program understandable to a particular machine.     

===Formal definition of algorithm===

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing Alan Turning] is the first person who studied algorithms mathematically by creating a universal machine model, later called Turing machine. He also proved that computation is unavoidable in circumstances - we will have to perform the computation to the result, which separates computing from mathematics (the birth of computer science). The turing machine can represent/encode information in a standard form and interpret and updates the representation according to rules (algorithms), which is part of the representation. This machine model is simple yet powerful. In fact, it is the most powerful computing model known to computer scientist. The turing machine can perform any computation done by any machine we could ever build. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine_equivalents Turing machine equivalents] is defined based on this idea.

The turning machine model allows us to study algorithms in abstraction. For instance, we can view each algorithm as a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine state machine]: an algorithm always starts with a state - represented by a data representation of the input and the internal information - and move through a number of states to its final state as the result of performing operations prescribed in the algorithm. When the number of possible initial states approach infinity the same algorithm can generate potentially infinite number of computation. This explains why it is hard to verify the correctness of an algorithm through testing as the initial states can be too many to exhaustively enumerate.

===Define algorithms===

An algorithm is simply a set of steps that allow us to solve a particular problem. A step is a unit of work that is unambiguous and can be done in a fixed amount of time. For example bring a pot of water to boil is a step in the tea-making process/algorithm. In computing we deal with representations of information (data), so a step can be adding two integers and storing the result to a variable. We will explain how to define and use variables later.

The definition of a unit of work depends on what the agent, who performs work, can do. Algorithms in computing are necessarily informed by the capability of the computing machines. Recall that algorithms must be implemented/described in a programming language understandable to a machine before the machine can perform the task. There are many different programming languages, therefore different ways to express the same algorithm. The only language understandable to a specific machine is called the machine language. Machine languages are written in instructions consisting of zeros and ones (binary bits) because computers are fundamentally machines that can manipulate two types of symbols. Each different type of machine is designed to understand its own native language -- patterns of zeros and ones -- because they can be very different [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware computing hardware]. As you can imagine writing programs in machine languages can be very hard. Normally we write programs to express our algorithms in high level languages - languages that are close to our natural language, e.g. English. Then we use tools (compilers and interpreters) to translate our programs in higher level languages to machine languages, which is analogous to using a personal interpreter when we travel abroad and don't understand the native language. To run the same program on a different machine we can simply recompile it or user a different interpreter. High level languages hides the differences between machines to allow us to write programs in a machine independent way, which is a huge time saver. When we write programs in high level languages we use an abstraction that is supported by all computers. For instance if a high level language allows the expression of an addition we assume it can be done by all computers.

Programming languages (high level or machine level) are tools for expressing algorithms to machines. When we create algorithms to solve problems conceptually we want to create them independent of the languages. A well-designed recipe ought to work for different cooks in different kitchens. So the steps or units of work must be defined in terms of a higher abstraction - a set of common data structure,  operations and control structures that all languages support. By creating algorithms conceptually using abstractions allows us humans to think on a higher level closer to the problem domain we know. When a algorithm is implemented in a particular language the abstract steps can be mapped to the specific expression in the language. We are confident the chain of tools we have can translate the solution to the machine level executable code. The following diagram shows that the same algorithm can be implemented in a variety of programming languages and the result programs can be executed on different machine models (maybe after some translation).

[[File:Algorithms v.s. Programming Languages.jpg|thumb|This diagram shows that the same algorithm can be implemented in a variety of programming language and then result programs can be run on different machine models.]]            

Here are the common operations and control structures we can assume all high level languages support:
*data structures: variables of single value and list of values.
*operations: arithmetic operations, comparisons, and relational operations (and, or, and not)
*control structures: sequential (one after another), conditional (selective on a condition), and repetition

Here is an algorithm define in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudocode psedo code] (natural language).
This algorithm finds the largest number in a list of numbers with the following steps:
# set max (a variable) to the value of the first number in the list (store and retrieve values).
# go through the list one number at a time comparing each number to max, if the number is greater than max replace max with the number (conditional and repetition).
# the value stored in max is the answer. 

We know the solution is correct because it is so simple. We know how to carry it out manually, but we would certainly not solve the problem using the process expressed in psedo code. It is necessary to design and express the algorithm in this detailed fashion for computers. Keep in mind that computers are machines that perform computation mechanically and therefore the instructions must be specific. The psedo code, even though in natural language, must use the aforementioned constructs (data structures, operations, and control structures) that are common to computers. You may wonder why we can not ask the computer to look at the whole list and identify the largest number as we humans do. Computers are simple machines that can not think. They are designed to perform simple operations, e.g. adding two digits via symbol manipulation. Even we, as human beings, will not be able to scan a long list, say a million numbers, and find the largest number at a glance. The algorithm we write must be expressed in terms of what a computer can do and are scalable to inputs (data sets) of arbitrary sizes. The algorithm we just studied can deal with a list of any size. In fact, it makes little difference to a computer whether the list has three numbers or three million numbers.

Another way to express the same algorithm is to use a graphical notation called flow-chart. [[File:Find max number in a list of numbers.jpg|thumb|This flow-chart shows the steps involved in finding the largest number in a list of numbers.]]
This chart shows the logic of the solution more clearly. There are two conditionals - the checking of a condition and corresponding actions taken as the result. The top-most conditional defines a repetition (loop) because their an unconditional branching back to the conditional as expressed in the arrow with no label.

Both the pseudo code and the flow chart describe the same solution to the same problem. They are different representations of the same idea. The following figure shows an implementation of the algorithm in Scratch. 
[[File:Find the largest number in a list of number using scratch.jpg|thumb|This stack of blocks scratch finds the largest number in a list of numbers.]] 
As you can see, a concrete implementation of an algorithm must use the building &quot;blocks&quot; available in the particular implementation language. What is not shown in the figure is the part where the list is populated with data from a file or user input. The structure of the code resembles that of the flow-chart.

In summary constructing and studying algorithms allows us to study (algorithmic) solution to problems in a language and computing environment neutral way. We could use the &quot;finding largest number&quot; algorithm as a single block to form more complex algorithms, but we need to keep in mind this block is not a unit of work as the number of steps involved depends on the input size (the length of the list). We will revisit this topic in the future when we talk about functional decomposition (to keep algorithms simple) and algorithm complexity analysis (count the cost of algorithms).  


     
Programs
Each software program boils down to two components - data (structure) and algorithm. We will study some fundamental algorithms and data structures in computer science.

===Example algorithms===
====Image enconding/representation==== 
Follow this [http://csunplugged.org/image-representation
http://csunplugged.org/sites/default/files/activity_pdfs_full/unplugged-02-image_representation.pdf image representation activity] to see how images are encoded, transmitted, and reproduced in fax machines.

====Error detection====
Follow this [http://csunplugged.org/error-detection
http://csunplugged.org/sites/default/files/activity_pdfs_full/unplugged-04-error_detection.pdf error detection activity] to see the algorithm works to detect and also correct single bit errors.

A similar algorithm, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm Luhn algorithm], is used to validate credit card numbers.

====Text compression====
[http://csunplugged.org/text-compression Text compression] is another important task in computing. The following activity demonstrates how a compression algorithm works: 
http://csunplugged.org/sites/default/files/activity_pdfs_full/unplugged-03-text_compression.pdf

====Searching====

Why is searching important? We do it on a daily basis. It is good business too. Google's mission is to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful. Obviously to be able to find the information we need fast is very useful and profitable. 

We can always find a piece of information by going through a list of them sequentially checking each one of them. Could you describe the algorithm using either the pseudo code or the flow-chart notation? Structure-wise this algorithm should resemble the &quot;find largest number&quot; algorithm. This algorithm needs two inputs: the list and the target item we are looking for. The repeated steps are fetching the next item and comparing it to target. The piece of information used in the comparison is also known as the key because it determines whether a search is successful or not. For instance, if we have a list of students we can search a student by last name, birthdate, or shoe size, which are search keys.  

A sequential search is straight-forward, but it can be costly if we need to perform it very often. However, if the list is ordered by the search key we can use a much better algorithm by taking advantage of this ordered property of the data. Think about the index of a book, a phone book, or a dictionary. They are all ordered somehow. For instance, home phone numbers in a phone books are usually ordered by owner's last names and business phone numbers are ordered by business types. Entries in a dictionary or the index of a book are ordered alphabetically. How does this orderedness help us when we search for information? It allows us to guesstimate where the search target is located. The [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm#Number_guessing_game number guessing game] illustrate the idea well. If the list of numbers are random but ordered increasingly we can always guess the target number is in the middle of the search range (initially the whole list). If we are not lucky, we can eliminate half of the candidates - if the number in the middle is greater than the search target the new search range will be the first half of the previous search range, otherwise the second half. Imagine the reduction in the number of comparisons! We will study this algorithm in much detail when we discuss algorithm complexities.

===Social impact===

Please watch the following video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENWVRcMGDoU How algorithms shape our world]. Could you explain in what ways algorithms are shaping our world?

In the world of computing, we store and process data (representations of information) by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantification quantifying] information. This quantification process reduces the world to what can be counted and measured and emphasize abstraction and efficiency (speed). We must not be fooled to believe the abstractions of reality are true reality as in [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstractionism abstractionism]. As Frederick Brooks warns us “Models are intentional oversimplifications to help us with real-life problems that are frighteningly complicated. The map is not the terrain.”</text>

One powerful example of algorithm design can be seen when solving a Rubik's cube. When solving a Rubik's cube (of any size), it is important to know the step by step instructions or algorithm to reach an efficient solution. This is where algorithm design comes into place. There are designs that breakdown the seemingly complex solution by addressing each layer (First, Middle, and Last and colors.

===Approaches to algorithm design:===

====Top Down====

The top down approach to design is starting by examining the full problem or one way to think of it is to look at the big/whole picture first. Once you have assessed the main problem then you divide the problem into smaller components or parts. 

The next portion of the top down approach is to begin testing. Initially, we will have portions that are missing due to focusing on the bigger picture. In situations where parts of the problem have not been solved stubs or placeholders are used to as temporary holders. 

One way to think about the top down approach is in a hierarchical setting such as a general command his troops. The general will breakdown a mission by assigning each soldier with a specific task to complete that in turn contributes to a critical part of the overall mission.

====Bottom Down====

The bottom down approach to algorithm design starts with the smallest units or parts of a problem. This approach solves the smallest units first and then gradually builds out the next layer or solution. Using this method ensures that the smallest unit has been successfully tested and therefore, when you start solving or implementing the next sub-solution that it will work due to the previous layers working successfully. 

One example is building a car. Each piece of the car is engineered, created, and tested piece by piece. Knowing that the smaller parts work correctly the parts are then gradually added on an assembly line. As the parts are added, you know that the smaller components work due to thoroughly testing each piece. Eventually, as you walk through this process the end result is a properly functioning car.

===Algorithm Design: Building Blocks===

There are basic logic structures and operations involved in algorithm design. Building blocks are necessary to decide how we want to manipulate units of work. The basis of every algorithm is steps or blocks of operations. These steps/blocks of operation can be as simple as adding two numbers together. However, these blocks of operation can also be complex, for example, finding the maximum value in a list of numbers. 

Logic structures in important for organizing steps into a process/solution. The following four basic logic structures describe the type of blocks used for creating algorithms: 
*procedure/function call - one example would be a single block in Scratch
*sequence - in order to create a sequence you need a stack of blocks 
*alternatives - use of the if-then-else blocks to indicate alternate solutions for a particular problem
*iteration - using the &quot;repeat&quot;, &quot;for&quot;, and &quot;forever&quot; blocks to build loops to solve problems

Most languages have programming constructs for basic operations and logic structures. In order to understand programming constructs you must first learn about [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructed_language constructed language]. According to Wikipedia, a constructed language &quot;is a language whose phonology, grammar, and vocabulary has been consciously devised for human or human-like communication, instead of having developed naturally&quot;. Similarly, a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language programming construct] is &quot;designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer.&quot;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Algorithm Complexity==

&quot;An algorithm is an abstract recipe, prescribing a process that might be carried out by a human, by computer, or by other means. It thus represents a very general concept, with numerous applications.&quot; -- David Harel, &quot;Algorithmics - the spirit of computing&quot;.

We have learned that algorithms are conceptual solutions to problems. Computing algorithms can be described/defined in terms of the common units of work that computers can do so that they are neutral to programming languages and the execution environment (computers). Algorithm writing is such a creative process as Francis Sullivan noted that &quot;for me, great algorithms are the poetry of computing. Just like verse, they can be terse, allusive, dense, and even mysterious. But once unlocked, they cast a brilliant new light on some aspects of computing.&quot; You have seen example algorithms documented using abstract notations such as pseudo code and flowchart. 

Once algorithms are implemented/coded, i.e. represented by concrete symbols, they become alive in program that embody them. Programs are executable/runnable by computers. The ability to run different programs that implements all kinds algorithms is a unique feature of computers as machines. Usually when we buy a machine, e.g. an appliance, we assume it has a set of well defined functions it can perform. For example a microwave oven is supposed to warm and cook our food and nothing more. We don't expect a microwave oven ever to be able to wash the clothes for us. A computing machine (a computer) is different. We expect it to perform the function whichever program makes it to do - the functionality of a computer is extensible. If we liken a computer to a car, programmers are drivers who can make the car do different things (to a certain extent) and users are like passengers taking advantage of the things the car can do. This is another reason why everyone needs to learn computer programming because it gives you the freedom to make the computer do different thing. 

===Correctness of Algorithms===

Algorithms must be correct to be useful. We must examine our algorithms carefully to remove errors before using them to create programs. If an algorithm has errors, it is impossible to create correct programs. We often remind students that if their algorithms do not work on paper they won't work on a computer. So we must work out our algorithms on paper first. 

Even if the design of an algorithm is correct we may introduce errors during the programming process. As any natural language a programming language has its own syntax consisting of grammatical rules for using the language. When we violate such rules we introduce syntax errors in our program. This type of errors are easy to fix, in fact most modern program editors can detect and warn us about such errors. Another type of errors are logic errors, which result from the misuse of the language. In other words, our grammatically correct program doesn't make sense or make the wrong sense to the computer. For example, a recipe can be unclear or misleading even though all sentences are grammatically correct. You may think that computers can also make mistakes when running programs that are logically. This is true but very rarely this is the case especially with modern computers equipped with error detection mechanisms. We generally assume computers don't make mistakes. If the program doesn't generate the correct answer, it is the result of human errors. 

We also call logic errors [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug software bugs]. The original &quot;bug&quot; is, in fact, a hardware failure - a moth caught in a electromechanical computer. Now bugs are generally used to refer to any error/failure in computer systems, both in hardware and in software. When a computer program is buggy, it will produce erroneous results or crash as the computer may not know what to do next. Another more subtle bug may cause the computer program to never finish, known as the infinite loop, which is obviously not what we wanted.

Bugs are almost inevitable as humans make mistakes. Then, how do we fix bugs to ensure the correctness of our programs? We must test our programs to verify its correctness. A test consists of a sample input to a program and the desired output from the program. We can run a test by subject the program to the sample input and collect the actual output. If the actual output matches the desired output the program passes the test, otherwise their is a bug in the program or in the test (tests can be buggy too). We usually use a set of tests (a test suite) to exercise different parts of the algorithm. This process is called debugging as expressed in the following pseudo code: 

 for each test in the test suite
   run and compare the actual output to the desired output
   if they match move on to the next test
   otherwise fix the bug and repeat the whole process 

Note that it is very difficult to make our tests exhaustive except for very simple programs. When a program becomes larger and more complex the number of tests need to cover all possible cases grows very fast. As [https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra Dijkstra] said &quot;program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!&quot; There are techniques for proving the correctness of programs. For instance, microcode for computer processors are often proved correct via [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification formal verification].

===&quot;Goodness&quot; of algorithms===

There are usually always multiple ways to solve the same problem and, therefore, multiple algorithms to make computers solve the problem for us. In addition to solving the problem correctly we want to be able to compare/evaluate algorithms that solve the same problem. We must define the criteria/measure for &quot;goodness&quot; in algorithm design. Such criteria or measures can include simplicity, ease of implementation, speed of execution, or preciseness of answers. In computing we care the most about the solution speed because a fast algorithm can solve larger problem or more problems in the same amount of time. This is also known as efficiency - an economic measure of many processes. Often time he usefulness of many programs depends on the timeliness of the results. For instance, a program that takes 24 hours to predict the next day's weather is almost useless. 

Given an algorithm how do we measure its &quot;speed&quot;? One possible approach is to implement the algorithm, run the result program, and measure its execution time - elapsed time between the start and the end of a program run. There are some challenges in this approach. First the algorithm must be implemented, which can a serious undertaking. Secondly, to run two programs to compare their execution time we must subject them to the same input (a.k.a a workload, e.g a list of one million numbers to be sorted) and the size of the input is never ideal. Thirdly, the &quot;speed&quot; of a running program is influenced by the execution environment, such as the machine's hardware configuration. Take a recipe for example. Different cooks will surely spend different time following it. The amount of food needed will surely magnify the difference - as we increase the amount of ingredients the lengthy recipes will take even longer to follow. But there are intrinsic characteristics of the recipes that affect the preparation time. If a recipe involves beating eggs can instruct the cook to break each egg and scramble it individually or break all eggs first and scramble them together. Obviously the first method is slower due to the additional steps involved. Algorithms in computing exhibit similar characteristics. Recall that algorithms must be defined in terms of the units of work (steps) computers can perform so that it is straightforward to implement them in programming languages. The way the steps are ordered and organized in algorithms can significantly affect the execution time of the programs implement the algorithms. 

Since an algorithm is a conceptual solution to a problem, we want to study their &quot;speed&quot; in an abstract sense without actually implementing them. This is known as algorithm analysis in computer science. In this approach we take an algorithm described in pseudo code or flow chart, count the number of steps (units of work), which is always a function of the input size. In the aforementioned example recipe the time it takes to follow the first method (break each egg and scramble it individually) is directly proportional to the number of eggs involved. In fact if only one egg is needed, there is no difference between the two methods. Instead of measuring the steps taken for a particular input size, we focus on the relationship function between the number of steps and the input size, which shows the pattern in which the amount of work (cost) grows as the input size increases. Such functions are also known as growth functions. Then, we apply [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptotic_analysis asymptotic analysis], which compare functions as inputs approach infinity, to simplify the functions because as the input size approaches infinity the difference between the units of works disappears (we can assume breaking an egg and scrambling it take the same amount of time) and the cost of most &quot;complex&quot; part of the task will dominate (a part that repeats a step 10 time will dwarf any step that is only done once) the total cost. For example, in a recipe we have a one quick step (takes 0.0001 seconds per serving) that repeats 10 times and a slow step (takes 10 seconds per serving) doesn't repeat, an amount of serving of N (input size) would cost &lt;math&gt;0.0001*10*N&lt;/math&gt; total seconds on the repeated steps and would always cost 10 seconds on the slow step. When N is bigger than 10000, the repeated part would cost more than the slow part. In asymptotic analysis we can ignore the slow step because its contribution to the total cost is negligible when N approaches infinity. With simplify growth functions we can put them into categories considering algorithms in each category to have similar performance characteristics.  This type of analysis is not completely precise but it can be very useful in studying the nature of algorithms and predicting their performances. We learn how to put algorithms into categories and rank their performances according to the categories they are in. We denote each category using big O notation.  

In summary we have discussed the following few key concepts regarding algorithm complexity analysis:
* Algorithms are conceptual and abstract solutions to problems and programs are concrete executable code computers can run. We can not run algorithms on computers; we can only run programs that implement algorithms. Therefore, the performance of an algorithm is by definition abstract (can not be concretely defined or measured).  
* The goodness measure of an algorithm has to be an intrinsic characteristic of the algorithm itself - something that reflects the &quot;cleverness&quot; of the design regardless the implementation details and the future execution environments. 
* From an economic perspective we care about the cost of algorithms both in terms of time and space. We will focus only on the time cost in this course. We can not actually measure the time cost of algorithms, but we can study the relationship between the time cost and the input size, which reflects the internal complexity (or cleverness) of algorithms. We represent such relationships as growth functions with the input size as the variable and the total cost as the value. The growth functions can be simplified by keeping only the dominate term (asymptotic analysis) because other terms won't matter when the input becomes really large (eventually approaching infinity). Simplified growth functions are put into categories and algorithms can be rank by the categories they belong to. 
* Algorithms in the low complexity category will perform better than algorithms in the higher complexity categories when the input size is sufficiently large. We care about large input sizes because any algorithm can solve a small problem fast. With this algorithm analysis technique we can evaluate and compare algorithms to predict the relative performance of the programs implementing such algorithms before actually implementing any of them. 
* Efficiency, as another term often used, is reversely proportional to complexity. A more complex algorithm is less efficient because it makes less efficient uses of the computing resources by being more complex.

===Examples===

There are at least two ways to calculate the sum of all numbers between 1 and N. The following are two algorithms:
*Algorithm 1: add all the numbers up manually, one by one
*Algorithm 2: calculate the result using this formula &lt;math&gt;(N+1)*(N/2)&lt;/math&gt;

Consider the following question: if we carry out the two algorithms manually, which one would run faster if
*N = 2?
*N = 100?
*N = 1,000,000?

Lets see how a algorithms behave (after implemented) on a computer. The following script implements algorithm 1 using a block that iterates through all the numbers in the range and adding them to the sum one at a time.
[[File:Add all numbers example.png|thumb|A Snap! script that adds all the numbers between two numbers.]]
[[File:Add all numbers block.png|thumb|A Snap! reporter block that adds all the numbers between two numbers and reports the sum.]]
The same problem can be solved using algorithm 2, which use a function to calculate the result as shown in the following script and the report block.
[[File:Calculate sum all numbers block.png|thumb|A Snap! reporter block that calculate the sum of all numbers in range and reports the result.]]
[[File:Calculate sum all numbers.png|thumb|A Snap! block that calculates the sum of all numbers in a range.]]

Both scripts (programs) take the same input - two numbers that define a range. The number of numbers in the range is the input size or more properly the problem size. We assume the units of work are arithmetic operations &lt;math&gt;+-*/&lt;/math&gt;, assignment operations, and report operation. Such an assumption is reasonable because in deed those operations takes the same to to perform regardless the operands. If you run the programs and try different input size you will observe that as you increase the input size the execution time of the first program increases steadily whereas the second program shows not change in execution time. Can we predict such behaviors? 

Lets apply algorithm analysis to these two algorithms. The first algorithm loops through the numbers to get the sum, therefore the relationship function between cost (the number of steps - additions) and the input size is &lt;math&gt;f=a+b*N&lt;/math&gt; assuming N is the input size and a and b are the cost for creating the script variable and the cost for an addition. Note that both a and b are constant because they don't change for a given computer. We can simply the function to &lt;math&gt;f=N&lt;/math&gt; because when N approaches infinity the constants don't matter anymore. We assign algorithms with this type of growth function into the leaner algorithm to the leaner  this type of functions linear time category denoted by &lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt;. The second algorithm always takes the same amount of time because it performs the same set of operations regardless of the input size. It belongs to the constant time category denoted by &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;. 

Lets consider another problem: are numbers in a list distinct? Here is a straight forward algorithm in pseudo code:
*Step 1: compare the first number with all of the other numbers in the list. If, at any point, the same number is seen, stop and answer NO.
*Step 2: repeat Step 1 by taking the next number from the list and comparing it with all of the the other numbers.
*Step 3: after using all numbers in the list, stop and answer YES.

The input size is the size of the list. The more numbers in the list the longer it takes to answer the question. According to algorithm it is possible that the first comparison find two identical numbers, which answer the questions right a way. This is good design because at that point it is unnecessary to continue with the rest of the algorithm. When we analyze algorithms we focus on worst cases because the performance of an algorithm is dependent from the actual input and we should not rely on luck! So the relationship (growth) function between the cost and the input size for this algorithm should be &lt;math&gt;f=N*(N-1)&lt;/math&gt; because in the worst case (all numbers are unique) the algorithm has to compare each number to all the other numbers in the list before it arrive at the answer. To simply the function by keeping only the largest dominating term we get &lt;math&gt;f=N^2&lt;/math&gt;, which puts the algorithm in the quadratic category &lt;math&gt;O(N^2)&lt;/math&gt;. If you are interested you can reproduce and run the following script (an implementation of the algorithm) to verify the predicted performance characteristics of the algorithm. 
[[File:Are numbers in a list unique block.png|thumb|A Snap! reporter block that tests whether all the numbers in a list are unique.]]
[[File:Are numbers in a list unique.png|thumb|A Snap! script that tests whether all the numbers in a list are unique.]] 

Lets look at an algorithm from another category: print all n-digit numbers?

 For each number in 0, 1, 2, 3, ..., 9 
  use the number for the first digit
  enumerate all n-1 digit numbers
  append each every n-1 digit number to the first digit to form a n digit number

This example is a little contrived but it demonstrate a new performance category and is very useful when we discuss encryption techniques. The algorithm is complex simply because the amount of output (all n digit numbers) it has to generate. So the cost of the output part will dominate the total cost. To generate all n digit numbers we must first generate all n-1 digit numbers. To generate all n-1 digit numbers we must first generate all n-2 digit numbers and so on. It is easier to study the process backward. Assuming outputting a number is the unit of work (it takes the same time output a number) the cost to generate all one digit numbers is 10. To generate all two digit numbers we have to output &lt;math&gt;10*10=10^2&lt;/math&gt; numbers. For three digit numbers the cost is &lt;math&gt;10^3&lt;/math&gt;. Did you see a pattern? To generate all n digit numbers it costs &lt;math&gt;10^n&lt;/math&gt;. This type of algorithms goes much faster than the quadratic ones because the input size is in the exponent. They belong to the exponential time category denoted as &lt;math&gt;O(2^N)&lt;/math&gt;. The root (in this case 2) doesn't matter. Because all exponential functions are more similar to each other than quadratic functions or linear functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Abstraction and Recursion==
Programming is easy as long as the programs are small. Inevitably our programs will grow larger and larger as we create them to solve increasingly complex problem. One technique we use to keep our algorithms and programs simple is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstraction abstraction], which is an idea widely used in many fields such as art, math and engineering. In this chapter we will study how to apply this technique is algorithm design and programming.

An abstraction removes details to help us focus our attention.  For instance, a car present a set of simple controls as an interface to its drivers. As long as we know how to use the interface we can drive the car without knowing how it operates under the hood. The internal working of a car is unnecessary detail to drivers unless they are race car drivers who need this type knowledges to drive the car most efficiently. This interface hasn't change much since when the first car was made. Abstraction also generalizes concepts by extracting common features from specific examples. This car interface extracts common car features (what a driver needs to know to drive a car) from all kinds of cars. Once you learn how to drive one car you have learned how to drive all cars of the same type. This is a powerful idea. Such abstraction also gives car makers the freedom to change the internal design of a car without affecting the users. 

===Abstraction in Computing===
We have learned that algorithm design is a integral part of problem solving using computing and a first step in programming. The hardest part isn't programming/coding but the keeping track of details in large programs. There are two primary ways to keep our programs &quot;small&quot;: chunking and layering, which are two metaphors for abstraction. Chunking breaks down (decompose) functionality into smaller units and let units interact with each other through a well-defined interface. For instance, in Snap! you can implement an algorithm as a block, which then can be used anywhere in your script as long as you can call the block with a proper sequence of parameters according to the interface. Layering separates the functional units (blocks) into layers to separate concerns and simply interactions patterns to make the complexity more manageable. The following figure illustrates the idea of layering.

[[File:Simplification via layering.jpg|By organizing functional units (blocks) into layers we can simply the interactions and allow concurrent development of the layers.]] 

In the figure each layer relies on the layer below it to function and provides services to the layer above it. For example, a unit in layer one is only allowed to call units in layer 2 below it. All interactions are limited to pairs of layers that are next to each other in a stack of layers. We could replace a layer completely with a new implementation without affecting the rest of the stack, which achieves modularity. On the contrary if any arbitrary interaction is allowed we may end up with tightly coupled system as shown in the following figure.

[[File:Complicated interactions.jpg|Without any restriction any unit (block) can call any other unit.]]

===Abstraction Examples===

Using abstraction to achieve simplification and generalization is truly a powerful organizing idea. Recall the thought experiment in chapter one, in which we built a machine that can potentially solve groups of equations. The machine was built through abstraction - we construct larger building blocks using smaller (more elementary) ones and treat each block as a unit ignoring the internal details.

The Snap! environment allows us to construct programs in a similar fashion. When a block is defined it becomes a new building block (user defined). The block can be arbitrarily complex, but to use it we only need to know the interface - its name and its list of parameters. The unnecessary details are hidden from the users greatly simplifying the thinking involved in programming.

Lets look at a concrete example. In order to make a sprite to draw different equal-lateral shapes we can create a block for drawing each type of shapes such as triangles, squares, pentagons, and etc. A block in Snap! is an abstraction that hides details and represents a certain behavior/intention. The following block draws a square with a specific size. 

[[File:Draw square.png|This Snap! block draws a square with a specific size.]] To draw a triangle we can use a similar logic structure. 

[[File:Draw triangle.png|This Snap! block draws a equal-lateral triangle.]] 

The draw triangle block repeat three times to draw each side with a turn of 120 degrees. Do you know why the sprite has to turn 120 degrees to form a 60 angel between the two sides? I hope you have noticed that the same logic structure can be used to create blocks for drawing any equal-lateral shapes. Instead of creating a block for each shape we can generalize the task into one block that can draw any shapes. This block needs an additional piece of information - the number of sides. 

[[File:Draw any shape.png|The Snap! block can draw any equal-lateral shape.]] 

With the number of sides we can determines the internal angle of the shape, which is all we need to draw the shape. Please checkout this [http://www.mathsisfun.com/geometry/interior-angles-polygons.html resource] if you are not sure how to calculate the internal angle using the number of sides. This block can serve as an abstraction of the tasks of drawing equal-lateral shapes (polygons). You may have noticed the length of the sides is hard-coded (typed in as a constant not a parameter). What if we want to draw shapes of different size? We can further generalize the function of the block by adding anther parameter and use it to control the side length. 

[[File:Draw any shape with any size.png|This Snap! block draws any equal-lateral polygon of any size.]]   

Through this example, we have demonstrated defining blocks to abstract away details of a task and generalizing a solution to solve more problems.

===Recursion=== 
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion Recursion] is a pattern that is self-similar - the whole consists of smaller parts that are structurally similar to the whole. For example, a tree consist of branches that look like smaller trees. Similarly, a directory tree of a file system on a computer and an ancestry tree genealogy exhibit a similar pattern. The following figure shows a recursive tree. 

[[File:RecursiveTree.JPG|Tree created using the Logo programming language and relying heavily on recursion.]]

Self-similarity allows us to define concepts that exhibit such a pattern in a more concise and elegant way. A tree can be either a trunk with no branches or a trunk with a number of branches, each of which is a tree. This definition covers all possible tree structures. How would you describe the following picture?

 [[File:Droste.jpg|A visual form of recursion known as the Droste effect. The woman in this image holds an object that contains a smaller image of her holding an identical object, which in turn contains a smaller image of herself holding an identical object, and so forth.]] 

If you were to do it by delving into finer and finer details repeatedly it never ends. Can you define the picture recursively? Another example is the definition of the factorial function in math:&lt;math&gt;1!=1&lt;/math&gt; and for all &lt;math&gt;n&gt;1 n! = n*(n-1)!&lt;/math&gt; This recursive definition not only defines factorial but also describes a way to calculate factorial. For example, 5! can be calculated from 4!, which is 4 times 3!, which is 3 time 2!, which is 2 times 1!, which is 1 by definition. 

If the problem we are solving is self-similar - solving the whole problem is a matter of solving the parts that are similar to the whole - the solution we are defining for the whole can be used to solve the subproblems(recursion). The beauty of a recursive solution is that the definition of the problem is the solution as shown in the factorial example. To design a recursive solution we practice wishful thinking - as we describe the solution to whole problem we wish it is fully defined and can be used to solve the smaller subproblems. In computer programming, this is called recursive thinking/programming. To program recursively, we describe the solution to a problem as a function/procedure/block, in which we break the bigger problems into smaller ones and use the function we defining to solve the smaller problems. If the problem is finite, eventually the smaller problems are so simple that they are directly solvable. In such cases the recursion stops. We call those cases base cases. By the time our program reaches all base cases, we would have solved the whole problem because all the subproblems are solved including the problem we start with. In any recursive function, two essential parts must exist: base cases and recursive cases. The recursive cases part breaks a bigger problem into smaller ones. The base cases stops the recursion by solving the directly solvable problems. If both parts exists and are structured properly, the algorithm (function) can solve problems of any size by asking clones of itself to solve partial problems. Recursive problem solving is a powerful idea because it simples our thinking: if you can define a problem recursively you can solve it recursively. Recursive solutions are more elegant and easy to verify, but it only lends itself to problems that can be defined recursively. 

Before we study some concrete examples we will introduce the concept of function, which makes recursive solutions more manageable. A block in Snap! is considered a function (similar to a math function) if it has the following properties:
* a function takes an arbitrary number of inputs (zero or more)
* a function always returns/reports exactly one result value
* for the same input a function always reports the same result value
* the execution of a function has no side effects to the environment
With such restrictions functions in Snap! are blocks that performance a task in isolation (in its own world) and hand off the result to be further processed. According to the definition what blocks in the following list are functions? 

[[File:List of blocks.tiff|Some blocks in this list are functions.]]

===Recursion Examples===
Consider the binary search algorithm:

 Find an item (target) in a sorted list
  if the list is empty, the target cannot be found
  consider the item in the middle, if it matches the target you are done 
  otherwise, decide which half to search next 

To search one half of the ordered list is just a smaller version/part of the overall problem so we can apply the same algorithm wishing the algorithm is fully defined. This process goes on till a list is empty or the search target is found.  

Clearly the base cases are
* if the list is empty, then the target can be found
* if target in the middle of a list, then the target is found

The recursive cases are (assume the list is sorted in ascending order)
* if the item in the middle of a list is smaller than the search target, continue searching in the second half of the list
* otherwise, continue searching in the first half of the list</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Recursion Revisited==

Recursive solutions provide another powerful way to solve self-similar problems. The example that we will examine is the binary search solution. 

===How Binary Search Works?=== 

The process for identifying a target item in a sorted list. You start with the first base case which is to directly solve whether the middle item is equal to the target. If the middle item equals the target then the search is complete and the index is reported. If the list is empty then the search reports -1 or not found. Otherwise, decide if the target is greater or less than the middle item to dictate which half of the list to search. 

Next, if the middle item is greater than the target the first half of the list is searched, else, we search the second half of the list. This is the same problem that we originally started with making this a recursive or self-similar problem. 

The image below is the binary search code implementation. The base cases and recursive cases are labeled.

[[File:Binarysearch.PNG|none|Binary search is used to find an item (target) in a sorted list. It consists of bases cases and recursive cases that make up the recursive solution.]]

===Binary Search: Abstraction Simplification===

One excellent way to simplify the binary search solution is using abstraction. The image previously shown uses a helper block called &quot;middle between&quot; which is used to find the middle index when given the first and last index of a sorted list (see below). 

[[File:Middlebetween binarysearch.PNG|none|The helper block used in a binary search to find the middle index between the first and last index given as input.]]

Another way to simplify the binary search solution is adding another level of abstraction. The helper block below shows the target and list being passed in as input into the &quot;binary search for&quot; block (see below). The actual recursive solution is implemented when the recursive search block detects the first and last index of a sorted list. The &quot;binary search for&quot; block allows users to call the recursive search without the user being required to provide the first and last indices. The user will only see the information and/or blocks necessary to start the binary search. The user will not see the recursive search or behind the scenes of the solution). 

[[File:Binarysearch abstraction2.PNG|none|The binary search helper block that adds another level of abstraction that searches for the target in a list  by calling the recursive search block.]]

===Binary Search: Tracing===

We have previously discussed simplifying our interface for the recursive search using &quot;binary search for&quot; which takes the target and a list as inputs (see example below). Then, the &quot;recursive search for&quot; is called and the first base case is immediately solved as our target, 9, is not equal to 5. Since the target 9 is greater than 5 (element at the middle index), we search the second half of the list (index 4 to index 5). The process is repeated and the list is split checking the first element at position and/or index 4. The target is greater than 7 and the recursive search is repeated again searching the second half of the list again. The base case 2 immediately solves that the target 9 is equal to 9 in the list; which located at the middle index 5.

Now, since the target has been found at index 5, the recursive search reports back to the second recursive search which in turn reports back to the first recursive search. Finally, index 5 is reported back to the user at top level of the &quot;binary search for&quot; block.

[[File:Tracing 1.PNG|none|This image shows how to trace the binary search when the target is equal to 9. Step by step the base case and recursive cases are used for reporting.]]

In the event the target is not found in a list the binary search reports -1 (see below). The same recursive search calls are made, but on the last call the start index is greater than the last index which indicates the target is not found and the end of the list has occurred. 

[[File:Tracing 2.PNG|none|This image shows how to trace the binary search when the target is not found in the sorted list. The solution reports -1 or not found if the target is not in the list.]]

===Koch Curve===

In 1904, Helge von Koch discovered the von Koch snowflake curve, &quot;a continuous curve important in the study of fractal geometry&quot; (3). The Koch curve starts with a single line segment that is 1 unit long. Then, the segment is replaced with four new segments, each one-third the length of the original, also called the generator. The process is repeated forever and creates the Koch curve. The image below shows this process for stages 0 to 2.

[[File:Kockcurve stage0 2.PNG|none|This shows the generator (stage 0) and iterations of stage 1 and 2 of the Koch curve.]]

The length of the Koch curve is infinite. The curve is another interesting implementation of recursion where it is self-similar; the curve copies itself over and over.

===Koch Snowflake===

Using the same Koch curve generator on all three sides of an equilateral triangle we see repeated iterations eventually start to look like a snowflake (please see [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koch_snowflake Koch Snowflake]). The snowflake has infinite perimeter and finite area.

Examining each stage of the Koch Snowflake a pattern is created for the number of segments per side, the length, and the total length of the curve as seen below. The number of segments per sides is increased four times the previous stage. The length of the segment is divided into equal thirds each time giving us the length of each segment. The original stage, an equilateral triangle, is why we take three times the number of segments per side divided by the length of a segment raised to the number of the stage currently being implemented. 

[[File:Koch snowflake chart.PNG|center|The Koch Snowflake pattern can be seen by tracking the different iterations.]]


===Exploration Questions===

Studying the Koch Curve and Snowflake patterns are established and show how the same process is repeated to generate each stage. We can use the recursive process to solve abstractions of the same problem. 

* What would the total length of the N-th iteration be? Look at the patterns made by the numbers both before and after simplifying.
* What do you expect the Koch Curve to look like? In other words, what would you expect to happen if you repeated this infinitely many times?
* What is the length of the Koch Curve?
* Can you estimate the area at each stage? What is the area of the final snowflake?

Reviewing the previous questions we can start to observe the behavior of the Koch Curve and Koch Snowflake.
# Based on the patterns established it is clear that the total length of the N-th iteration would be 3*(4/3)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.
# As the Koch Curve is infinitely repeated it will start to look more smooth as the lines will appear closer and closer although never touching. 
# The length of the Koch Curve is infinity (after applying the generator infinite number of times).
# The area of the final snowflake is bounded (finite).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Higher Order Functions==

higher order functions offer a more powerful ways to generalize solutions to problems by allowing blocks to take blocks as parameters and returning a block as a return value. All other functions are called first order functions. An example higher order function in math is the derivative function which takes a function as the input and produces another function (the derivative of the first function) as the output. In computer science, a  map function takes an arbitrary function and a data set (e.g. a list) and applies the function to each and every data item in the set. Another example is the reduce (or fold) function, which takes a input function and data set and produces the aggregation of all items in the data set using the function. For instance, if the input function is the addition the reduce function returns the sum of all items in the data set as the output. If the input function is multiplication, the reduce function produces the product of all items in the data set. Higher order function also allows us to create compositions of functions using existing functions on the fly. For example, given two functions &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=g(x)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=f(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c=g(b)&lt;/math&gt; we can create a function &lt;math&gt;y=fg(x)=f(g(x))&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;c=fg(a)&lt;/math&gt;.  

===Examples===
====map====
The following script uses the built in map block/function to apply the same block/function to each and every element in a list. 

[[File:Map another function to a list.png|The built in map block (function) is used to apply a block (function) to each and every element in a list.]] 

To apply a different function we simply need to find or implement the function and use it as the first parameter to the map block. The next example uses the multiplication function that takes two parameters. Snap! is smart enough to detect that and use each element of the list as both parameters when the function is applied. So the result list should contain the elements from the original list multiplied to themselves.

[[File:Map a function to a list.png|The built in map block (function) is used to apply a block (function) to each and every element in a list. Because the function passed in takes two parameters when the function is applied to a element of the list the same element is used as both parameters.]]

This map block generalized this pattern of applying the same function to multiple data items into a block. It doesn't simply programming because someone has to write this map block (check the source code to see how complicated it is), but it makes programmers happier because it keeps the thinking part simpler. As programmers we are freed from worrying about the iteration of lists so that we can focus on the function that needs to be applied to the list.

====reduce====
The following two examples use the built-in reduce function in Snap! to calculate the sum and the product of a list of numbers.
 
[[File:Reduce function1.png|This block applies the addition function to each and every item in the list to calculate the total.]]

[[File:Reduce function2.png|This block uses the built-in reduce function in Snap! to calculate the product of a list of numbers.]] 

Note that the reduce (combine with) function can take any function with two input parameters to aggregate a list of values to a single value. By using higher order functions we can create generalized solutions that can be customized to solve a larger set of problems.

====return blocks as data====
The following block demonstrates the use of blocks as data. In this block two reporter blocks are taken in as parameters, which are then used to form the report value - a new block. The new block applies the two input report blocks to some unknown input value. Note that the &quot;ring&quot; (gray frame) around the report value is very important. Whatever enclosed in the &quot;ring&quot; will be treated as data not programs. The application of the two functions will not be evaluated but will simply be returned as data without evaluation, which is what we wanted in this higher order function. 

[[File:Compose function.png|This block takes two (reporter) blocks as input parameters and reports a new block as the output. The function of the new block is the composition of the two functions represented by the two input blocks - when the new block is called it takes the input to the new block, applies the two functions (specified when the new block is created) to the input, and reports the result.]] 

To use the composed function we can call the compose function with the two input functions and use the &quot;call&quot; block to execute the composed block against an input value as shown in the following script.

[[File:Compose function call.png|The compose block is called to form a composed block (function) from the two input blocks. The composed block is then applied to the input value of 3. The result of this block call is 1+2+3=6.]]

With this &quot;compose&quot; block we define new functions by combining existing functions on the fly - when we need them. This is a powerful way of generalization we cannot achieve without using higher order functions.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Limits of Computing==
We have studied some big ideas of computing, which allows us to perform amazing tasks through information process. You might have gotten the impression that if we can quantify information and design an algorithm we can solve any problem using computing. In this chapter we will study the theory about the limits of computing. There are theoretical and practical limits on what computing can do for us.

===Turing Machine Revisited===
When we talk about the formal definition of algorithm we introduced the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine Turing machine], which is a mathematical model for computation. With this model we can study the nature of computing including what it is can possibly do. Alan Turing contributed greatly to the computability theory with his model machine. He proved that Turing machine is as powerful as any computer we can ever build ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness Turing completeness]). If we can find a problem the Turing machine cannot solve, we just proved the solution is not computable,  i.e. the problem is not solvable through computing on any computer. 

===Halting Problem===
In 1936 Alan Turing proved that a general algorithm to solve the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_problem halting problem] for all possible program-input pairs cannot exist, i.e. the halting problem is unsolvable using computing. More specifically, the halting problem is undecidable because it is the simplest type of question that answers a yes or no (decision) question: whether a program will eventually halt (stop) given an input. Obviously it is infeasible to actually run the program with the input to see whether it will halt because it may take forever if there is an infinite loop in the program. The idea is to analyze a program with given input to determine whether it will halt or not.

Alan Turing proved the halting problem is undecidable by a proof technique called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction proof by contradiction]. It would be very helpful to review some of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_by_contradiction sample proofs] on wikipedia. Another classic example is the proof of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_theorem#Euclid.27s_proof Euclid's theorem] in number theory, which asserts that there are infinitely many prime numbers. All proofs by contradiction start with an assumption that the proposition we are trying to proof is false, follow a logical sequence of valid steps, and arrive at a conclusion that is clearly false or contradicts, which is also false because a statement can be either true or false but never both.    

If we assume the halting problem is decidable/solvable we should be able to design an algorithm and implement it as a program that solve the problem for us. The program should take a program and the input to the program as a input parameters and return the answer - whether the program will halt or not on the input. Such a program may sound strange because it takes a program as input, but we have seen such programs, e.g. the higher order function blocks in Snap! takes a block (program) as input date and an [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpreter_(computing) interpreter program] takes the source code of a program as data and runs the program. Programs are data and there no intrinsic difference between the tow. The following proof shows that a program that answers the halting question cannot exist.
# Assume such a program A exists. A(P, D) -&gt; whether program P halt on input data D.
# We can create another program B that takes a program as input. Inside program B we can call program A with the given input to determine whether the input program will halt on itself as input data and if the answer is no (will not halt) we halt (return) and if the answer is yes (will halt) loop forever. 

  B(P):
    if A(P, P) = yes 
      infinite loop
    else
      return 
 
# What happens if we feed program B to itself as the input? or more simply, would program B halt on itself? There are two possible outcomes of the exercise: program B halts on itself or program B runs forever when itself is the input. The actual outcome/result depends on the outcome of program A called inside program B. If program B halts on itself, according to the design of program B it should run forever because the program A with program B as both inputs should run an infinite loop. On the other hand, if program B will not halt on itself, the output from program B with itself as input should return right away. Either way it is a contradiction.
# So far, we have made an assumption, followed a set of logically sound steps, and finally arrived at contradictions. What went wrong? The contradictions cannot be true because they are logically impossible. The steps are logically sound and the only part that could be wrong is the assumption. Therefore, the assumption cannot be true, i.e. the halting problem is not decidable. 

Here is a YouTube video illustrating the proof https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92WHN-pAFCs

===Intractable Problems===
Halting problem is hard because it is not solvable algorithmically even in principle. There are other hard problems that are solvable in principle but in practice they are close to being impossible to solve. As you can see we can categorize problems by the performance of the best known algorithms. If a problem can be solved using a fast algorithm, the problem is easy because we can use a computer to solve it fast. On the contrary if the best known algorithm we know takes a long time to solve a problem, it is hard because computers cannot solve it fast. 

Using [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity_theory algorithm complexity theory] we can put each algorithm into a particular category according to the algorithm's complexity. If the big-O notation of a category contains only polynomial terms, the problems solvable using algorithms in this category are called P problems (Polynomial time solutions exist), such as &lt;math&gt;O(1)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;log_2(N)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;O(N)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;O(N^2)&lt;/math&gt;. The P problems are the easy problems to computers. Among the problem without a polynomial time solution there are problems that if we can guess the solution it can be verified in polynomial time. For example, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_factorization_problem integer factorization] (or prime decomposition) problem has no known polynomial time solution but given an answer we can verify it very quickly by simply multiplying the factors and comparing the result to the integer. This types of problems are called NP (Non-deterministic Polynomial) problems. 

Collectively we call problems that take too long to solve intractable problems, which include problems with best algorithm in exponential time (&lt;math&gt;O(2^N)&lt;/math&gt;) or those with polynomial time solutions but the exponent is too larger, e.g. &lt;math&gt;O(N^{15})&lt;/math&gt;.

If a problem's best algorithmic solution is in the &lt;math&gt;O(2^N)&lt;/math&gt;, when &lt;math&gt;N=100&lt;/math&gt; and a computer does &lt;math&gt;10^{12}&lt;/math&gt; operations per second it would take &lt;math&gt;4 \times 10^{10}&lt;/math&gt; years (the age of the universe) to solve the problem on the computer.

===P v.s. NP===  
Obviously P is a subset of NP because NP is defined only by polynomial answer verification time and being able to solve a problem in polynomial time (P) certainly qualifies for that. Whether P is a proper subset of NP or, in other words, whether &lt;math&gt;P=NP&lt;/math&gt; remains one of the open questions in computer science. Nobody knows the answer. You can win a million dollars if you can solve it as one of the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Millennium_Prize_Problems Millennium Prize Problems].

To attack this P v.s. NP problem theoretical computer scientist have defined another category called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-complete NP-complete] problems. The relationships among the three categories are illustrated in the following figure. 

[[File:Complexity_classes.svg|Diagram of complexity classes provided that P ≠ NP. The existence of problems within NP but outside both P and NP-complete, under that assumption, was established by Ladner's theorem.[1]]]

All problems in this category are NP problems sharing one special property - ALL other NP-complete problems can be translated/reduced to each of the NP-complete problems in polynomial time. Because of the nature of NP-completeness if we can solve ANY single problem in this category we have proved all NP problems are solvable in polynomial time, i.e. &lt;math&gt;P=NP&lt;/math&gt;. We can take any NP problem, translate it to the solved NP-complete problem, and solve the problem in polynomial time. The overall time is still polynomial because polynomial + polynomial is polynomial. Thousands of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NP-complete_problems NP-complete problems] have been discovered but none of them has been solved. NP-complete problems are, in a sense, the most difficult known problems.

Most computer scientist believe &lt;math&gt;P \ne NP&lt;/math&gt; because the implications otherwise. The &quot;creative leaps&quot; will disappear because solving a problem is as easy as being able to recognize the right answer. Most encryption algorithms are computationally secure because breaking them are NP-problems - there is no known efficient polynomial time solution. If &lt;math&gt;P=NP&lt;/math&gt; then all encryptions are broken.      

There are other unsolved problems in computer science. You can find a list of such problems at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_computer_science</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Computing Machinery==
We have studied some fundamental principles of computing and seen the power of computing demonstrated in powerful technologies that operate on these principles. At the beginning we imagined that computing can be done purely mechanically and blindly through symbol manipulation if we can build a simple device that is capable of some simple tasks. In this lesson we will study the history of the development of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer computers] and the principles on which all modern computer hardware operate. We will see on the physical layer a computer is nothing but a simple device that follows simple rules to manipulate two symbols. 

===Computer Hardware===
Computer hardware that can carry out computation automatically has been around for too long. There is a short history from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_computing_hardware#Early_computer_characteristics early computers] to modern computers we have today.

====Mechanical Computers====
Charles Babbage invented the concept of a programmable computer and designed the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century. His [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Difference_engine difference engine] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytical_Engine analytical engine] are mechanical devices designed to tabulate polynomial functions. The input to the machines are programs and data on punched cards and the output number can be pouched onto cards or directed to a printer, a curve plotter and a bell. The machines use ordinary base-10 fixed-point arithmetic. Charles Babbage's engine is the first design for a general-purpose computer that is [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness Turing-complete].


====Analog Computers====
In early 20th century mechanical analog computers are designed to perform increasingly sophisticated computing, e.g. solving differential equations by integration. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_computer Analog computers] use continuously changeable aspects of physical phenomena such as electrical, mechanical, or hydraulic quantities to model/quantify computation, which lack the accuracy of modern digital computers.

====Digital Computers====
The world's first fully automatic digital computer is the electromechanical programmable computer [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z3_(computer) Z3] made by Konrad Zuse in 1041. Z3 uses electric switches that drive mechanical relays to perform computation. It replaces the decimal system with the binary system and pioneered the use of floating point numbers. Program and data are stored on punched film.

====Electronic Digital Computers====
The world's first electronic digital programmable computer is Colossus, built with a large number of valves (vacuum tubes) in 1943. The design was all electronic and was used to break the German Enigma code.  

====Transistor Computers====
From 1955 vacuum tubes were replaces by transistors in computer designs resulting in smaller, more reliable and more power efficient second generation computers. , giving rise to the &quot;second generation&quot; of computers. 

====Integrated Circuit Computers====
The invention of integrated circuit in 1952 ushered in a new era of computing machinery - micro-computers. Microprocessors with integrated circuit are used to build common computing devices you see today: desktop computers, laptop computers, phones, and greeting cards. 

===Principles of Digital Computing===
The mathematical foundation of digital computing is Boolean logic invented by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole George Boole]. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon Claude Shannon] proved in the 1930s that electronic circuits can compute in binary using Boolean logic, which becomes the fundamental principle/idea behind all modern computing devices.  

====Boolean Algebra====
Boolean algebra has three operations AND, OR, and NOT on two values: true and false. The rules for evaluating the three operations are shown in the figure. 

[[File:Truth table for AND, OR, and NOT.png|The truth table showing the rules for the three basic Boolean operations.]] 

A Boolean operation operates on Boolean values and always result in a Boolean value. For the AND operation the result is true only when both operands are true. The OR operation, on the other hand, only results in a false value if either of the two operands is false. The NOT operation takes one operand and simply negates it. We will see if we can build electronic circuits that implement the three operations we can build circuits that can perform all kinds of arithmetic and logic functions.

The three boolean operations can be implemented physically using transistors. A transistor is fundamentally a tiny switch as shown in the figure. 

[[File:A transistor is a tiny switch.png|A transistor is fundamentally a tiny switch with three pins. When a logical 1 is applied to the control pin the switch is closed connecting in to out.]] 

When a high voltage (logical 1) is applied to the control pin the switch is closed connecting the in pin directly to the out pin. Transistor operates on two voltages: high and low, which can be used to represent two different logical values: true and false or two binary values: 1 and 0. We will use a high voltage to physically represent a logical 1 and a low voltage a logical 0. 

====Transistors and Logic Gates====
Transistors are simple devices that are tiny, but it is fundamental building block of electronic circuits. For example we can build a device called NOT gate using a single transistor as shown in the figure. 

[[File:NOT gate with one transistor.png|A NOT gate constructed using a single transistor.]] 

If we treat what's inside the red box as a unit it behaves like negator, which is known as an NOT gate in digital logic design. As shown in the truth table for this device (next to the figure) when the input is logical 1 the switch is closed connecting the output to the ground dragging the output voltage to a low signifying a logical 0. On the other hand, when the input is logical 0 the switch stays open which result in a high voltage on the output line because it is connected to the power through a resister and without a current the resister will not cause any drop in power. Once this device is built we can use it as a building block to construct more complicated circuits. Will use the following symbol to represent a NOT gate. 

[[File:NOT gate.svg|NOT gate]] 

With transistors and the NOT gate we can build a device that performs the AND operation. 

[[File:AND gate with two transistors and a NOT gate.png|An AND gate built using two transistors and a NOT gate.]] 

As shown in the figure the device performs exact an AND operation. The output is logical 1 (high voltage) only when both inputs are logical 1, which causes both switches to close dragging the output before the NOT gate to low. The NOT gate then negates the output to be high voltage or logical 1.

Similarly we can build a device for performing the OR operation. 

[[File:OR gate with two transistors and a NOT gate.png|An OR gate built using two transistors and a NOT gate.]] 

A shown in the figure this kind of parallel structure guarantees that the output is high voltage as long as any transistor is closed. In other words, the relationship between the two inputs and the output is a OR logical function.

====Gates to Circuits====
With the three basic gates (AND, OR, NOT) we can build any combinational logic circuit. A circuit consists of input wires, gates connected by wires, and output wires. Once a circuit is designed it can be viewed as a black box that implements some logic mapping input to output. Here is the standard circuit construction algorithm: 
: build a truth table from the desired logic
: build a logic expression in sum-of-products form
: convert the expression to circuit design using gates

We want to construct a circuit that test the equality of two bits. The two inputs are the two bits represented physically by a high voltage (logical 1) or a low voltage (logical 0). According to the desired logic of the circuit we can draw the following truth table: 

[[File:Compare for equality.png|This logic tests whether two bits are the same/equal.]]

The first two columns enumerates all possible value combinations of the two input lines. The output is logical 1 (true) only when the two inputs are the same. Based on the truth table, we can derive the following logic expression (sum-of-products form): 
 (a AND b) OR ((NOT a) AND (NOT b))

To derive the sum-of-products form we check lines in the truth table with a logical 1 for the output. We know the input combinations shown in these lines are supposed to cause the output to become logical 1. We can represent each of these lines using a logic expression, for instance, (a AND b) represents the last line because when both a and b are logical 1 the expression evaluates to a logical 1 according to the definition of the  AND operation. Similarly ((NOT a) AND (NOT b)) represents the first line. If we combine the two cases, we can represent the desired logic using a single expression: (a AND b) OR ((NOT a) AND (NOT b)). If we plugin the inputs for the cases in the truth table this expression should evaluate to the same desired output values for the corresponding cases. Because we know how to build the devices (gates) that implement AND, OR, and operations we can build a device that can compare whether two bits are equal. This is device will be able to perform this kind of operation purely mechanically (blindly) because it doesn't know the meaning of the operation.   

Using the same methodology we can gradually build more and more complicated circuits. For example we could build a device that can add two binary digits: one-bit adder. It is just a matter of figuring out the desired logic and construct the device using the building blocks we already know how to make. 

[[File:One-bit adder.png|An adder circuit that adds two binary bits.]]
 
Once we construct the logic expression from the truth table we can build the circuit from the expression as shown in the figure. 

[[File:One bit adder.png|The circuit for producing the sum bit of a one bit adder.]]

===Family Typhaceae===
The '''{{fny-w|Typhaceae}}''' (cattail or bullrush family) naturally contains the genus ''{{fny-w|Typha}}'', which was the sole genus until the {{fny-w|APG III system}} added the genus ''{{fny-w|Sparganium}}'' (bur-reeds) in 2009 by merging the similar family '''Sparganiaceae''' into Typhaceae.

====Subfamily Sparganioideae====
This genus was previously included alone in the family {{fny-w|Sparganiaceae}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Sliders and Progress Bars=

Two other common widgets are presented here, the 'slider' and the 'progress-bar'.
These widgets serve distinct purposes; they are presented together here because they have similar properties.

=The Progress Bar=

The most basic of the two 'percentage widgets' is the progress bar.
The progress bar is a vertical bar that is filled to some partial degree; it is typically used to display the percentage of progress through some ongoing task.
(We will revisit background tasks later.)

The progress-bar has three important properties, perhaps the most obvious of which is the current value that it displays.
We can change the progress on some task by changing the value displayed in the progress bar.
The 'minimum value' and 'maximum valye' properties are also important; they allow us to use increments for our task that are convenient for our purposes, without having to do math in our code to convert our current status to a percentage.

==indeterminate mode==

We do not always know how long our applications will take to perform some task.
If we are writing a program to find the shortest path between two given URLs on the web, for example, we might not know what that shortest path is, or how much more work we will have to do to find that path.
In situations like this, we still wish to communicate to the user that our application is still running.

For this reason, many toolkits allow sliders to be placed in an 'indeterminate' mode.
In this mode, the slider does not display some given percent; rather, it will run some animation, such as pulsing or filling and unfilling.
This is useful because our slider is updated during the event/render loop; if the event/render loop is hung by something, the animation in our slider bar will stop running.

=The Slider=

The slider is a control rather then a display - or in addition to being a display.
The slider renders as a long bar with an indicator for the current value; it allows the user to grab the indicator and move it back and forth along the bar.

Like the progress-bar, the slider exposes its minimum, maximum and current value as properties; we could potentially use the slider as a progress display using these, and this is sometimes done in media players.
(Obviously, we should not use the slider bar purely as a display; the user will expect to be able to grab and move the slider to control the displayed value.)
However, the slider also gives us an interesting event; the &lt;code&gt;value_changed&lt;/code&gt; event; When the user grabs the slider and moves it, the &lt;code&gt;value_changed&lt;/code&gt; event will be triggered.

As with the combo box, the slider will usually offer the user sophisticated interactions, like the ability to cancel a change; the bar will typically issue the &lt;code&gt;value_changed&lt;/code&gt; event only when it is appropriate (not, for example, any time the slider is clicked).
Similarly, the slider will keep track of the user's interactions without our having to do any special event wiring.

Unlike the combo box (and the other button-like widgets), we often will want to connect to the &lt;code&gt;value_changed&lt;/code&gt; event.
If we are working on a media player, we would want do jump to a different location in the track being played when the user moves the slider.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Container Widgets=

The container widgets are widgets designed to contain other widgets, and add some useful capability to them.

(In many cases, they can be considered an example of the 'decorator' design pattern; see Appendix 1.)

=The Basic Widget and Layout Widgets=

Some of the widgets that we have already discussed are or can be viewed as container widgets.
One of the major ways that we build layouts is by placing child widgets inside a &lt;code&gt;BasicWidget&lt;/code&gt;; in this scenario, the &lt;code&gt;BasicWidget&lt;/code&gt; is serving as a container widget.
Similarly, in some kits, 'layouts' are widgets: we might have a &lt;code&gt;HorizontalBox&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Grid&lt;/code&gt; as a widget, for example, and any children that we added to these widgets would be laid out in a horizontal row, or on a grid.
In this case, the layout widgets are also 'container widgets'.

=The Border Widget=

Beyond the above, the simplest container widget (offered by some kits) is the 'border'.
The 'border widget', like the &lt;code&gt;BasicWidget&lt;/code&gt;, is designed to have children added to it; it lays them out just like a &lt;code&gt;BasicWidget&lt;/code&gt;.
The major difference is that the border widget will draw a 'border' around its contents.

Many kits do not include border widgets; in many modern kits, the &lt;code&gt;BasicWidget&lt;/code&gt; will have sophisticated styling capabilities, which will include the ability to draw a border around itself; this precludes the need for an separate border widget.

=The Group Box=

The 'group box' is an extension of the idea behind a border widget.
The group box is designed to contain child widgets, like a BasicWidget or border widget; it frequently draws (or can draw) a border around its children.
It has the additional ability to draw a label above the group; this allows you to group and label a set of controls.

The group box is the first of the container widgets to have a unique event or property: its label.
It will typically display its label near the children it contains; it may also display a border.

=The Scroller=

The major common container widget is the 'scroller'; if we have some widget that has very strict sizing rules (such as an image or text document), the scroller allows us to embed that widget in a GUI that might not be able to satisfy that child's sizing requirements.
The scroller adds the ability to be 'scrolled' to a child widget; that is, it adds scroll-bars to the lower- and right-edges of a child widget.
The scroller will report a very low minimum size to its parent widget; if the parent widget allocates the scroller less than the minimum (or preferred) size of the child widget, the scroller will shrink, will enable the scroll bars, and will show only part of the child widget.

In many kits, the Scroller can only have a single child; this is not as significant a restriction as it may seem, however, as a single &lt;code&gt;BasicWidget&lt;/code&gt; is a single widget from the perspective of the Scroller that it is placed in, but it can contain multiple child widgets.

=The TabBox=

The TabBox is designed to allow multiple widgets to use a single, finite allocation of screen space.
The TabBox can contain many child widgets, but it will only display one of them, and it will give the one widget that is displaying (almost) all of its screen space; the other child widgets (the ones that are not selected) will not be displayed.
There will also be a page list presented across the top of the widget, which will give the user the ability to select a child widget.
The user views the TabBox as containing 'pages', but each page is in fact a child widget.

In most cases, the system will keep track of the current page, and will switch the current shown page in response to a tab selection without our having to do anything.
The major bit of state data that we will need to track is the list of pages, and the association between the 'pages' (which are the widgets that we are adding) and their 'titles'.

The current page will typically be exposed as a property by the toolkit - this might be by the page title or by the numeric page number, depending on how the kit keeps track of pages.
Likewise, many kits will provide us with functions to switch the current page.

Most kits will provide us with events to track when the tab changes, but in 'most' cases we will not need to interact with this machinery, as the system will switch from page to page in response to the user clicking a tab-selector without our having to do anything.
The major exception to this rule would be if we wanted to prevent the user from switching tabs in certain circumstances - such as if each page represented a set of configurations that needed to be proceeded through in order, and we wished to prevent the user from prematurely jumping ahead.

The major event that we are likely to connect to - which is not provided by all kits - is the &lt;code&gt;tab_close_requested&lt;/code&gt; event.
The process of removing tabs from TabBoxes varies heavily from kit to kit, but some kits merely generate a &quot;close requested&quot; event when the user tries to close a tab; it is then up to us to explicitly remove the specific requested page from the TabBox.

There will be two major work-flows for using tab-boxes.
In the first case, we will know what elements will be in the tab box before-hand; this will be the case if, for example, we are using the TabBox to contain a multi-page configuration widget.
In this case, we will work with the TabBox much like we have been working with the parent widgets that we have used as canvases up to know: we will use our graphical tools to add pages, set layouts on the pages and drag child widgets onto the pages.

The more interesting case, however, is when we do not know the number or configuration of the tabs before-hand: this is the case if, for example, we were working on a document editor, and we were using the tabs to contain open documents.
In this case, most kits will have an &lt;code&gt;add_page&lt;/code&gt; function, which will (typically) take at least a widget (which is the page to add) and a title for the page.
This requires us to have constructed a widget that will represent each page; this is perhaps our first look at interacting with one widget that we have constructed from within another widget that we have constructed.

==PageStacks==

Some kits will also provide us with page stacks.
A page stack is much like the TabBox, in that it contains several children, but will only display one at a time.
However, it does not have the tab selector on top; rather, its entire area is given over to displaying the active child widget.
The major use for these containers is if we want to implement our own page selector, rather than using the tab bar provided by the system.

=The EventBox=

Some kits include a widget that contains a single child, and add new event capabilities to that child; this is the EventBox.
EventBoxes can be used to (in effect) add event-handling capabilities (like receiving click events) to widgets that do not normally have them (like labels or images).

EventBoxes will generally be included in kits whose event systems are not sufficiently flexible to allow widgets to easily choose what events they wish to generate or receive.
Many kits will provide widgets with several common events - such as mouse-enter, mouse-leave, mouse-down, mouse-up and mouse-click; these kits can then choose to handle these events or not.
In kits with such flexible event systems, there will be little need for an EventBox.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">My name is Liam Greenwood, I am 22 and studying a bachelor of sports coaching and exercise science/bachelor of human nutrition at the University of Canberra (UC). Interests revolve around sport and the implications to which exercise and nutrition have on sporting performance. 

==== 1. Background ====
Although I now reside in Canberra I am originally from Crookwell, New South Wales. After finishing year 12 and obtaining my certificate I enrolled at the University of Canberra to study a bachelor of sports coaching and exercise science/bachelor of human nutrition. I am currently in my third year of my four year course.

==== 2. Interests ====
As mentioned above my interests revolve around sport and sporting performance, in particular cricket and rugby league. As a result I play cricket in the summer and follow the NRL avidly.

==== 3. Wikibooks projects ====
A part of the coursework of the Health, Disease and Exercise unit is to create a fact sheet regarding a disease and the effect exercise has on that particular disease. This is the project to which I will be using this wiki. (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Exercise_as_it_relates_to_Disease)</text>

== What is Cystic Fibrosis? ==
Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a chronic genetic condition that is caused from the mutation of the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator gene and affects many systems in the body, predominately the respiratory system&lt;ref&gt;Farrell P et.al Guidelines for diagnosis of cystic fibrosis in newborns through older adults: cystic fibrosis foundation consensus report. J Pediatr. 2008; 153:4-14.  &lt;/ref&gt;. This condition is characterised by a malfucntion in the endocrine system which results in abnormal secretion of mucus in the both the digestive and respiratory system. This mucus increases the individuals risk of infection as the bacteria and pathogens are trapped in the respiratory or digestive tracts&lt;ref&gt;Cystic Fibrosis Australia. About Cystic Fibrosis [internet]. Available from:http://www.cysticfibrosis.org.au/all/learn/&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the present, there is no cure for Cystic Fibrosis, however there are some promising strategies including chest physiotherapy and regular physical activity which, when implemented correctly, can provide many positive effects and can supress the signs and symptoms of CF&lt;ref&gt;Elbasan B, Tunali N, Duzgan I &amp; Ozcelik U. Effects of chest physiotherapy and aerobic exercise training on physical fitness in young children with cystic fibrosis. Italian Journal of Pediatrics. 2012; 38(2): 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;. The effect of Aerobic exercise on CF is dependent on the disease severity and intensity and duration of exercise&lt;ref name=&quot;van&quot;&gt;Van de Weert-van Leeuwen P, Arets H, van der End C, Beekman J. Infection inflammation and exercise in cystic fibrosis. Respiratory Research. 2013;14(32):1-10.&lt;/ref&gt;. Exercise intolerance is well known to be a symptom of cystic fibrosis&lt;ref&gt;Troosters, T, Langer D, Vrijsen B, Wouters K, Janssens W, Gosselink R, Decramer M, Dupont L. Skeletal muscle weakness exercise tolerance and physical activity in adults with cystic fibrosis. Eur Respir J. 2009; 33: 99-106.&lt;/ref&gt;. Some of the other signs and symptoms attributed to Cystic Fibrosis include&lt;ref&gt;Symptoms of CF. Cystic Fibrosis Victoria. Retrieved from: http://www.cysticfibrosis.org.au/vic/symptoms&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Some breathing difficulties including wheezing and a persistent cough which is increased during physical activity 
* Suppressed appetite
* Lethargy, which may affect physical activity levels
* Loss of salt during warmer weather 
* Frequent toilet visits

== What are the Effects of Aerobic Exercise on Cystic Fibrosis? ==

While aerobic exercise has positve effects on the musculoskeletal, cardiorespiratory and immune systems for all individuals, the following list is the effects on aerobic exercise specific to individuals with CF.

=== Cardiorespiratory System ===
Aerobic Exercise has been shown to decrease the rate of decline in lung function, which has recorded to be at a rate of approximately 2-3% per year&lt;ref name= &quot;Orenstein&quot;&gt;Orenstein D, Higgins L. Update on the role of exercise in cystic fibrosis. Curr Opin Pulm Med. 2005; 11:519-523&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Dassios&quot;&gt;  Dassios T, Katelari A, Doudounakis S, Dimitriou G. Aerobic exercise and respiratory muscle sterngth in patients with cystic fibrosis.Respiratory Medicine. 2013;107:684-690&lt;/ref&gt;. It also has been shown to improve the transepithelial potential difference in the airway, which enhances the airway clearance and improves mucus removal while also increasing ventilation recruitment in the lungs. &lt;ref name= &quot;Dassios&quot;/&gt;
 
Individuals with CF generally display lower maximums in the VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; testing compared to healthy individuals&lt;ref&gt;Moser C, Tirakitsoontorn P, Nussbaum E, Newcomb R, Cooper D. Muscle size and cardiorespiratory response to exercise in cystic fibrosis.Am J Respir Crit Care Med. June 2000; 162: 1823-1827.  &lt;/ref&gt;. However, regular aerobic exercise, alongside age, sex, muscle and lung function may increase VO&lt;sub&gt;2max&lt;/sub&gt; scores&lt;ref name= &quot;Hebestreit&quot;&gt;Hebestreit H, Kieser S, Rudiger S, Schenk T, Junge S, Hebestreit A, Ballmann M, Posselt H, Kriemler. Physical activity is independently related to aerobic capacity in cystic fibrosis.Eur Respir J.2006; 28:734-739. &lt;/ref&gt;. Interestingly, improved VO&lt;sub&gt;2max&lt;/sub&gt; scores in CF have also been shown to improve quality of life measures including improved body image and physical functionality, which create more positive attitudes towards partaking in physical activity&lt;ref name= &quot;Hebestreit&quot;/&gt;.

Ventilation with CF is less efficient than healthy individuals when partaking in physical activity, as there is an increase in respiratory dead space, a high respiratory rate and consequently low tidal volume, which results in a lower rate of gas exchange&lt;ref name= &quot;Orenstein&quot;/&gt;. However, higher tolerance of exercise as a result of regular aerobic activity has been suggested to improve the tidal volume in the lungs and lower respiratory rate.

=== Immune System === 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Effects of Aerobic Exercise from One Session  &lt;ref name=&quot;van&quot;/&gt;

! Effects of Regular Aerobic Exercise &lt;ref name=&quot;van&quot;/&gt;

|-
| 
Can begin to reap the benefits from aerobic exercise from as little as one session, through inducing an anti-inflammatory response.However, depending on intensity, duration and type of activity, session may cause an heightened inflammatory response. 
|| 
Regular exercise allows the for the adaption to stimuli and produce lower amounts of pro-inflammatory modulators and increase pro inflammatory production in tissue such as visceral fat, skeletal muscles and immune cells subsequently dampening inflammation. Ones susceptibility to viral infection may also be decreased from the effects of exercise over the long term. 
 |
|}

=== Musculoskeletal System ===
Muscular strength may be lesser in individuals with CF due to hyperinflation and malnutrition, which may result in the fatigue in respiratory muscles during periods of aerobic exercise. From the respiratory inflammation characterised with CF and the insufficient respiratory power and efficiency of the muscle, people with CF generally are disadvantaged compared to their non-CF “healthy” counterparts&lt;ref name= &quot;Dunnink&quot;&gt;Dunnink M, Doeleman W, Trappenburg J, de Vries W. Respiratory muscle strength in stable adolescent and adult patients with cystic fibrosis. Journal of Cystic Fibrosis. 2009; 8:31-36.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Aerobic exercise has been shown to increase both the strength of muscles involved in the process respiration and the competence of neuromuscular transmission&lt;ref name=&quot;Dassios&quot;/&gt;.Positive correlations between walk/run distance and inspiratory muscle strength have been recorded in people with CF&lt;ref name= &quot;Dunnink&quot;/&gt;. Stronger inspiratory muscle may play a positive role in compensating for reduced lung function over the duration of aerobic exercise.

Aerobic exercise combined with regular cyclic breathing techniques and utilising chest physiotherapy has also conveyed not only increases in cardiovascular endurance but also increases thoracic strength&lt;ref name=&quot;Elbasan&quot;&gt;Elbasan B, Tunali N, Duzgun I, Ozcelik U. Effects of chest physiotherapy and aerobic exercise training on physical fitness in young children with cystic fibrosis. Italian Journal of Pediatrics. 2012; 38(2):1-5. &lt;/ref&gt;.

== Exercise Recommendations ==
The following are recommendations for individuals with CF partaking in aerobic exercise. 
* Individuals with CF should consult with their GP for a screening to determine what intensity, duration, type of aerobic exercise that is most applicable to their specific condiiton
* Aerobic Exercise should generally be of moderate intensity and duration&lt;ref name= &quot;Dassios&quot;/&gt;
.
* Implementing regular breathing techniques during exercise alongside chest physiotherapy has also shown to increase the clearance of mucus in the brochi, increase exercise tolerance, reduce the feeling of breathlessness and improve quality of life&lt;ref name=&quot;Elbasan&quot;/&gt;.
* Depending upon severity, aerobic exercise should be undertaken:&lt;ref name= &quot;Dassios&quot;/&gt;
 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Intensity !! Duration !! Frequency !! Examples
|-
| intensity of 60-85% HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; || 20-45 minutes || 3-5 times a week ||
* Walking
* Jogging
* Bike riding
* Swimming
|}
''HR&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;= maximum heart rate''

It should also be noted that not all individuals with CF experience the same benefits or effects of aerobic exercise. While symptoms may be supressed for some individuals from participating in phyical activity, for other they may be heightened and may experience greater breathing diffculties ,inflamation and mucus secretion. Individual responses may vary depending on a multitude of factors including severity of CF, overall health status and physical actvity levels &lt;ref name= &quot;Orenstein&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elbasan&quot;/&gt;.

==The insect olfactory system==
This sensory systems book is mostly about human sensory systems and there is a chapter about the olfactory system, so why do we need a chapter on the insect olfactory system?
The fruit fly (''drosophila melanogaster''), which we will focus on here, is a very important model animal in biology and a lot of research on sensory systems is done in the fruit fly. The visual as well as the olfactory system are studied intensively and there are less ethical or methodological limitations. With molecular genetic tools, any gene in a fly can be targeted (e.g. knocked out or overexpressed) and the system is much more manageable than in humans. While the olfactory system functions quite different from the human’s, it is possible to find common principles. Furthermore, the insect olfactory system inspires engineering in robotics, medicine and many other areas.

===The nature of smell===
[[File:Insect antennae comparison.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Different antenna types.]]
To understand the specifics of odor sensing one has to be aware that smell is quite different from other stimuli. It differs from light and sound by the fact that it is not carried by waves but by diffusion, air flows and turbulences. Furthermore, while light and sound only have the two perceptually relevant characteristics of frequency composition and amplitude, smell has a variety of discrete odorants and even more possible mixtures in different concentrations. 

===Overview===
[[File:Drosophila melanogaster antenna microscopic.jpg|thumb|Drosophila melanogaster antenna under a light microscope. The olfactory sensilla can be seen (like hairs on the antenna). The antenna is fixated with a glass capillary and on the top right a recording electrode can be seen. The diameter of the antenna is about 90 µm.]]
[[File:Schematic insect basiconic sensillum.png|thumb|Simplified schematic of a basiconic sensillum, like it can be found for example in the fruit fly.]]
In insects (but also in most vertebrates) the sensory system is of importance for orientation and food foraging but has also social (nest mate recognition e.g. in ants) and sexual (mating partner search and selection by pheromones) significance.
The main path of the odor information begins at the olfactory sensilla (insect’s sensory organs that contain the sensory neurons) that can in most insects be found on the antennae and look like small hairs in the fly (see Figure). There exists a huge variety of antenna types (that are not only used for olfaction) and many different sensillum types. 

To understand the general principle the example of drosophila melanogaster basiconic sensilla should suffice. 
The odorant molecules go through slits or pores of the cuticle into the aqueous sensillum lymph, where some types of odorant molecules are bound to odorant binding proteins and carried towards the dendrites of the olfactory receptor neurons (ORN), others diffuse in the lymph towards the dendrites. On the membrane of the dendrites there are odorant receptors (OR) that bind the odorant molecules and are responsible for the conversion of the signal into a membrane current. This current propagates through the dendrite to the cell body where (at the axon hill), an action potential is generated. The action potential travels in the ORN axon to the antennal lobe (which is analog to the olfactory bulb in vertebrates), where ORN make synapses to local interneurons and projection neurons. The antennal lobe is organized in so called glomeruli. It is not fully understood how they are involved in pattern recognition, but the glomerular activation pattern can provide information about the odors presented to the fly.

Projection neurons project into the lateral horn (where probably innate odor responses are processed) and to the Kenyon cells in the mushroom bodies. The mushroom bodies are a neuropil in the insect brain and have their name from the similarity to mushrooms. There, odors are associated with other sensory modalities and behavior which is why the mushroom bodies are an important model system to study learning and memory. 

===Odorant reception in ORN===
[[File:Response profile drosophila odorant receptors.PNG|thumb|500px|response profile of selected drosophila odorant receptors to two odors. Data source: DoOR Database [http://neuro.uni-konstanz.de/DoOR/default.html]]]
An insect’s olfactory sensillum contains one or more olfactory receptor neurons that transform the odor information into an electrical signal (action potential). Most ORNs contain only one receptor type, but each receptor type reacts to many odors (see Figure). However there are some receptors that are more specific as their detected odors have either an important role in the insect’s behavior or are chemically unique. An example for a more specific receptor is the receptor for CO2. Other odorants activate it only weakly and it directly triggers an avoidance response in the fly &lt;ref&gt;Suh GS, Ben-Tabou de Leon S, Tanimoto H, Fiala A, Benzer S, Anderson DJ: Light activation of an innate olfactory avoidance response in Drosophila. Curr Biol 2007, 17:905-908.&lt;/ref&gt;. Specificity of ORs is due to different affinity of odorants to the receptor. The higher the affinity the more receptors are occupied when an odor is applied and the stronger the current response. However, ORNs do not react linearly on stimulation. It can be assumed that most of them respond logarithmic within their working range which increases their dynamic range. The logarithmic relation does not apply to stimuli below the respective detection threshold and in saturation.
Most ORN show a phasic-tonic on-response, i.e. they react with a strong increase in firing rate when a stimulus is presented and then show rate adaptation if the stimulus persists.

Odorant receptors are membrane proteins that elicit an ionic current through the membrane, when an odorant molecule binds to them. There are two ways how this is accomplished in the olfactory system:
Metabotropic and ionotropic receptors.
In mammals olfactory receptors are known to be metabotropic g-protein coupled receptors that release a g-protein into the cell that activates an ion channel via a short intracellular signal cascade .
In contrast most olfactory receptors in insects are ionotropic receptors that are ion channels which open when an odorant molecule binds. Saving time on the signal cascade, ionotropic receptors are much faster than metabotropic receptors &lt;ref&gt;Silbering AF, Benton R (2010) Ionotropic and metabotropic mechanisms in chemoreception:  'chance or design'? EMBO reports 11:173-179.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Odor information processing===
The odor that reaches the antenna contains different parts of information:
On the one hand the odor identity, i.e. which odor or mixture it is, on the other hand the quantity of the components. Furthermore, the timing of the stimulus contains information. If two odors start for example at the same time, it is probable, that they belong to the same object. It has been shown, that insects indeed use the odorant timing information not only to detect the direction of an odor source but also to distinguish and track odor objects &lt;ref&gt;Baker TC, Fadamiro HY, Cosse AA (1998) Moth uses fine tuning for odour resolution. Nature  393:530-530.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Justus KA, Schofield SW, Murlis J, Carde RT (2002) Flight behaviour of Cadra cautella males in  rapidly pulsed pheromone plumes. Physiological Entomology 27:58-66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Szyszka P, Stierle JS, Biergans S, Galizia CG (2012) The Speed of Smell: Odor-Object Segregation  within Milliseconds. PloS one 7:e36096.&lt;/ref&gt;. The processing mechanism that enables this behavior is not clear, but it is amazing that already stimulus onset delays in the range of a few milliseconds can be useful.
There are recent results that suggest that the speed and the temporal resolution of the insect’s olfactory system are remarkable and much higher than expected. 

By means of calcium imaging, a method that visualizes cytoplasmic calcium by a fluorescent marker and therefore activity in neurons, it is possible to create a functional atlas of the antennal lobe. 
Basically all ORNs of one receptor neuron type, containing one OR, project into one glomerulus. So the (in the fruit fly about 54) glomeruli each unite the response of one receptor type and form a spatial pattern. However it has been shown that also the temporal dynamics of the glomeruli response is used to encode information &lt;ref&gt;DasGupta  S,  Waddell  S  (2008)  Learned  Odor  Discrimination  in  Drosophila  without  Combinatorial Odor Maps in the Antennal Lobe. Current biology : CB 18:1668-1674.&lt;/ref&gt;. The odor information is therefore encoded in the olfactory system by spatiotemporal firing patterns &lt;ref&gt;Brown, S. L., Joseph, J., &amp; Stopfer, M. (2005). Encoding a temporally structured stimulus with a temporally structured neural representation. Nature neuroscience, 8(11), 1568-1576.&lt;/ref&gt;.

So far it has not been possible to disentangle and understand the odor code in a way that is comparable to the knowledge of the visual and the auditory system. This might be due to the peculiarities of smell discussed above. There is no easily mappable topographic organization of neurons as the odor space is multidimensional and not continuous.

Glomerular activity patterns are linked in the mushroom bodies to behavior. Most insects show a high amount of plasticity there and e.g. bees are able to associate odors with a food reward after only a few presentations. Odor Information in the mushroom bodies is said to be represented by a sparse code, which means that only few kenyon cells respond with only few spikes. In contrast the above described code in the antennal lobe and in the ORNs it is a combinatorial code.

===Odor perception and behavioral significance===
For insects the olfactory system is of great behavioral significance. For example, as we all have probably experienced first-hand, mosquitos can track their victims by smell. Ants follow pheromone traces to food sources, but are also able to identify their nestmates by a colony specific hydrocarbon profile (and are therefore able to eliminate foes and thieves when they enter their territory). And many moths use sex pheromones to find mating partners. 

Usually odors in nature are not pure chemical substances but mixtures. However, those mixtures are perceived as a unit and are very often directly linked to a behavior. The neuronal response in the antennal lobe of a mixture cannot always be predicted by the response to the components &lt;ref&gt;Silbering, A. F., &amp; Galizia, C. G. (2007). Processing of odor mixtures in the Drosophila antennal lobe reveals both global inhibition and glomerulus-specific interactions. The Journal of Neuroscience, 27(44), 11966-11977.&lt;/ref&gt;. It should therefore not be taken for granted that the olfactory system works like an e-nose that is designed to analyze the components of the presented odor. Furthermore, compared to vision, where the information has to be processed deeply until the relevance of the content becomes obvious, the olfactory system is more strongly and directly linked to behavior (and at least in higher animals emotions). These connections are sometimes innate, but often also learned and idiosyncratic.

The follow articles describe the format of various user-editable files used within the Trainz environment.

When creating files for use with Trainz, care should be taken to follow the specified format accurately. Even if a particular deviation from the documented format is permitted by the current game and tools, it may become disallowed in future versions as loaders are updated and validation techniques are improved.

== Reading N3V File Formats ==
If you develop software which reads these file formats, you should accept and ignore minor deviations where feasible, in order to future-proof your software. Base your file reader on the documented format, not the particulars of the current Trainz implementation.
* ''It is far more likely that implementation-specific details'' will change between Trainz versions, ''whereas the file formats are typically extended but &lt;u&gt;not often&lt;/u&gt; replaced.''

== Writing Binary Files ==
There exist a number of binary file formats which are produced by N3V or by N3V-provided utilities and which are not formally documented. We strongly recommend that third-party developers do not write directly ''to'' these formats. N3V does not support any such tools or any files created by these tools. Reading ''from'' these undocumented binary formats is considered harmless but unsupported.

== Copy Protection ==
The use of any N3V binary file format should not be considered as a strong protection mechanism against snooping or modification except where specifically stated otherwise by N3V. Custom binary file formats are used to allow high-performance access to data from within the game environment. ''Security and obfuscation'' are neither primary not secondary goals for these formats, and N3V may provide mechanisms which convert from the binary formats back into &quot;common&quot; formats without prior notice.
{{TrainzTip|BG=lightyellow;|It should be noted that the technical capability of reverse-engineering the contents of a file does not equate to the legal right to modify or distribute said file. Nonetheless, experimentation and adaptation of others' assets has a long tradition in Trainz communities, but recognize there is a difference between doing something experimental locally on your own computer, and that of doing such and uploading it&amp;mdash;thereby violating strict international copyrights laws. {{TextBox |TTip=|pre=Bottom Line|BG=white|&lt;center&gt;'''Bottom Line:''' Before modifying someone else's content and sharing it, please seek the permission of the creator. &lt;br/&gt;If you are in any doubt as to your rights in this area, please seek advice from a legal professional.&lt;/center&gt;}}}}

Objectives:
* explain the definitions of forward, backward, and center divided methods for numerical differentiation
* find approximate values of the first derivative of continuous functions
* reason about the accuracy of the numbers
* find approximate values of the first derivative of discrete functions (given at discrete data points)

Resources

==Forward Divided Difference Method==
&lt;math&gt;f^{'}(x) = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h} + O(h)&lt;/math&gt;

The following code implements this method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from math import exp

def forward_diff(f, x, h=0.0001):
  df = (f(x+h) - f(x))/h
  return df

x = 0.5
df = forward_diff(exp, x)
print 'first derivative = ', df
print 'exp(', x, ') = ', exp(x)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Backward Divided Difference Method==
&lt;math&gt;f^{'}(x) = \frac{f(x)-f(x-h)}{h} + O(h)&lt;/math&gt;

The following code implements this method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from math import exp

def backward_diff(f, x, h=0.0001):
  df = (f(x) - f(x-h))/h
  return df

x = 0.5
df = backward_diff(exp, x)
print 'first derivative = ', df
print 'exp(', x, ') = ', exp(x)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Center Divided Difference Method==
&lt;math&gt;f^{'}(x) = \frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h} + O(h^{2})&lt;/math&gt;

The following code implements this method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from math import exp

def center_diff(f, x, h=0.0001):
  df = (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2.0*h)
  return df

x = 0.5
df = center_diff(exp, x)
print 'first derivative = ', df
print 'exp(', x, ') = ', exp(x)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Second Derivative==
&lt;math&gt;f^{''}(x) = \frac{f(x+h) - 2 f(x) + f(x-h)}{h^2} + O(h^2)&lt;/math&gt;

==Taylor Series==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series Taylor series] allows us to taylor expand a function into an infinite series. If the function is infinitely differentiable at number h, we can use the Taylor series to approximate the function. We can derive the backward, the forward, and the center divided difference  methods using Taylor series, which also give the quantitative estimate of the error in the approximation.  

&lt;math&gt; f(x+h) = f(x) + f^{'}(x)h + \frac{f^{(2)}(x)}{2!}h^{2}+\frac{f^{(3)}(x)}{3!}h^{3}+ \cdots \quad &lt;/math&gt;

For instance the &lt;math&gt;sin(x)&lt;/math&gt; function can be approximated by the truncated Taylor series:

&lt;math&gt;\sin\left( x \right) \approx x - \frac{x^3}{3!} + \frac{x^5}{5!} - \frac{x^7}{7!}\!&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:Taylorsine.svg|400px|The sine function (blue) is closely approximated by its Taylor polynomial of degree 7 (pink) for a full period centered at the origin.]]

==Effect of Step Size==
The following is a program that calculates the first derivative of &lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; at x=0.5 from the center divided difference formula using different values of h. The result shows that the approximation becomes more accurate (more significant digits) as step size becomes smaller but the when the step size becomes too small the rounding off error become significant. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from math import exp

def center_diff(f, x, h=0.0001):
  df = (f(x+h) - f(x-h))/(2.0*h)
  return df

x = 0.5
df = center_diff(exp, x)
print 'first derivative = ', df
print 'exp(', x, ') = ', exp(x)

h=0.125
for i in range(50):
  df = center_diff(exp, x, h)
  print &quot;h=&quot;, h, &quot;df=&quot;, df
  h = h/2.0

Python is a scripting language. You can use the interactive Python console to write and execute code. After you log into a Unix/Linux system you can type the type the word &quot;python&quot; (with the quotes) to start the console and hit ^D (ctrl+D) will exit the console. This kind of interactivity makes it ideal for exploratory discovery - finding a solution by exploring and experimentation. 

==REPL==
The Python console executes a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL), which means it prompts you for a expression/command and once you hit enter it will read your expression, evaluate it, print the value of the expression, and prompt you for the next expression. This makes it very easy to test a Python statement. You can use it as a calculator: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;1+2
3
&gt;&gt;&gt;2**3
8
&gt;&gt;&gt; # this is a comment
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; 2**0.5
1.4142135623730951
&lt;/source&gt; 

==Import Libraries==
Many useful functions have been implemented in libraries. To use the functions you need to import them so that their names are recognized. The dir() function prints a directory of objects (functions) available in a module: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;import math
&gt;&gt;&gt;dir(math)
['__doc__', '__name__', '__package__', 'acos', 'acosh', 'asin', 'asinh', 'atan', 'atan2', 'atanh', 'ceil', 
'copysign', 'cos', 'cosh', 'degrees', 'e', 'erf', 'erfc', 'exp', 'expm1', 'fabs', 'factorial', 'floor', 'fmod', 
'frexp', 'fsum', 'gamma', 'hypot', 'isinf', 'isnan', 'ldexp', 'lgamma', 'log', 'log10', 'log1p', 'modf', 
'pi', 'pow', 'radians', 'sin', 'sinh', 'sqrt', 'tan', 'tanh', 'trunc']
&gt;&gt;&gt; help(math.exp)
Help on built-in function exp in module math:
exp(...)
    exp(x)
    
    Return e raised to the power of x.
&gt;&gt;&gt; # this is similar to 2 ** 0.5
&gt;&gt;&gt; math.sqrt(2)
1.4142135623730951
&lt;/source&gt;
The help() function can be used to find the meaning and the usage of an object from a library as shown in the previous code example. Note that you need to hit the letter Q to quit the help session to return to the Python console.

==Data Types==
Python is not a strongly typed language, which means you do not need to declare a specific data type for a variable. But data items associated with variables have types, which are implied - derived from the expression or the operation on the data items. Therefore the data type of a variable can change over time. The type() function will tell you the type of data stored in a variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
&lt;type 'int'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(1)
&lt;type 'int'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
&lt;type 'float'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = &quot;one&quot;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
&lt;type 'str'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = False 
&gt;&gt;&gt; print a False
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
&lt;type ’bool’&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = 1 + 2j
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
&lt;type 'complex'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = [1, 2, 3]
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
&lt;type 'list'&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

There are functions that convert between data types, e.g. int(), float(), str(), and list().
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = int(&quot;123&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
123
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
&lt;type 'int'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = float(&quot;123.4&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
123.4
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
&lt;type 'float'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = str(123.4)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
'123.4'
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
&lt;type 'str'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a =  list(&quot;one two three&quot;)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
['o', 'n', 'e', ' ', 't', 'w', 'o', ' ', 't', 'h', 'r', 'e', 'e']
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
&lt;type 'list'&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Data types get promoted automatically as necessary. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; import sys
&gt;&gt;&gt; sys.maxint
9223372036854775807
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(sys.maxint)
&lt;type 'int'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(sys.maxint+1)
&lt;type 'long'&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In Python strings, lists and tuples are sequences. They can be indexed and sliced in the same way. A list in Python can contain data items of different type.
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; range(10)
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(10):
...     print i ** 2
... 
0
1
4
9
16
25
36
49
64
81
&lt;/source&gt;

==Source Files==
In addition to write and running Python code directly in the console you can save your commands/statements in a file and run the whole file as a script using the Python interpreter. For example, in a shell command-line you can type the following to run your program/script called hello.py:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
python hello.py
&lt;/source&gt;

Indentation matters in Python because it is used for defining scopes, which eliminates the use of braces {}. Please make sure the code at the same level are indented the same amount represented by tab or space characters.

==Formatted Printing==
You can print numbers using a format string similar to the printf function in C. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;a = 0.1
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
0.1
&gt;&gt;&gt;print &quot;%20.19f&quot; % a
0.1000000000000000056
&lt;/source&gt;

This example show the limit of the floating point number representation. 1/10 can not be represented precisely because it is not a power of two. Even though the console prints a as 0.1 the underlying representation is almost 0.1.

==Numerical Computation==
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; import math
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = math.sqrt(2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
1.4142135623730951
&gt;&gt;&gt; a ** 2
2.0000000000000004
&lt;/source&gt;
The following example will run forever till the result overflows the registers because x will never become exactly 1.0 because the representation of 0.1 is an approximation (with an error). 
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 0.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; while not x == 1.0:
...     x = x + 0.1 
...     print(&quot;x=%19.17g&quot; % (x))
... 
x=0.10000000000000001
x=0.20000000000000001
x=0.30000000000000004
x=0.40000000000000002
x=                0.5
x=0.59999999999999998
x=0.69999999999999996
&lt;/source&gt;
The moral of the lesson is: do not compare floating point numbers for strict equality. Alternatively we can calculate the distance between the two numbers and stop when the distance is short enough (less than a threshold).
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 0.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; while abs(x - 1.0) &gt; 1e-8:
...     x = x + 0.1
...     print(&quot;x=%19.17g&quot; % (x))
... 
x=0.10000000000000001
x=0.20000000000000001
x=0.30000000000000004
x=0.40000000000000002
x=                0.5
x=0.59999999999999998
x=0.69999999999999996
x=0.79999999999999993
x=0.89999999999999991
x=0.99999999999999989
&lt;/source&gt;
If we know exactly how many iterations to perform we can use a for loop as shown below. Note that range(1, 11) =&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; for i in range(1, 11):
...     x = i * 0.1
...     print(&quot;x=%19.17g&quot; % (x))
... 
x=0.10000000000000001
x=0.20000000000000001
x=0.30000000000000004
x=0.40000000000000002
x=                0.5
x=0.60000000000000009
x=0.70000000000000007
x=0.80000000000000004
x=0.90000000000000002
x=                  1
&lt;/source&gt;
What does the following piece of code compute? Will the loop ever finish? Why?
&lt;source lang=&quot;Python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; eps = 1.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; while 1.0 + eps &gt; 1.0:
...     eps = eps / 2.0
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt; print eps
1.11022302463e-16
&lt;/source&gt;
The value eps has will always be a power of 2, therefore there will not be any rounding off errors. However, as the while loop continues eps gets smaller and smaller. Eventually eps become so small it becomes nothing comparing to 1.0, which means adding it to 1.0 will result in 1.0. Recall that the machine epsilon is the smallest value when added to 1.0 will result in value different than 1.0. If a number is less than the machine epsilon and it will cause no effect when it is added to 1.0. &lt;code&gt;sys.float_info&lt;/code&gt; tells us that the machine epsilon is 2.220446049250313e-16, which is slightly less than 2x1.11022302463e-16=2.22044604926e-16. This is why when the loop ends eps equals 1.11022302463e-16.

==Symbolic Computation==
The [http://sympy.org/en/index.html SymPy] library for Python allows us to manipulate variables symbolically (as symbols). The following code snippets demonstrates some basic functionality of SymPy.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; from sympy import Symbol
&gt;&gt;&gt; x = Symbol('x');
&gt;&gt;&gt; x+2*x+3*x
6*x
&gt;&gt;&gt; y=x+2*x+3*x
&gt;&gt;&gt; y
6*x
&gt;&gt;&gt; y.subs(x, 2)
12
&gt;&gt;&gt; from sympy import diff
&gt;&gt;&gt; diff(y, x)
6
&gt;&gt;&gt; from sympy import sin, cos
&gt;&gt;&gt; diff(sin(x), x)
cos(x)
&gt;&gt;&gt; diff(cos(x), x)
-sin(x)
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 4 - 1/x
&gt;&gt;&gt; y.diff()
x**(-2)
&gt;&gt;&gt; y.diff().subs(x, 0.5)
4.00000000000000
&gt;&gt;&gt; from sympy import series
&gt;&gt;&gt; sin(x).series(x, 0)
x - x**3/6 + x**5/120 + O(x**6)
&gt;&gt;&gt; sin(x).series(x, 0, 10)
x - x**3/6 + x**5/120 - x**7/5040 + x**9/362880 + O(x**10)
&lt;/source&gt;

A array in numpy is multidimensional table of elements of the same type. The elements are indexed by a tuple of positive integers. The name of the class for numpy arrays is ndarray, a.k.a array. Each array object has a number of attributes:
* mdim: number of dimensions
* shape: a tuple of integers indicating the size of the array in each dimension. A matrix with m rows and n columns will have (m, n) as its shape.
* size: the total number elements in an array.
* dtype: the type of elements in an array.
The elements in an array can be referenced using different syntax as shown in the examples below.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; from numpy import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = arange(15).reshape(3, 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],
       [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],
       [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; type(a)
&lt;type 'numpy.ndarray'&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.shape
(3, 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; (rows, cols) = a.shape
&gt;&gt;&gt; rows
3
&gt;&gt;&gt; cols
5
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.ndim
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.size
15
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[2, 3]
13
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[2][3]
13
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[-1]
9
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[-2]
8
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[-2:]
array([8, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[2:]
array([2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[:-3]
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[:]
array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = arange(15).reshape(3, 5)
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4],
       [ 5,  6,  7,  8,  9],
       [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[1, ...]
array([5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a[:, 0]
array([ 0,  5, 10])
&lt;/source&gt;

An numpy array can be created from a regular Python list or tuple using the array function. The type of the array elements depends on that of the elements in the sequences.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = array([[1, 2], [2, 3]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
array([[1, 2],
       [2, 3]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = array(((4, 5), (6, 7)))
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
array([[4, 5],
       [6, 7]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.dtype
dtype('int64')
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; b = array([(1.2, 1.3), (1.4, 1.5)])
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
array([[ 1.2,  1.3],
       [ 1.4,  1.5]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; b.dtype
dtype('float64')
&lt;/source&gt;
 
Numpy includes functions that create arrays with default values. The eye() function creates a identity matrix and the identity() performs a similar function. The copy function clones an array object includes the data it contains.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; zeros((2, 3))
array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0.]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; ones((3, 4))
array([[ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.],
       [ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.],
       [ 1.,  1.,  1.,  1.]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; empty((2, 3))
array([[  2.68156159e+154,   2.68156159e+154,   2.68156242e+154],
       [  2.68156159e+154,   2.68156159e+154,   2.68156159e+154]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; eye(3, 3)
array([[ 1.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  1.]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; identity(3, float)
array([[ 1.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  1.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  1.]])
&lt;/source&gt;

Arithmetic operations on numpy arrays are element-wise operations. The product * operator does a element-wise multiplication. The dot function performs matrix multiplications.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
array([[1, 2],
       [3, 4]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; b = a.copy()
&gt;&gt;&gt; b
array([[1, 2],
       [3, 4]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a*b
array([[ 1,  4],
       [ 9, 16]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; dot(a, b)
array([[ 7, 10],
       [15, 22]])
&lt;/source&gt;

Numpy also includes a number of basic linear algebra functions.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; from numpy.linalg import *
&gt;&gt;&gt; a = array([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a
array([[ 1.,  2.],
       [ 3.,  4.]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; a.transpose()
array([[ 1.,  3.],
       [ 2.,  4.]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; inv(a)
array([[-2. ,  1. ],
       [ 1.5, -0.5]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = array([[5.], [7.]])
&gt;&gt;&gt; solve(a, y)
array([[-3.],
       [ 4.]])
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Rounding Off Errors=
Learning objectives:
* recognize the sources of overflow and underflow errors
* convert between decimal representation and floating point representation 
* understand the IEEE 754 standard of a floating point representation on computers
* calculate the machine epsilon of a representation. 

==Integer Overflow (Error)==
How are integers represented on a computer?

Most computers use the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two's_complement 2's complement] representation. Assume we have 4 bits to store and operate on an integer we may end up with the following situation:

  0111 (7)
 +0001 (1)
 -----
  1000 (-8)

The numbers in parentheses are the decimal value represented by the 2's complement binary integers. The result is obviously wrong because adding positive numbers should never result in a negative number. The reason for the error is that result exceeds the range of values the 4-bit can store with the 2's complement notation. 

The following example gives the wrong answer for the same reason. The leading 1 can not be stored.

  1000 (-8)
 +1111 (-1)
 -----
 10111 (7)

==Floating-point Underflow (Error)==
In math numbers have infinite precision, but numerals (representations of number) have finite precision. One third (1/3) can not be represented precisely in decimal or it would require a infinite number of digits, which is impossible. Similarly 0.2 can not be represented precisely in binary, which means its binary representation is not precise (an approximation).

When numbers are computed/calculated on a computer, the representations of the numbers are being manipulated and the result will very likely be imprecise. This is an important limitation of computing. Essentially the computer must be considered a part of our model when we solve problems computationally. We must factor the computer in because it is a binary computer approximating base ten numbers.

An [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_underflow floating-point underflow or underflow] happens when the result of a calculation is too small to be stored. A underflow can be caused by the (negative) overflow of the exponent. 
:What is the binary representation of &lt;math&gt;11.1875_{10}&lt;/math&gt;?

===Fixed-point Representation===
Any real number can be represented in binary as a fixed-point number. To convert the number from its decimal (base ten) representation to it binary representation we need to convert the integer part and the fractional part to binary separately because different methods are required. Please check out the following resource on how to do that [http://mathforcollege.com/nm/topics/binary_representation.html].

With a fixed number of digits and a fixed decimal point the range of representable values is fixed. Given five digits as follows &lt;math&gt;nnn.nn_{10}&lt;/math&gt;, we can represent positive values from &lt;math&gt;0.01_{10}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;999.99_{10}&lt;/math&gt;. Using the following scientific notation &lt;math&gt;nnn \times 10^{nn}&lt;/math&gt; we can represent positive values ranging from &lt;math&gt;0.01_{10}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;99900_{10}&lt;/math&gt;, which is much larger than that of the fixed-point representation.

===Floating-point Representation===
Given a fixed number of digits we can represent a larger range of values using the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating_point floating-point] format. The IEEE 754 format is a international standard on floating-point representation of numbers in computers. A 32-bit floating point number (single precision) is represented using three parts as shown in the figure: : a sign bit, a (biased) exponent, and a fraction. [[File:IEEE 754 Single Floating Point Format.svg|none|The number 0.15625 represented as a single-precision IEEE 754-1985 floating-point number. See text for explanation.]]
The value represented by an IEEE 754 single precision floating point number can be calculated using the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;(-1)^{sign} \times 1.fraction \times 2^{exponent - 127}&lt;/math&gt;

For example to store in IEEE single precision floating point format &lt;math&gt;0.15625_{10}=0.00101_{2}=1.01_2 \times 2^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;, we need to store a sign bit of &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; (0 means positive and 1 means negative), a fraction of &lt;math&gt;.01&lt;/math&gt;, and a biased exponent of &lt;math&gt;-3_{10}+127_{10}=124_{10}=1111100_2&lt;/math&gt;. Because all numbers except 0 will have a leading one in the binary &quot;scientific&quot; representation that one is no stored in IEEE 754 format to save one bit. We will say the value 0 is represented in a moment.

The biased exponent is just a clever way to use the available bits to represent more values and make number comparison faster. We will use 8-bit exponent as an example. In the figure to the right we have 8-bit which can represent &lt;math&gt;2^8=256_{10}&lt;/math&gt; different things. The bit patterns have no intrinsic meaning, so we can use them to represent anything we want. The green part shows the values those bit patterns represent when they are treated as binary representations of unsigned integers. The problem is that we want to represent negative values as well. One easy solution is to treat the left most bit as the sign bit: 0 means positive and 1 means negative, which result in two zeros &lt;math&gt;+0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-0&lt;/math&gt;. The blue part shows what happens when we use the 2's complement scheme to represent both positive and negative values using the same set of bit patterns. Recall that the 2's complement scheme is often used to simply hardware design so that we can use addition to do subtraction: a - b is the same as a + (the 2's complement of -b). To get the 2's complement of a positive integer is to invert all the bits and add 1 to it. Now any subtraction can be done with a inversion and two additions. The problem with 2's complement representation is that a &quot;larger&quot; looking pattern does not necessarily represent a larger value. 
[[File:Biased exponent.png|none|This figure shows how the biased exponent for IEEE 754 works.]] 
The red part shows the biased exponent represented by the same set of bit patterns. As you can see a &quot;larger&quot; looking pattern always represent a larger value except for the all one patterns, which is used to represent a special value. The advantage of the biased exponent representation is that each value is represented by a unique pattern (no two zeros) and comparing floating point numbers is easier. The exponent is put before the fraction in IEEE 754 standard so that floating point numbers can be compared by treating their bit patterns as unsigned integers (much faster). Engineers are indeed infinitely clever :)

The following table shows some special values represented by special bit patterns.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  biased expoent !! fraction !! numbers
|-
| 00...00 || 0 || 0 
|-
| 00...00 || nonzero || denormalized
|-
| 11...11 || 0 || +/- infinity
|-
| 11...11 || nonzero || NaN (Not a Number)

Because the implicit/hidden 1 is always added to the fraction to get the represented value a special pattern is needed to represent the zero value. Now the result of a division by zero can be represented as +/- infinity (division by zero in integer operation will crash your program). &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-4}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0/0&lt;/math&gt; can be represented as NaN, which helps debugging your programs.  

:What is the IEEE 754 floating-point representation of this number: &lt;math&gt;-2.340625 \times 10^1&lt;/math&gt;
:What is the decimal equivalent of this IEEE 754 floating-point number: 1100 0000 1111 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000?
:What is the largest IEEE 754 single precision floating-point number?

What are the downsides of floating-point or scientific representation? With five digits we can represent &lt;math&gt;999.99_{10}&lt;/math&gt; precisely using fixed point notation. However, when we use the following scientific/floating-point notation &lt;math&gt;n.nn \times 10^{nn}&lt;/math&gt; the closest value we can represent is &lt;math&gt;9.99 \times 10^{02}&lt;/math&gt; and the error is &lt;math&gt;999.99-999=0.99&lt;/math&gt; - a loss of precision. 

===Real v.s. Floating-point Number Lines===
This [http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/9/4/4/fig1.jpg figure] illustrates the different the number line for real numbers and that for floating point numbers. The following observations can be made:
* The real number line is continuous, dense, and infinite.
* The floating-point number (representation) line is discrete, sparse, and finite.
* A group of real numbers are represented by the same floating-point number (an approximation).
* The sizes of groups get larger and larger as the floating-point numbers get larger. 

Lets study a concrete example. With four decimal digits and a fixed point representation (&lt;math&gt;nnn.n&lt;/math&gt;) we can represent 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ..., 999.8, 999.9 with equal distance between the consecutive numbers. With a floating-point representation (&lt;math&gt;+n.nn \times 10^{\pm n}&lt;/math&gt;) , the smallest value we can represent is &lt;math&gt;1.00 \times 10^{-9}=0.\underbrace{0...0}_8 1&lt;/math&gt; and the largest representable value is &lt;math&gt;1.11 \times 10^{+9}=1110000000&lt;/math&gt;. Now lets look at representable values by this floating-point number format around some points on the number line:
*Next to 0: &lt;math&gt;1.00 \times 10^{-9}=0.\underbrace{0...0}_8 1, 1.01 \times 10^{-9}=0.\underbrace{0...0}_8 101, 1.02 \times 10^{-9}=0.\underbrace{0...0}_8 102, ...&lt;/math&gt; (the distance between consecutive numbers is 0.00000000001)
*Next to 1: &lt;math&gt;1.00 \times 10^{0}=1, 1.01 \times 10^{0}=1.01, 1.02 \times 10^{0}=1.02, ...&lt;/math&gt; (the distance between consecutive numbers is 0.01)
*Next to 10: &lt;math&gt;1.00 \times 10^{1}=10, 1.01 \times 10^{1}=10.1, 1.02 \times 10^{1}=10.2, ...&lt;/math&gt; (the distance between consecutive numbers is 0.1)
*Next to 100: &lt;math&gt;1.00 \times 10^{2}=100, 1.01 \times 10^{2}=101, 1.02 \times 10^{2}=102, ...&lt;/math&gt; (the distance between consecutive numbers is 1)
*Next to 1000: &lt;math&gt;1.00 \times 10^{3}=1000, 1.01 \times 10^{3}=1010, 1.02 \times 10^{3}=1020, ...&lt;/math&gt; (the distance between consecutive numbers is 10)

As you can see not every real number can be represented using the floating-point format. The distribution of the representable values is not uniform: it is denser around smaller values and more sparse (spread out) around larger values, which means the larger a value we want to represent the less precise we can do it.

What is the smallest IEEE 754 single precision number greater than 1?

===Machine Epsilon===
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon Machine epsilon] is defined to be the smallest positive number which, when added to 1, gives a number different from 1. The machine epsilon for floating-point format is &lt;math&gt;b^{-(p-1)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; is the base (radix) and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; (precision) is the number of digits for the fraction plus one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
Mathematical models are a central piece of science and engineering. Some models have closed-form solutions, therefore they can solved analytically. Many models can not be solved analytically or the analytic solution is too costly to be practical. All models can be solved computationally and the result may not be the exact answer but it can be useful. George E. P. Box was right by saying [https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box All models are wrong, but some are useful.] Since errors are inevitable a more practical question we ought to ask is how close the answer needs to be for it to be useful.  In lots of engineering situations the only way to get the &quot;right answer&quot; is to use the following formula:

right answer = wrong answer + corrections

:[http://mathforcollege.com/nm/topics/measuring_errors.html Chapter 1 of Holistic Numerical Methods]

==True and Relative True Errors==
A true error (&lt;math&gt;E_t&lt;/math&gt;) is defined as the difference between the true (exact) value and an approximate value. This type of error is only measurable when the true value is available. You might wonder why would we use an approximate value instead of the true value. One example would be the true value can not be represented precisely due to the notational system and the limit of the physical storage we use.
 true error (&lt;math&gt;E_t&lt;/math&gt;) = true value - approximate value

A true error doesn't signify how great an error is. For instance a 0.1 pound error is very small error when measuring a person's weight, but the same error can be disastrous when measuring the dosage of a medicine. Relative true error (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_t&lt;/math&gt;) is defined as the ratio between the true error and the true value.  
 relative true error (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_t&lt;/math&gt;)   = true error / true value

==Approximate and Relative Approximate Errors==
Often times the true value is unknown to us, which is usually the case in numerical computing. In this case we will have to quantify errors using approximate values only. When an iterative method is used we get a approximate value at the end of each iteration. The approximate error (&lt;math&gt;E_a&lt;/math&gt;) is defined as the difference between the present approximate value  and the previous approximation.
 approximate error (&lt;math&gt;E_a&lt;/math&gt;) = present approximation – previous approximation 

Similarly we can calculate the relative approximate error (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_a&lt;/math&gt;) by dividing the approximate error by the present approximate value.
 relative approximate error (&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_a&lt;/math&gt;)  = approximate error / present approximation

==Relative Approximate Error and Significant Digits==
Assume our iterative method yield a better approximation as the iteration goes on. Often times we can set an acceptable tolerance to stop the iteration when the relative approximate error is small enough. We often set the tolerance in terms of the number of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures significant digits] -  the number of digits that carry meaning contributing to its precision. It correspond to the number of digits in the scientific notation to represent a number's [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significand significand or mantissa]. 

An approximate rule for minimizing the error is as follows: if the absolute relative approximate error is less than or equal to a predefined tolerance (usually in terms of the number of significant digits) then the acceptable error has been reached and no more iterations would be required. Given the an absolute relative approximate error we can derive the least number of digits that are significant using the same equation.  
 &lt;math&gt;|\epsilon_a| \le 0.5 \times 10^{2-m}%&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <comment>/* Which breakfast cereal should I buy? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page aims to help you understand why it is important to be eating a healthy breakfast everyday. It also includes a simple guide to choosing breakfast cereals. 

[[File: NCI Visuals Food Meal Breakfast.jpg|breakfast time|right|370px]]

==Why is breakfast important?== 
Well firstly.. it '''gives you energy'''! It's the first meal that you have when you wake up after a long night of fasting. It's there to 'break' the 'fast'. It's particularly important for your BRAIN, which need sugars to be able to work and '''concentrate properly'''. 

It also '''boosts your metabolism'''! This means your body is working faster and burning more energy up.
Breakfast '''fills you up''', which makes you less likely to get hungry later and start eating snacks which are often high in energy and fat. 

It has been found that people who eat breakfast are '''LESS LIKELY to become OVERWEIGHT'''.

FINALLY.. it can be a '''great source of fibre, whole grains, vitamins and minerals'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;(DAA, n.d.).&quot;&gt;DAA. (n.d.). ''Breakfast''. Retrieved from http://daa.asn.au/for-the-public/smart-eating-for-you/nutrition-a-z/breakfast/
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Do I have time?==
[[File:2010-07-20 Black windup alarm clock face.jpg|thumb|left|100px]]
Not having enough time stops many people from having breakfast. BUT breakfast doesn't have to take a long time. 

Here are some quick tips that can help you fit breakfast into your morning routine!
* Set your alarm 5 minutes earlier - make up for it by going to sleep 5 minutes earlier
* Have a simple breakfast - e.g. bowl of cereal, piece of toast
* Eat it on the go - take it with you
* Prepare or pack it the night before - e.g. soak your oats the night before so they're ready to eat  when you wake up

==Which breakfast cereal should I buy?==
[[File:SAS Supermarket - interior-7.jpg||250px|right|Supermarket aisles can be overwhelming!]]
Breakfast cereals can be a quick and easy meal to have in the morning. But when you're standing in the breakfast aisle of the supermarket, and hundreds of cereals are calling to you, which one should you choose??

SO, I've created a list of things to look at, which can help you to choose a healthy breakfast cereal. 
These include: fibre, whole grains, sugar, salt, vitamins, and minerals. 

===Fibre===
Adults are recommended to eat 25-30 grams of fibre every day.&lt;ref name=&quot;(NHMRC, 2006).&quot;&gt;NHMRC. (2006). ''Dietary Fibre''. Retrieved from http://www.nrv.gov.au/nutrients/dietary-fibre
&lt;/ref&gt; This helps to keep your digestive system healthy and regular. It can also decrease your risk of bowel cancer, diabetes and heart disease. 
Fibre is found in breads, fruit, vegetables AND breakfast cereals. 
* Try to choose cereals with '''at least 10% fibre''' in them&lt;ref name=&quot;(food labels).&quot;&gt;NHMRC. (n.d.). ''How to understand food labels''. Retrieved from https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/eatingwell/efh_food_label_example_large.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;
You can check this by looking at the nutrition panel: 
# Find the word 'fibre' 
# Follow fibre across to the 'per 100g' column 
# There will be a number here, which equals a percentage. e.g. fibre per 100g = 10g (this equals 10%)

===Wholegrain===
A grain includes 3 parts: bran, germ and endosperm
Some breakfast cereals are ''refined'', with the bran and germ removed from the grain. 
This means 25% of the protein is lost as well as many vitamins, minerals, antioxidants and healthy fats.
[[File:Bread and grains.jpg|Bread and grains|170px|right]]
SO.. we want to choose cereals which have the whole grain still in them!
# Find the cereals ingredients list
# Look for the word ''''WHOLE'''' (e.g. whole wheat)
# The higher percent of whole grains the better

===Sugar===

This sweet substance is a source of energy BUT too much can lead to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sugar&quot;&gt; Better Health Channel. (2011). ''Sugar''. Retrieved from http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Sugar
&lt;/ref&gt;

Try and find breakfast cereals which contain:
* '''less than 15% sugar'''&lt;ref name=&quot;(food labels).&quot;&gt;NHMRC. (n.d.). ''How to understand food labels''. Retrieved from https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/eatingwell/efh_food_label_example_large.pdf 
&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bowl of white sugar without background.jpg|140px|right|Bowl of white sugar without background]]
* '''less than 25% sugar if it contains dried fruit'''
To check the percent of sugar:
# Find sugar in the nutrition panel
# Look across to the column which says &quot;per 100g&quot;
# The number here is the percent of sugar this cereal contains (e.g. 10g per 100g = 10%)

If you find your cereal isn't sweet enough, try adding ''honey'' or ''fruit'' as a sweetener instead of sugar.

===Salt===
There can be surprisingly large amounts of salt in cereals!
Salt is made from sodium and chloride. 
Eating too much sodium can increase your risk of getting high blood pressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;(salt).&quot;&gt;Better Health Channel. (2013). ''Salt''. Retrieved from http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Salt?open
&lt;/ref&gt;

Try and choose a cereal which has '''less than 400mg of sodium per 100g''' &lt;ref name=&quot;(food labels).&quot;&gt;NHMRC. (n.d.). ''How to understand food labels''. Retrieved from https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/sites/default/files/files/eatingwell/efh_food_label_example_large.pdf
&lt;/ref&gt;

# find the word 'sodium' in the nutrition panel
# look across to the 'per 100g' column
# the number here is in mg (e.g. 400 = 400mg)

===Vitamins and minerals===
Many cereals can contain added vitamins and minerals which can help you achieve the daily [http://www.nrv.gov.au/nutrients amounts] you need. 
[[File:AD2009Aug13 Rubus 01.jpg|AD2009Aug13 Rubus 01|120px|right]]
Don't forget you can:
* Add FRUIT for a great natural source of many vitamins. 
* Add MILK or YOGHURT for a great natural source of calcium.

== Healthy breakfast ideas ==
You don't have to stick to one breakfast cereal, keep breakfast fun and mix it up!

      <text xml:space="preserve">===The Internet and the Web===

The Internet and the Web give us the ability to connect to countless resources and is molding the way our society utilizes technology for online storage and services. We will use principles previously learned to examine Internet and Web communication. The principles we will examine are: 
* information can be encoded into messages
* a coordination system is a set of agents interacting with each other toward a common objective
* messages can hide information

====Computer Networks====

A computer network is considered a communication sub-system that connects a group of computers enabling them to communicate with each other. When thinking of a computer network you must consider two parts that make it possible: 

'''Hardware:''' 
* network interface card (NIC) - required in order to connect to a local area network
* cabling or antennas - required to carry signals for transmission
* network switches - used to relay signals

'''Software:'''
* Programs - used to process information (bits) using algorithms

====Network Standard====

Similar to encoding procedures used for bits, the same idea of a standard must be used for networks. In order for communication to occur it requires a standard for devices, message format, and procedures of interactions. These standards provide ordered processes for communication. 

Once we have the standards in place we can examine what actually makes a network tick. As stated previously, a computer network is made of two parts: hardware and software. The physical hardware sets the way for communication to travel, but does not enable the network. The software (programs) are the pieces that make a computer network to allow software-to-software communication. 

The focus of this chapter will be on following three software standards: 
* the Internet protocol suite
* layers of software
* abstraction being used for simplification

====Background Definitions====

Knowing the definitions from the links provided will give you a foundation for the material in this chapter. 

====Stack of Protocols====

When analyzing the protocols needed to allow communication over a network, we see that different protocols are layered to create levels of abstraction. These abstraction layers are used both for the upper and lower layers (see image below).

[[File:Protocol Stacks.PNG|none|Shows the stack of network agents used to transmit a message from one computer to another.]]

'''Message Analogy'''

Let's say that Computer A wants to send a message to Computer B. Trace through the steps below to see how a message is sent via the two stacks of agents.

# Only A4 and B4 can access the physical mailboxes to send and receive packages
# A1 puts the message into packages 
# A2 adds sequence numbers and tracking numbers to packages
# A3 adds address labels
# A4 puts the packages in the outbox 
# packages arrive at B4’s inbox
# B3 accepts packages addressed to B
# B2 checks use sequence numbers to put the packages in order and acknowledges the packages using the tracking numbers to A2
# A2 re-sends a package unless acknowledged
# B1 opens the packages to reconstruct the original message

The network protocols work in the same way with A1 to A4 and B1 to B4 being software. The delivery mechanism used between A4 and B4 usually consists of metal wires, fiber optic cables, or radio waves in the air. 

'''Delivery Mechanism'''

Previously, we established how information is transmitted using Computer A and Computer B. Two delivery mechanisms that are used today for communication between networks are circuit switching and packet-switching. When you think about a telephone network, this network requires a connection is established before communication can occur. For example, when you call someone, the phone rings until the other person picks up or voicemail initiates; this type of communication is known as synchronous communication. 

The opposite is true for computer networks which use packet-switching. When using packet-switching, each packet (which is a small package of information) is individually addressed and delivered separately. The process mimics how mail packages are delivered via shared media, i.e. trucks, trains, ships, and airplanes. For instance, when you send a letter, you do not wait until the recipient is ready. This type of communication is called asynchronous communication.

====The Internet====

We have seen different standards and/or protocols of the Internet.The following describes the different characteristics of the Internet which will be important when distinguishing the Internet from the Web. 

* An infrastructure for communication (information highway)
* A global connection of computer networks using the Internet Protocol (IP)
* Uses layers of communication protocols: IP,TCP, HTTP/FTP/SSH
* Built on open standards: anyone can create a new internet device
* Lack of centralized control (mostly)
* Everyone can use it with simple, commonly available software

===The World Wide Web===

The World Wide Web is often confused with the Internet as it is used in conjunction with the Internet. The web is only one of the services provided through the Internet. It is important to know the characteristics of the Web (see below):

* A collection of distributed web pages or documents that can be fetched using the web protocol (HTTP-Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol)  
* A service (application) that uses the Internet as a delivery mechanism 
* Only one of the services that run on the Internet along with other services: email, file transfer, remote login, and etc.

====The Web====
There are two roles that work together to make up the web: Web servers and Web clients (browsers). 

'''Web servers'''
* Software that listens for web page requests and has access to stored web pages
* Apache, MS Internet Information Server (IIS)


'''Web clients (browsers)'''
* Software that fetches/displays documents fetched from web servers 
* Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari, Chrome

====Uniform Resource Locator (URL)====

The Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is an identifier for the location of a page on the web. The system of URLs is hierarchical (see image below).

[[File:Uniform Resource Locator (URL) example.PNG|center|An example of the different pieces of a URL.]]

* '''edu''': a URL for a school (not .com or .org)
* '''www.sbuniv.edu''': a URL for the Southwest Baptist University (SBU) website
* '''www.sbuniv.edu/COBACS/CIS/index.html''': a URL to a page on SBU’s website under the path

===Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML)===

The language used to define web pages is known as HTML. In order to view an example, open another tab and navigate to the [http://www.sbuniv.edu/COBACS/CIS/index.html%20 Southwest Baptist University CIS Department] website. Once you have the page open, right click on the page and select &quot;View Source&quot;, this will allow you to see the HTML code that was used to create the web page. The web page itself may content [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext hypertext] (clickable text that serves as links). A link is just a defined URL that points to another web page. Web pages and links are what combine to form the Web.   

===Finding Information on the Web===

It is important to note how to find information on the Web. Follow the steps below to see how this process works:
Use a hierarchical system (directory) to find the URLs to pages that may have the information
* Use our knowledge to guess, e.g. start from apple.com to navigate to the page for iPhone 5s
* Use a search engine  
    -we look for information (wherever it is located) not pages
    -we may find information we did not know existed

===How a Search Engine Works===

One of the main sources for locating resources can be found using a search engine. However, have you ever thought about how they actually work? There is a series of steps that describe exactly what happens when a search engine is used: 

# Gather information: crawl the web
# Keep copies: cache web pages
# Build an index
# Understand the query
# Determine the relevance of each possible result to the query
# Determine the ranking of the relevant results
# Present the results


'''Measure of Important Pages'''

Once a search is performed relevant pages are provided. However, not all relevant pages displayed are considered important. A web page does not gain importance until it has been ranked by credible sources. One of Google’s innovations is page rank - a measure of the “importance” of a page that takes into account the external references to it. A page is considered more important based on the number of important pages that link to that page. For example, an electronic article from the New York Times would have a higher level of importance or page rank than a personal blog due to the number of important pages linked to that online article.

== Introduction ==

Julia is a recent arrival to the world of programming languages, and has yet to accumulate a profusion of introductory texts. This will surely change. Soon we might see:

* Julia in 24 hours

* Learn Julia the Hard Way

* Julia for Dummies

* Julia for Fun and Profit

and many others. But until then, here’s a collection of notes and introductory paragraphs that comprise a gentle introduction to the Julia programming language, in the form of a wikibook.

The advantage and disadvantage of Wikibooks, apart from being free and open, is that anyone can edit anything at any time. In theory, a wikibook can only get better as more people add improvements and corrections. In practice, a wikibook may lose focus and consistency as it gains accuracy and coverage. But, because the Julia community has established a good ethos of encouraging participation in the development of the language, it's right that this wikibook is freely editable by everyone.

The [http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.3/ official Julia documentation] is excellent, although aimed more at the early adopters, developers, and more experienced programmers. Refer to it as often as possible.

Much of the text in this wikibook should work with the current version of Julia, which is, as of September 2014, version 0.3.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Getting started ===

To install Julia on your computer, visit http://julialang.org/downloads/ and follow instructions. If you’d rather use it online in a browser, visit [http://forio.com/julia/repl/].

====  On Mac OS X ====

On a Mac, you download the Julia DMG, double-click to open it, and drag the icon to the Applications folder. To run Julia, you double-click the icon of the Julia package in the /Applications folder. This opens the terminal application, and starts a new window. This is the REPL:

&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;$ julia
               _
   _       _ _(_)_     |  A fresh approach to technical computing
  (_)     | (_) (_)    |  Documentation: http://docs.julialang.org
   _ _   _| |_  __ _   |  Type &quot;help()&quot; to list help topics
  | | | | | | |/ _` |  |
  | | |_| | | | (_| |  |  Version 0.3.0-rc1+60 (2014-07-17 19:50 UTC)
 _/ |\__'_|_|_|\__'_|  |  Commit a327b47* (36 days old master)
|__/                   |  x86_64-apple-darwin13.3.0
julia&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

Alternatively, you can type, in a terminal,
    
    /Applications/Julia.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia

—here you’re specifying the path name of the Julia binary executable inside the Julia application bundle.

There are clever things you can do with paths and profiles, so that you can log in to a terminal and type &lt;tt&gt;julia&lt;/tt&gt; with immediate success.

After investigating the names of various files, I ended up adding this to my &lt;tt&gt;~/.bash_profile&lt;/tt&gt; file:
    
&lt;source lang=&quot;matlab&quot;&gt;    alias julia=&quot;/Applications/Julia-0.3.0.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia&quot;
    export PATH
&lt;/source&gt;

===== Running a script =====

If you want to write Julia code in an editor and run it, in true scripting-language fashion, you can. At the top of the script file, add a line like the following:

&lt;pre&gt;#!/Applications/Julia-0.3.0.app/Contents/Resources/julia/bin/julia&lt;/pre&gt;

where the pathname points to the right place on your system, somewhere inside the relevant Julia application bundle. This is the &lt;b&gt;shebang&lt;/b&gt; line.

Then you can run the script inside the editor in the same way that you'd run a Perl script.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== The REPL ===

The REPL is the Read/Evaluate/Print/Loop part of the language. It's an interactive command-line program that lets you type expressions in Julia code and see the results of the evaluation printed on the screen immediately. It:

* Reads what you type
* Evaluates it
* Prints out the return value, then 
* Loops back and does it all over again

To be honest, it's not the best environment to do serious programming work of any scale in — for that, a text editor, or interactive notebook environment (e.g. IJulia/IPython/Jupyter) is a better choice. But there are advantages to using the REPL: it's simple, should work without any installation or configuration, and you can even use it online, at http://forio.com/julia/repl/.

Here's a quick guide to finding your way around the REPL.

After typing some Julia code, press Return/Enter. You'll see the result returned by the evaluation of your typing:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt;42 &lt;Return/Enter&gt;
42
julia&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

If you don't complete the expression on the first line, continue typing. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; 2 +  &lt;Return/Enter&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

and Julia waits patiently until you finish the expression:

&lt;pre&gt;
2  &lt;Return/Enter&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

then you see the answer:

&lt;pre&gt;
4
julia&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Type a question mark &lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt; and you'll switch to Help mode.

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; ?  &lt;Return/Enter&gt;
Help?&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now you can type the name of something:

&lt;pre&gt;
help?&gt; quit
Base.quit()

Quit the program indicating that the processes completed
succesfully. This function calls &quot;exit(0)&quot; (see &quot;exit()&quot;).

julia&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
You could also use the &lt;tt&gt;help()&lt;/tt&gt; function,  and supply the name of another function between the parentheses:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt;help(quit)
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can try searching for anything (but use quotes because you're searching for a string, not a function):

&lt;pre&gt;
Julia&gt; apropos(&quot;quit&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

and see a list of matches.

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; apropos(&quot;quit&quot;)
Base.quit()
Base.exit([code])
Base.less(file::String[, line])
Base.less(function[, types])
Base.edit(file::String[, line])
Base.edit(function[, types])
&lt;/pre&gt;

The names or descriptions of all these functions contains the word &quot;quit&quot;, even though some won't be applicable or useful right now.

If you type a semicolon, you switch to shell mode:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt;;
&lt;/pre&gt;

In shell mode you can type any shell (ie non-Julia) command and see the result:

&lt;pre&gt;
shell&gt; ls

list of contents
julia&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

then the prompt switches back to &lt;tt&gt;julia&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. A semicolon is therefore needed before every shell command.

====Orientation====

Here are some other interactive functions available at the REPL prompt:

* &lt;tt&gt;whos()&lt;/tt&gt; - Print information about global symbols
* &lt;tt&gt;@which&lt;/tt&gt; - tells you which method will be called for a function and particular arguments:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; @which sin(3)
sin(x::Real) at math.jl:124
&lt;/pre&gt;

* &lt;tt&gt;versioninfo()&lt;/tt&gt; - Julia and package version information

* &lt;tt&gt;edit(&quot;filename in current directory&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt; - edit a file

* &lt;tt&gt;less(&quot;filename in current directory&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt;  -  displays a file

* &lt;tt&gt;clipboard(&quot;stuff&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt; copies &quot;stuff&quot; to the system clipboard

* &lt;tt&gt;clipboard()&lt;tt&gt;clipboard()&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; pastes the contents of the keyboard into the current REPL line

* &lt;tt&gt;dump()&lt;/tt&gt; displays information about a Julia object on the screen

* &lt;tt&gt;names()&lt;/tt&gt; shows the names in modules or types

==== The TAB key: autocompletion ====

The TAB key is usually able to complete — or suggest a completion for — something whose name you start typing. For example, if I type w and then press the TAB key, all the functions that are currently available beginning with 'w' are listed:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt;w &lt;TAB&gt;
w
wait                    whos                     with_rounding            writedlm
warn                    widemul                  workers                  writemime
watch_file              widen                    workspace                writesto
which                   with_bigfloat_precision  write                    wstring
while                   with_bigfloat_rounding   writecsv&lt;/pre&gt;

This works both for Julia entities and in shell mode. Here, for example, is how I could navigate to a directory and edit a file using shell commands:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; ;
shell&gt; cd ~
/Users/me
julia&gt;;
shell&gt; cd Doc TAB
expands to give
shell&gt;cd Documents/ 
julia&gt;;
shell&gt;ls&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember you can get help about these utility functions using &lt;tt&gt;help()&lt;/tt&gt;.

You can look back through the history of your previous typed input using the Up and Down keys. You don't have to type a long expression again if you can just recall it from history. And if you've typed loads of expressions, you can search back and forward by pressing Ctrl-R and Ctrl-S.

One warning about the REPL: You're going to be working at the global scope level of Julia. Usually, when writing longer code, you would put your code inside a function. There are some things that you can't do at the top level — such as specify types for the values of variables.

====Changing the prompt====

You can change the prompt from &lt;tt&gt;julia&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; to something else, such as &lt;tt&gt;&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. Type:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Base.active_repl.interface.modes[1].prompt=&quot;&gt; &quot;
&quot;&gt; &quot;

&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Using Julia as a calculator===

You can use Julia as a powerful calculator, using the REPL. It's good practice, too. (This is yet another tradition in introductions to interactive programming languages.)

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; 2 + 2
4
julia&gt; 2 + 3 + 4
9
&lt;/pre&gt;

An equivalent form for an addition is:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt;+(2, 2)
4
&lt;/pre&gt;

This shows that the operators that you usually use between values are in fact Julia functions, and can be used in the same way as other functions. Similarly:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; 2 + 3 + 4
9
&lt;/pre&gt;

can be written as

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; +(2, 3, 4)
9
&lt;/pre&gt;

and 

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; 2 * 3 * 4
24
&lt;/pre&gt;

can be written as

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; *(2,3,4)
24
&lt;/pre&gt;

Some maths constants are provided:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; pi
π = 3.1415926535897...
julia&gt; golden
φ = 1.6180339887498...
julia&gt; e
e = 2.7182818284590...
&lt;/pre&gt;

All the usual operators are provided: 

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; 2 + 3 - 4 * 5 / 6 % 7
1.6666666666666665
&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice the precedence of the operators. In this case it looks to be:

&lt;pre&gt;
(2 + 3) - (4 * 5 / 6 % 7)
&lt;/pre&gt;

You'll need parentheses to control the evaluation order:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt;(1 + sqrt(5)) / 2
1.618033988749895
&lt;/pre&gt;

Some others to watch out for include:

* &lt;tt&gt;^&lt;/tt&gt; power
* &lt;tt&gt;%&lt;/tt&gt; remainder

To make rational numbers, use two slashes (&lt;tt&gt;//&lt;/tt&gt;):

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; x = 666//999
2//3
&lt;/pre&gt;

There's also reverse division &quot;&lt;tt&gt;\&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;,  so that &lt;tt&gt;x/y&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;tt&gt;y\x&lt;/tt&gt;.

The standard arithmetic operators also have special updating versions, which you can use to update variables quickly:

* &lt;tt&gt;+=&lt;/tt&gt; 
* &lt;tt&gt;-=&lt;/tt&gt; 
* &lt;tt&gt;*=&lt;/tt&gt;  
* &lt;tt&gt;/=&lt;/tt&gt;  
* &lt;tt&gt;\=&lt;/tt&gt; 
* &lt;tt&gt;%=&lt;/tt&gt;  
* &lt;tt&gt;^=&lt;/tt&gt;

For example, after defining a variable x:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt;x = 5
5
&lt;/pre&gt;

you can add 2 to it like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt;x += 2
7
&lt;/pre&gt;

multiply it by 100 like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; x *= 100
700
&lt;/pre&gt;

and find its modulus 11 value:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; x %= 11
7
&lt;/pre&gt;

There are element-wise operators which work on arrays. This means that you can multiply two arrays element by element:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; [2,4] .* [10, 20]
2-element Array{Int64,1}:
20
80
&lt;/pre&gt;

Arrays are fundamental to Julia, and so have their own chapter in this book...

===  Number bases ===

Also useful for using Julia as a calculator, are some of these handy utility functions.
The &lt;tt&gt;bits()&lt;/tt&gt; function shows the literal binary representation of a number: 

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; bits(20.0)
&quot;0100000000110100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000&quot;

julia&gt; bits(20)
&quot;0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000010100&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

For working in bases other than the default 10, try &lt;tt&gt;hex()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;oct()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;

julia&gt; hex(65535)
&quot;ffff&quot;

julia&gt; oct(64)
&quot;100&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

and then there's &lt;tt&gt;base()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;digits()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;tt&gt;base(base, number)&lt;/tt&gt; converts a number to a string in the given base:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; base(16,255)
&quot;ff&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Whereas &lt;tt&gt;digits(number, base)&lt;/tt&gt; returns an array of the digits of number in the given base:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; digits(255,16)
2-element Array{Int64,1}:
15
15
julia&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's a good place to mention &lt;tt&gt;num2hex()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;hex2num()&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Variables===

In this expression:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; x = 3
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt; is a variable, a named storage location referring to data objects. In Julia, variables can be named pretty much how you like, although don't start variable names with numbers or punctuation. You can use Unicode characters, if you want. 

To assign a value, use a single equals sign.

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; a = 1
1
julia&gt; b = 2
2
julia&gt; c = 3
3
julia&gt; ✎ = 3
3
julia&gt; ✎
3 &lt;/pre&gt;

There are other ways of testing for equality.

Julia's very good at spotting variable names and numbers in expressions:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; x = 2
2
julia&gt; x^2+3x-1
9
&lt;/pre&gt;

You should avoid using names that Julia has already taken. For example, words like mean and median are used for imported function names, but Julia doesn't stop you redefining them — although you'll get a message warning you of possible problems ahead.

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; mean = 0
Warning: imported binding for mean overwritten in module Main
0
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you make this mistake, you can restore the original meaning like this, if &lt;tt&gt; mean&lt;/tt&gt; is a function in the Base module:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; mean = Base.mean
mean (generic function with 3 methods)
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can assign two variables at the same time:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; a, b = 5, 3
(5,3)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice that the return value of this expression is a parenthesis-bounded comma-separated ordered list of elements, or tuple for short.

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; a
5
julia&gt; b
3
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Special characters===

The Julia REPL provides easy access to special characters, such as Greek alphabetic characters, subscripts, and special maths symbols. If you type a backslash, you can type a string (usually the equivalent LATEX string) to insert the corresponding Unicode character. For example, if you type:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt;\sqrt TAB 42
&lt;/pre&gt;

Julia replaces the \sqrt with a square root symbol:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; √42 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Some other examples:

* \Gamma Γ
* \mercury ☿
* \degree °
* \cdot ⋅
* \in ∈

There's a full list in the Julia source code, which you can find at &lt;tt&gt;julia/latex_symbols.jl&lt;/tt&gt;. In Julia, you're encouraged to look at the source code, so there's useful built-in functions for looking at Julia source files:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt;less(&quot;/Applications/Julia-0.3.0.app/Contents/Resources/julia/share/julia/base/latex_symbols.jl&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

runs the file through a pager (ie the less command in Unix). If you're brave, try using &lt;tt&gt;edit()&lt;/tt&gt; rather than &lt;tt&gt;less()&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Maths functions ===

Because Julia is particularly suited for scientific and technical computing, there are many mathematical functions that you can use immediately — you don't have to  import them or use prefixes. 

The trig functions expect values in radians:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; sin(pi / 2)
1.0
&lt;/pre&gt;

but there are degree-based versions too: &lt;tt&gt;sind(90)&lt;/tt&gt; finds the sine of 90 degrees. Use &lt;tt&gt;deg2rad()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;rad2deg()&lt;/tt&gt; to convert between degrees and radians.

There are also log functions:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; log(12)
2.4849066497880004
&lt;/pre&gt;

and the accurate &lt;tt&gt;hypot()&lt;/tt&gt; function:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; hypot(3,4)

5.0
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;norm()&lt;/tt&gt; function returns the &quot;p&quot;-norm of a vector or the operator norm of a matrix.

Here's &lt;tt&gt;divrem()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; divrem(13,3) # returns the division and the remainder
(4,1)
&lt;/pre&gt;

There are dozens of others. Special functions include &lt;tt&gt;erf()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;dawson()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;eta()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;zeta()&lt;/tt&gt;, a full collection of Bessel functions, and so on.

In the statistics realm, all the basic statistics functions are available. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt;mean([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8])
4.5&lt;/pre&gt;

There's a system-wide variable called ans that remembers the most recent result, so that you can use it in the next expression.

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; 1*2*3*4*5
120
julia&gt; ans/10
12.0
&lt;/pre&gt;

Sometimes you don't want to see output from an expression. Add a semicolon at the end to hide the output:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; 2 + 2;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can check that the addition was done, by looking at the value of ans:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; ans
4
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Exercise===

Guess, then find out using &lt;tt&gt;help()&lt;/tt&gt;, what &lt;tt&gt;isprime()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;isapprox()&lt;/tt&gt;. 

Descriptions of all the functions provided as standard with Julia are described here:
[http://julia.readthedocs.org/en/latest/stdlib/base/#the-standard-library]

===  Random numbers ===

&lt;tt&gt;rand()&lt;/tt&gt; - one random Float64 between 0 and 1

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt;rand()
0.11258244478647295
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;rand(2,2)&lt;/tt&gt; - an array of Float64s with dimensions 2,2

&lt;tt&gt;rand(type, 2, 2)&lt;/tt&gt; - an array of values of this type with dims 2, 2

&lt;tt&gt;rand(range, dims)&lt;/tt&gt; - array of numbers in a range (including both ends) with specified dimensions:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; rand(0:10, 6)
6-element Array{Int64,1}:
6
7
9
6
3
10
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;randbool()&lt;/tt&gt; function generates one or more trues and falses:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; randbool()
false
julia&gt; randbool(20)
20-element BitArray{1}:
false
true
false
false
false
true
true
false
false
false
false
false
false
false
true
true
false
true
true
false&lt;/pre&gt;

====Random numbers in a distribution====

&lt;tt&gt;randn()&lt;/tt&gt; gives you one random number in a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. &lt;tt&gt;randn(n)&lt;/tt&gt; gives you n such numbers:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; randn()
0.8060073309441075
julia&gt; randn(20)
20-element Array{Float64,1}:
-0.53302
0.715804
-0.6723
0.236114
1.27232
0.169889
-0.266492
-0.651483
0.825705
2.90281
-0.989342
0.132774
1.07363
-0.0590167
1.54882
-0.326873
-0.258123
-0.724493
-0.827943
-0.803978
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you've installed the Gadfly plotting package, you can plot this:
&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; using Gadfly
julia&gt; p = plot(x=randn(2000), Geom.histogram(bincount=100))
&lt;/pre&gt;

[[File:Julia-histogram.png|histogram plot created in Julia using Gadfly]]

=== Seeding the random number generator ===
Before you use random numbers, you can seed the random number generator with a specific value. This ensures that subsequent random numbers will follow the same sequence, if they start from the same seed. You can seed the generator using the &lt;tt&gt;srand()&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;MersenneTwister()&lt;/tt&gt; functions.

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; srand(10)
julia&gt; rand(0:10, 6)
6-element Array{Int64,1}:
6
5
9
1
1
0
julia&gt; rand(0:10, 6)
6-element Array{Int64,1}:
10
3
6
8
0
1&lt;/pre&gt;

After restarting Julia, the same seed guarantees the same random numbers:

&lt;pre&gt;
exit()

      <text xml:space="preserve">==  Storage: Arrays and Tuples ==

In Julia, groups of items are stored in arrays, tuples, or dictionaries.

=== Arrays ===

An array is an ordered collection of elements. It's indicated with square brackets or — occasionally — curly braces. You can create arrays that are full or empty, and arrays that hold values of any type or restricted to values of a specific type.

In Julia, arrays are used for lists, vectors, and matrices. A one-dimensional array is a vector or list. A 2-D array can be thought of as a matrix. And 3-D and more-D arrays are similarly thought of as multi-dimensional matrices.

=== Creating simple arrays ===

Here's how to create a simple one dimensional array:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
5-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
&lt;/pre&gt;

Julia informs you that you've created an array with 5 elements, each of which are assumed to be of type Integer64, because the first element looked like an integer. If the first element looks like a floating-point number, you'll get an array of Float64s:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [1.0,2,3,4,5]
5-element Array{Float64,1}:
 1.0
 2.0
 3.0
 4.0
 5.0
&lt;/pre&gt;

Similarly for strings: 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [&quot;this&quot;, &quot;is&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, &quot;array&quot;, &quot;of&quot;, &quot;strings&quot;]
6-element Array{ASCIIString,1}:
 &quot;this&quot;
 &quot;is&quot;
 &quot;an&quot;
 &quot;array&quot;
 &quot;of&quot;
 &quot;strings&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

returns an array of strings, and:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [sin,cos,tan]
3-element Array{Function,1}:
 sin
 cos
 tan&lt;/pre&gt;
 
returns an array of functions.

To create an empty array, you can specify the type and the dimensions and use the &lt;tt&gt;Array()&lt;/tt&gt; type constructor function (notice that upper-case &quot;A&quot;):

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; array = Array(Int64,5)
5-element Array{Int64,1}:
 0
 0
 0
 0
 0
&lt;/pre&gt;

Arrays can of course have elements of different types:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [1,&quot;2&quot;, 3.0, sin, pi]
5-element Array{Any, 1}:
     1
      &quot;2&quot;
     3.0
      sin
 π = 3.1415926535897...
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here, the array also has five elements, but they're an odd mixture: numbers, strings, functions, constants — so Julia creates an array of type Any:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; typeof(ans)
Array{Any,1}
&lt;/pre&gt;

To create an array of a specific type, start the array definition with a type:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Int64[1, 2, 3, 4]
4-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you think you can fool Julia by sneaking in a value of the wrong type while declaring a typed array, you might get caught out:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Int64[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,  9, 10.0]
ERROR: InexactError()
 in setindex! at array.jl:307
 in getindex at array.jl:121&lt;/pre&gt;


If you leave out the commas when defining an array, Julia creates a single row, multi-column array — also called a row vector:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [1 2 3 4]
1x4 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  2  3  4
&lt;/pre&gt;

and you can use a semicolon to add another row:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [1 2 3 4 ; 5 6 7 8]
2x4 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Range objects ===

In Julia, the colon (&lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt;) has a number of uses. One use is to define ranges and sequences of integers. You can type it directly:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; 1:20
1:20
&lt;/pre&gt;

And you can use the &lt;tt&gt;range()&lt;/tt&gt; function to make a range object: 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; range(1,10)
1:10
&lt;/pre&gt;

It may not look very useful in that form, but it provides the raw material for any job in Julia that needs a range or sequence of numbers. For example, you can build an array consisting of those numbers, just by enclosing it in square brackets:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [1:10]
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
 10
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or you can use it in a loop expression:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for n in 1:10 print(n) end
12345678910
&lt;/pre&gt;

You don't have to start and finish on an integer either:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [3.5:9.5]
7-element Array{Float64,1}:
 3.5
 4.5
 5.5
 6.5
 7.5
 8.5
 9.5&lt;/pre&gt;
 
There's also a three-piece version of a range object which lets you specify a step size other than 1. This builds an array with elements that go from 0 to 100 in steps of 10:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [0:10:100]
11-element Array{Int64,1}:
   0
  10
  20
  30
  40
  50
  60
  70
  80
  90
 100
&lt;/pre&gt;
 
To go down instead of up, you'll have to use the middle step value:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [4:-1:1]
4-element Array{Int64,1}:
 4
 3
 2
 1
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Collecting up the values in a range ====

If you're not using your range object in a for loop, you can use &lt;tt&gt;collect()&lt;/tt&gt; to obtain all the values from a range object directly:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; collect(0:5:100)
21-element Array{Int64,1}:
   0
   5
  10
  15
  20
  25
  30
  35
  40
  45
  50
  55
  60
  65
  70
  75
  80
  85
  90
  95
 100&lt;/pre&gt;
 
(Although you could have used square brackets to build an array, in this case.)

===Custom range objects ===

Another useful function is &lt;tt&gt;linrange()&lt;/tt&gt;, which constructs a range object that goes from a start value to an end value taking a specific number of steps. You don't have to calculate the increment, Julia calculates the step size for you. For example, to go from 1 to 100 in exactly 12 steps:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; linrange(1,100,12)
1.0:9.0:100.0
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can use this range object to build an array:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [linrange(1,100,12)]
12-element Array{Float64,1}:
   1.0
  10.0
  19.0
  28.0
  37.0
  46.0
  55.0
  64.0
  73.0
  82.0
  91.0
 100.0&lt;/pre&gt;
 
Notice in passing that it provided you with a Float64 array, rather than an Integer array. 
Similar functions are &lt;tt&gt;linspace()&lt;/tt&gt; and a logarithmic version called &lt;tt&gt;logspace()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; logspace(1, 2, 5)
5-element Array{Float64,1}:
  10.0
  17.7828
  31.6228
  56.2341
 100.0
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Arrays, vectors, lists, and matrices ===

Compare these two: &lt;tt&gt;[1,2,3,4,5]&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;[1 2 3 4 5]&lt;/tt&gt;. 

With the commas, this array is a column vector, with 5 rows and 1 column:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
5-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
&lt;/pre&gt;

With the spaces, this array is a row vector, with 1 row and 5 columns:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [1 2 3 4 5]
1x5 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  2  3  4  5
&lt;/pre&gt;

With 2 dimensions, you can create matrices:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [1 2 3; 4 5 6]
2x3 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6
&lt;/pre&gt;

And of course you can create matrices with 3 or more dimensions.

=== Curly brace syntax ===

You can also use the curly braces to create arrays. 

They're like square brackets, but the resulting array is of type Any.

Compare:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; aany = {1,2,3,4}
4-element Array{Any,1}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
&lt;/pre&gt;

with

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; aarr = [1,2,3,4]
4-element Array{Int64,1}:
1
2
3
4&lt;/pre&gt;

The curly braces created an array of Any type, so you can change a value to another type without problems:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; aany[1] = &quot;One&quot;
&quot;One&quot;
julia&gt; aany
4-element Array{Any,1}:
  &quot;One&quot;
 2
 3
 4&lt;/pre&gt;
 
But you can't do this for the square-bracket-created array:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; aarr[1] = &quot;One&quot;
ERROR: `convert` has no method matching convert(::Type{Int64}, ::ASCIIString)
 in setindex! at array.jl:307
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Creating arrays ===

What you can't do is create a 2D array like this:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]
6-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
&lt;/pre&gt;

Julia massages it into a 6 element array. Instead, you can create a 2-D array by doing one of the following:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a = [1 2 3 ; 4 5 6]
2x3 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here, you use spaces instead of commas, and semicolons to indicate the start of a new row.

Alternatively, use the Array constructor:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Array[[1, 2], [3, 4]]
2-element Array{Array{T,N},1}:
 [1,2]
 [3,4]&lt;/pre&gt;
 

— notice that this doesn't look like a function, &lt;tt&gt;Array()&lt;/tt&gt;. It creates an array of arrays.

Here's another way:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Array(Int64, 3,2)
3x2 Array{Int64,2}:
 0  0
 0  0
 0  0&lt;/pre&gt;
 

Since there's a useful function for reshaping arrays, you can of course create an array and then change its shape:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; reshape([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8], 2, 4)
2x4 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  3  5  7
 2  4  6  8
&lt;/pre&gt;
 
 
The same techniques can be used to create 3D arrays. Here'a 3D array of strings:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Array(String,2,3,4)
2x3x4 Array{String,3}:
[:, :, 1] =
 #undef  #undef  #undef
 #undef  #undef  #undef


[:, :, 2] =
 #undef  #undef  #undef
 #undef  #undef  #undef


[:, :, 3] =
 #undef  #undef  #undef
 #undef  #undef  #undef


[:, :, 4] =
 #undef  #undef  #undef
 #undef  #undef  #undef&lt;/pre&gt;
 
Each element is &lt;tt&gt;#undef&lt;/tt&gt;.

If you have an existing array and want to copy it, you can use the &lt;tt&gt;similar()&lt;/tt&gt; function:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a = [1:10]
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
 10
julia&gt; b = similar(a)
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
 0
 0
 0
 0
 0
 0
 0
 0
 0
 0&lt;/pre&gt;
 
You can, though, change the type and dimensions anyway, so they don't have to be that similar:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; c = similar(b, String, (2, 2))
2x2 Array{String,2}:
 #undef  #undef
 #undef  #undef
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Creating and filling an array ===

There are a number of functions that let you create arrays with specific contents. 
We've seen that you can enclosed a range object (start, step, stop) in square brackets:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [0:10:100]
11-element Array{Int64,1}:
   0
  10
  20
  30
  40
  50
  60
  70
  80
  90
 100&lt;/pre&gt;

Some functions that you can use to make arrays with ready-to-use contents include &lt;tt&gt;zeros()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;ones()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;trues()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;falses()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;fill()&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;fill!()&lt;/tt&gt;: 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; zeros(2, 2)
2x2 Array{Float64,2}:
 0.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0

julia&gt; ones(Int64, (3, 3))
3x3 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  1  1
 1  1  1
 1  1  1&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;trues()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;falses()&lt;/tt&gt; functions do a similar job with the Boolean values true and false.

&lt;tt&gt;julia&gt; trues(3, 4)
3x4 BitArray{2}:
 true  true  true  true
 true  true  true  true
 true  true  true  true
&lt;/tt&gt;

You can use &lt;tt&gt;fill()&lt;/tt&gt; to create an array with a specific value:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; fill(&quot;hi&quot;, 2, 2)
2x2 Array{ASCIIString,2}:
 &quot;hi&quot;  &quot;hi&quot;
 &quot;hi&quot;  &quot;hi&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

With &lt;tt&gt;fill!()&lt;/tt&gt;, the exclamation mark (&lt;tt&gt;!&lt;/tt&gt;) or &quot;bang&quot; is to warn you that you're about to change the contents of an existing array (a useful indication that's adopted throughout Julia). Let's change an array of falses to trues:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; trueArray = falses(3,3)
3x3 BitArray{2}:
 false  false  false
 false  false  false
 false  false  false
julia&gt; fill!(trueArray, true)
3x3 BitArray{2}:
 true  true  true
 true  true  true
 true  true  true
julia&gt; trueArray
3x3 BitArray{2}:
 true  true  true
 true  true  true
 true  true  true&lt;/pre&gt;
 
If you'd prefer a random number in each cell of a new array, use &lt;tt&gt;rand()&lt;/tt&gt; followed by the required dimensions:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; rand(2,3)
2x3 Array{Float64,2}:
 0.662843  0.445892  0.439851
 0.121989  0.048896  0.870163
&lt;/pre&gt;

or use &lt;tt&gt;randn()&lt;/tt&gt; for normally distributed numbers:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; randn(20,3)
20x3 Array{Float64,2}:
 -0.728709    -0.391909  -1.13824
  1.2293      -0.829367  -1.06711
  2.26544     -1.5573    -0.444163
  0.00163927  -0.987814  -0.887405
 -0.595679     1.45497   -0.651611
 -0.690074    -1.96845   -2.57402
 -0.705386     1.0319    -0.884835
  0.0640004    0.622827  -1.10468
  0.640549    -1.98737   -0.586064
 -2.14224     -0.129388  -1.50473
 -0.0834891    0.600715   3.00035

Here's the identity matrix, I (&quot;eye&quot;!):

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; eye(3, 3)
3x3 Array{Float64,2}:
 1.0  0.0  0.0
 0.0  1.0  0.0
 0.0  0.0  1.0
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can use &lt;tt&gt;linspace()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;logspace()&lt;/tt&gt; functions to create vector-like arrays, then use &lt;tt&gt;reshape()&lt;/tt&gt; to make them into 2D arrays. &lt;tt&gt;linspace(start, end, steps)&lt;/tt&gt; goes from start to end in steps steps.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; reshape(linspace(0, 100, 30), 10, 3)
10x3 Array{Float64,2}:
  0.0      34.4828   68.9655
  3.44828  37.931    72.4138
  6.89655  41.3793   75.8621
 10.3448   44.8276   79.3103
 13.7931   48.2759   82.7586
 17.2414   51.7241   86.2069
 20.6897   55.1724   89.6552
 24.1379   58.6207   93.1034
 27.5862   62.069    96.5517
 31.0345   65.5172  100.0&lt;/pre&gt;
 
So this gives a 10 by 3 array featuring evenly spaced numbers between 0 and 100.

The &lt;tt&gt;logspace(a, b, n)&lt;/tt&gt; creates a logarithmically-spaced array of n numbers between 10^a and 10^b. Here, the &lt;tt&gt;int()&lt;/tt&gt; function converts the numbers in the 5 by 4 array to integers.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; int(reshape(logspace(0, 10, 20), 5, 4))
5x4 Array{Int64,2}:
   1    428    183298     78475997
   3   1438    615848    263665090
  11   4833   2069138    885866790
  38  16238   6951928   2976351442
 127  54556  23357215  10000000000
&lt;/pre&gt;
 
You can make a diagonal matrix and put 1s in every diagonal slot, using &lt;tt&gt;diagm()&lt;/tt&gt;. For example, put 1 into the diagonal of a 6 by 6 matrix:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; diagm([1,1,1,1,1,1])
6x6 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  0  0  0  0  0
 0  1  0  0  0  0
 0  0  1  0  0  0
 0  0  0  1  0  0
 0  0  0  0  1  0
 0  0  0  0  0  1
&lt;/pre&gt;
 
====  Curly braces ====

Using curly braces instead of square brackets is a shorthand notation for an array of type Any.

=== Accessing the contents of an array ===

To access the elements of an array, type the name of the array, followed by the element number in square brackets. Here's a 1D array:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a = [10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100]
&lt;/pre&gt;

The fifth element:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a[5]
10
&lt;/pre&gt;

The first element is index number 1. Julia is one of the languages that starts indexing elements in lists and arrays starting at 1, rather than 0. (And thus it's in the elite company of Matlab, Mathematica, Fortran, Lua, and Smalltalk, while most of the other programming languages are firmly in the opposite camp of 0-based indexers.)

Here's a 2D array:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a2 = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
3x3 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6
 7  8  9
julia&gt; a2[1]
1
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you just ask for one element of a 2D array, you'll receive the second element as if the array is unwound column by column, i.e. down first, then across: 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a2[2]
4
&lt;/pre&gt;

Asking for row and column works as you expect:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a2[1,2]
2
&lt;/pre&gt;

which is row 1, column 2. Row 1, column 3:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a2[1,3]
3
&lt;/pre&gt;

but don't get the row/column indices wrong:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a2[1,4]
ERROR: BoundsError()
 in getindex at array.jl:247
&lt;/pre&gt;

The error message here is another reminder that the square brackets are just another way of calling the &lt;tt&gt;getindex()&lt;/tt&gt; function:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; getindex(a2, 1,3)
3
julia&gt; getindex(a2, 1,4)
ERROR: BoundsError()
 in getindex at array.jl:247
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Setting the contents of arrays ===

To set the contents of an array, specify the indices on the right hand side of an assignment expression:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a = [1:10]
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
 10
julia&gt; a[9]= -9
-9
&lt;/pre&gt;

To check if the array has really changed:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; print(a)
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,-9,10]
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can set a bunch of elements at the same time:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a[3:6] = -5
-5
julia&gt; print(a)
[1,2,-5,-5,-5,-5,7,8,-9,10]
&lt;/pre&gt;

And you can assign a sequence of elements to a sequence of values:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a[3:9] = [9:-1:3]
7-element Array{Int64,1}:
 9
 8
 7
 6
 5
 4
 3
&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice here that, although Julia shows the 7 element slice as the return value, in fact the whole array has been modified:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
  1
  2
  9
  8
  7
  6
  5
  4
  3
 10
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can set ranges to a single value:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a[1:10] = -1
-1
julia&gt; print(a)
[-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1]
&lt;/pre&gt;

By the way, there's a function call that does the job of setting array contents:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; setindex!(a,1:10,10:-1:1)
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
 10
  9
  8
  7
  6
  5
  4
  3
  2
  1
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Filling arrays ===

&lt;tt&gt;fill!()&lt;/tt&gt; can fill arrays with a single value:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; fill!(a, 0);
julia&gt; print(a)
[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Finding items in arrays ===

If you want to know whether an array contains an item, use the &lt;tt&gt;in()&lt;/tt&gt; function, which can be called in two ways:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a = [1:10];
julia&gt; 3 in a
true
&lt;/pre&gt;

This can also be phrased as a function call:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; in(3, a)
true
&lt;/pre&gt;

There's a set of functions starting with '''find''' — such as &lt;tt&gt;find()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;findfirst()&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;findnext()&lt;/tt&gt; — that you can use to get the index or indices of array cells that match a specific value, or pass a test:
   
Here's an array of primes (including 1, because it looks better):

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; primes = [1,2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23]
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
  1
  2
  3
  5
  7
 11
 13
 17
 19
 23
&lt;/pre&gt;

To find the first occurrence of a number, and obtain its index, use &lt;tt&gt;findfirst()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; findfirst(primes,13)
7
&lt;/pre&gt;

so the seventh cell of the array equals 13:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; primes[7]
13
&lt;/pre&gt;

Using a function, you can use the same function with different arguments (&lt;tt&gt;find(function, array)&lt;/tt&gt;) to return a new array containing the index number of every cell where the function returns true when applied to the value:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; find(isinteger, primes)
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
 10

julia&gt; find(iseven, primes)
1-element Array{Int64,1}:
 2
&lt;/pre&gt;
 
These are arrays of indexes, not the actual cell values. The indexes can be used to extract the corresponding values using the standard square bracket syntax:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; primes[find(isodd,primes)]
9-element Array{Int64,1}:
  1
  3
  5
  7
 11
 13
 17
 19
 23
&lt;/pre&gt;
  
The &lt;tt&gt;findfirst()&lt;/tt&gt; version returns a single number — the index of the matching cell:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; findfirst(iseven, primes)
2

julia&gt; primes[findfirst(iseven, primes)]
2
&lt;/pre&gt;

Anonymous functions are useful here:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; find(r -&gt; r &gt; 10 &amp;&amp; r &lt; 20, primes)
4-element Array{Int64,1}:
 6
 7
 8
 9
&lt;/pre&gt;
 
Here, the anonymous function sets the variable &lt;tt&gt;r&lt;/tt&gt; to each value of the &lt;tt&gt;primes&lt;/tt&gt; array in turn, then tests &lt;tt&gt;r&lt;/tt&gt; to see if it's both less than 20 and greater than 10. If it is, the function returns true, and the index of the cell is added to the result. 

The &lt;tt&gt;findnext()&lt;/tt&gt; function is very similar to the &lt;tt&gt;find()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;findfirst()&lt;/tt&gt; functions, but accepts an additional number that tells the functions to start the search from somewhere in the middle of the array, rather than from the beginning. For example, if &lt;tt&gt;findfirst(primes,13)&lt;/tt&gt; finds the index of the first occurrence of the number 13 in the array, we can continue the search from there by using this value in &lt;tt&gt;findnext()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; findnext(isodd, primes, 1 + findfirst(primes,13))
8

julia&gt; primes[ans]
17
&lt;/pre&gt;

====Filtering====

There's a set of related functions that let you work on an array's elements. &lt;tt&gt;filter()&lt;/tt&gt; removes elements that fail to satisfy a test. It's not so much a coffee filter (which keeps what you don't want), and more of a fishing net, which keeps what you do want. Here, use the &lt;tt&gt;isprime()&lt;/tt&gt; function (as a named function without parentheses, rather than a function call with parentheses) to filter (keep) everything in the array that's prime.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; filter(isprime, [1:100])
25-element Array{Int64,1}:
  2
  3
  5
  7
 11
 13
 17
 19
 23
 29
 31
 37
 41
 43
 47
 53
 59
 61
 67
 71
 73
 79
 83
 89
 97&lt;/pre&gt;
 
Like many Julia functions, there's a version which changes the array. So &lt;tt&gt;filter()&lt;/tt&gt; returns a modified copy of the original, but &lt;tt&gt;filter!()&lt;/tt&gt; changes the array.

The &lt;tt&gt;count()&lt;/tt&gt; function is like &lt;tt&gt;filter()&lt;/tt&gt;, but just counts the number of elements that satisfy the condition:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; count(isprime, [1:100])
25
&lt;/pre&gt;

Also, the &lt;tt&gt;any()&lt;/tt&gt; function just tells you whether any of the elements satisfy the condition:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; any(isprime, [1:100])
true
&lt;/pre&gt;

and the &lt;tt&gt;all()&lt;/tt&gt; function tells you whether all of the elements satisfy the condition. Here, &lt;tt&gt;all()&lt;/tt&gt; checks to see whether &lt;tt&gt;filter()&lt;/tt&gt; did the job properly.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; all(isprime, filter(isprime, [1:100]))
true
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Other tests ===

The following functions are useful for working on numeric arrays:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; maximum(a)
10
julia&gt; minimum(a)
1
julia&gt; extrema(a)
(1,10)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;findmax()&lt;/tt&gt; finds the maximum element and returns it and its index in a tuple:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; findmax(a)
(10,10)
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can calculate the sum of elements:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; sum(a)
55
&lt;/pre&gt;

and the product of elements:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; prod(a)
3628800
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Joining arrays ===

&lt;tt&gt;union()&lt;/tt&gt; builds the union of two arrays.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
 10
julia&gt; b = [20:30]
11-element Array{Int64,1}:
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30
julia&gt; union(a, b)
21-element Array{Int64,1}:
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
 10
 20
 21
 22
 23
 24
 25
 26
 27
 28
 29
 30&lt;/pre&gt;
 
&lt;tt&gt;intersect()&lt;/tt&gt; finds the intersection of two arrays:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; intersect([1:10], [5:15])
6-element Array{Int64,1}:
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
 10
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Finding out about an array ===

With our 2D array:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a2 = [1 2 3; 4 5 6; 7 8 9]
3x3 Array{Int64,2}:
 1  2  3
 4  5  6
 7  8  9
&lt;/pre&gt;

we can find out more about it using the following functions:

* &lt;tt&gt;ndims()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;size()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;length()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;countnz()&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;ndims()&lt;/tt&gt; returns the number of dimensions, ie 1 for a vector, 2 for a table, and so on:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; ndims(a2)
2
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;size()&lt;/tt&gt; returns the row and column count of the array, in the form of a tuple:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; size(a2)
(3,3)
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;length()&lt;/tt&gt; tells you how many elements the array contains:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; length(a2)
9
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;countnz()&lt;/tt&gt; tells you how many non-zero elements there are:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; countnz(a2)
9
&lt;/pre&gt;

There are two related functions for converting between row/column numbers and array index numbers, &lt;tt&gt;ind2sub()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;sub2ind()&lt;/tt&gt;. Row 1, Column 1 is easy, of course - it's element 1, But Row 3, Column 7 is harder to work out. &lt;tt&gt;ind2sub()&lt;/tt&gt; takes the total rows and columns, and a element index. For example, &lt;tt&gt;ind2sub(size(a2), 5)&lt;/tt&gt; returns the row and column for the fifth element, in the form of a tuple:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; ind2sub(size(a2), 5)
(2,2)
&lt;/pre&gt;

With a loop, you could look at the row/column numbers of every element in an array: 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for i in 1:length(a2)
       println(ind2sub(size(a2), i), &quot; &quot;, a2[i])
       end
(1,1)	 1
(2,1) 4
(3,1)	 7
(1,2)	 2
(2,2)	 5
(3,2)	 8
(1,3)	 3
(2,3)	 6
(3,3)	 9
&lt;/pre&gt;

To go in the reverse direction, use sub2ind(). 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a2[sub2ind((3,3), 2, 1)]
&lt;/pre&gt;

finds you the element at row 2, column 1, for an array with dimensions (3,3).

=== Modifying arrays ===

To add an item at the end of an array, use &lt;tt&gt;push!()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; push!(a, 20)
11-element Array{Int64,1}:
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
 10
 20
&lt;/pre&gt;

As usual, the exclamation mark reminds you that this function will change the array.

To add an item at the front, use the oddly-named &lt;tt&gt;unshift!()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; unshift!(a, 0)
12-element Array{Int64,1}:
  0
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
 10
 20
&lt;/pre&gt;

To remove the last item:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; pop!(a)
20
&lt;/pre&gt;

and the first:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; shift!(a)
0
&lt;/pre&gt;

More aggressive modification of arrays (and similar data structures) can be made with functions such as &lt;tt&gt;deleteat!()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;splice!()&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;deleteat!()&lt;/tt&gt; deletes an element:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; deleteat!([1:10],3)
9-element Array{Int64,1}:
  1
  2
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
 10
&lt;/pre&gt;

To insert an element into an array at a given index, use the &lt;tt&gt;splice!()&lt;/tt&gt; function. For example, here's a list of numbers with an obvious omission:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a = [1,2,3,5,6,7,8,9]
8-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 2
 3
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
&lt;/pre&gt;

Use &lt;tt&gt;splice!()&lt;/tt&gt; to insert a sequence at a specific index. Julia returns the values that were replaced. Let's insert the numbers 4:6 at index position 4, currently occupied by the number 5:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; splice!(a, 4:5, [4:6])
2-element Array{Int64,1}:
 5
 6
&lt;/pre&gt;

and you can check that the new values were inserted correctly:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a
9-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
&lt;/pre&gt;

Without a replacement, &lt;tt&gt;splice!()&lt;/tt&gt; just removes elements and moves the rest of them along.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a = [1:10]; splice!(a,5); a
9-element Array{Int64,1}:
  1
  2
  3
  4
  6
  7
  8
  9
 10
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here are even more array-modifying functions:

* &lt;tt&gt;resize!()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;append!()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;prepend!()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;empty!(a)&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;rot90r(a)&lt;/tt&gt; to rotate an array 90 degrees clockwise:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; rotr90([1 2 3;4 5 6])
3x2 Array{Int64,2}:
 4  1
 5  2
 6  3
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to do something to an array, there's probably a function to do it, and sometimes with an exclamation mark to remind you of the potential consequences.

== Tuples ==

A tuple is an ordered sequence of elements, like an array. A tuple is represented by parentheses and commas, rather than the square brackets used by arrays.
The important difference between arrays and tuples is that tuples are immutable. You can't change a tuple once you've got one.

Tuples are mostly good for very small fixed-length collections — they're used everywhere for argument lists and for returning multiple values.

Other than setting the contents, tuples work in much the same way as arrays.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; t = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10)
(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
julia&gt; t
(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10)
julia&gt; t[1:3]
(1,2,3)
&lt;/pre&gt;

But you can't do this:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; t[1] = 0
ERROR: `setindex!` has no method matching setindex!(::(Int64,Int64,Int64,Int64,Int64,Int64,Int64,Int64,Int64,Int64), ::Int64, ::Int64)
&lt;/pre&gt;

And, because you can't modify tuples, you can't use any of the functions like &lt;tt&gt;push!()&lt;/tt&gt; that you use with arrays:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a = [1,2,3]
3-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 2
 3
julia&gt; push!(a,4)
4-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 2
 3
 4
julia&gt; t = (1,2,3)
(1,2,3)
julia&gt; push!(t,4)
ERROR: `push!` has no method matching push!(::(Int64,Int64,Int64), ::Int64)
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Functions ==

Functions are the building blocks of Julia code, acting as the subroutines, procedures, blocks, functions, and similar structural concepts found in other programming languages.

A function's job is to take a tuple of values as an argument list and return a value. If the arguments contain mutable values like arrays, the array can be modified inside the function. 

There are various syntaxes for defining functions:

* when the function contains a single expression
* when the function contain multiple expressions
* when the function doesn't need a name

=== Single expression functions ===

To define a simple function, all you need to do is provide a single expression involving the variables in the argument list:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; f(x, y) = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
f (generic function with 2 methods)
&lt;/pre&gt;

To call the function:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; f(3,4)
5.0
&lt;/pre&gt;

(By the way, there's already a &lt;tt&gt;hypot()&lt;/tt&gt; function in the standard library, which is better because it avoids subtle mathematical errors.)

===  Functions with multiple expressions ===

The syntax for defining a function with more than one expression is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;function functionname(arg1, arg2)
  an expression
  another expression
  more expressions
  the final expression
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's a typical function, that calls two other functions, and then ends.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; function breakfast()
   maketoast()
   brewcoffee()
end

breakfast (generic function with 1 method)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Whatever the value returned by the &lt;tt&gt;brewcoffee()&lt;/tt&gt; function, that value is also returned by the &lt;tt&gt;breakfast()&lt;/tt&gt; function.

Use the &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; keyword to indicate a specific value to be returned:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; function payBills(bankBalance)
   if bankBalance &lt; 0
       return false
   else
      return true
   end
end
payBills (generic function with 1 method)
julia&gt; payBills(20)
true
julia&gt; payBills(-10)
false
&lt;/pre&gt;

Later we'll learn how to make sure that the function doesn't go adrift if you call it with the wrong type of argument.

====  Returning more than one value from a function ====

To return more than one value from a function, use a tuple.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; function doublesix()
       (6,6)
end
doublesix (generic function with 1 method)
julia&gt; doublesix()
(6,6)
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Optional arguments and variable number of arguments ===

You can define functions with optional arguments, so that the function can use sensible defaults if specific values aren't supplied. You provide a default symbol and value in the argument list:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; function xyzpos(x, y, z=0)
           println(&quot;$x, $y, $z&quot;)
       end
xyzpos (generic function with 2 methods)
&lt;/pre&gt;

And when you call the function, if you don't provide a third value, the symbol z defaults to 0 and uses that value inside the function.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; xyzpos(1,2)
1, 2, 0
julia&gt; xyzpos(1,2,3)
1, 2, 3
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Keyword and positional arguments ===

The problem with writing functions like this:

&lt;pre&gt;function f(p, q, r, s, t, u)
end&lt;/pre&gt;

is that you'll forget the order in which you have to supply the arguments. Was it:

&lt;pre&gt; f(&quot;42&quot;, -2.123, atan2, &quot;obliquity&quot;, 42, 'x')&lt;/pre&gt;

or

&lt;pre&gt; f(-2.123, 42, 'x', &quot;42&quot;, &quot;obliquity&quot;, atan2)&lt;/pre&gt;

You can avoid this problem by using keywords to label arguments. Use a semicolon after the function's unlabelled arguments, and follow it with one or more &lt;tt&gt;keyword=value&lt;/tt&gt; pairs:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; function f(p, q ; r = 4, s = &quot;hello&quot;)
  println(&quot;p is $p&quot;)
  println(&quot;q is $q&quot;)
  return [&quot;r&quot;=&gt;r,&quot;s&quot;=&gt;s]
end
f (generic function with 1 method)
&lt;/pre&gt;

When called, this function expects two items in x and y, and will also accept a number and a string, labelled s1 and v1. If you don't supply them, the default values are used:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; f(1,2)
x is 1
y is 2
Dict{ASCIIString,Any} with 2 entries:
  &quot;s1&quot; =&gt; &quot;hello&quot;
  &quot;v1&quot; =&gt; 4
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you supply a keyword argument, it can be anywhere in the argument list, not just at the end or in the matching place. 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; f(v1=999,1,2)
x is 1
y is 2
Dict{ASCIIString,Any} with 2 entries:
  &quot;s1&quot; =&gt; &quot;hello&quot;
  &quot;v1&quot; =&gt; 999
julia&gt; f(s1=&quot;hello world&quot;,v1=999,1,2)
x is 1
y is 2
Dict{ASCIIString,Any} with 2 entries:
  &quot;s1&quot; =&gt; &quot;hello world&quot;
  &quot;v1&quot; =&gt; 999
julia&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

When defining the function, remember to insert a semicolon before the keyword/value pairs. 

Here's another example from the Julia manual. The &quot;rtol&quot; keyword can appear anywhere in the list of arguments:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; isapprox(3.0, 3.01, rtol=0.1)
true
julia&gt; isapprox(rtol=0.1, 3.0, 3.01)
true
&lt;/pre&gt;

A function definition can combine all the different kinds of arguments:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; function f(a1, opta2=2; key=&quot;foo&quot;)
   println(&quot;normal argument: $a1&quot;)
   println(&quot;optional argument: $opta2&quot;)
   println(&quot;keyword argument: $key&quot;)
end
f (generic function with 2 methods)
julia&gt; f(1)
normal argument: 1
optional argument: 2
keyword argument: foo
julia&gt; f(key=3, 1)
normal argument: 1
optional argument: 2
keyword argument: 3
julia&gt; f(key=3, 2, 1)
normal argument: 2
optional argument: 1
keyword argument: 3&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Functions with variable number of arguments ===

Functions can be defined to take any number of arguments:

&lt;pre&gt;function fvar(args...)
       println(&quot;you supplied $(length(args)) arguments&quot;)
       for arg in args
       	println(&quot; argument &quot;, arg)
       end
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

The three dots indicate a &lt;b&gt;splat&lt;/b&gt;.

You can call this function with any number of arguments:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; fvar()
you supplied 0 arguments
julia&gt; fvar(64)
you supplied 1 arguments
 argument 64
julia&gt; fvar(64,65)
you supplied 2 arguments
 argument 64
 argument 65
julia&gt; fvar(64,65,66)
you supplied 3 arguments
 argument 64
 argument 65
 argument 66
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Anonymous functions===

Sometimes you don't want to worry about thinking up a cool name for a function. Anonymous functions — functions with no name — can be used in a number of places in Julia, such as with &lt;tt&gt;map()&lt;/tt&gt;, and in list comprehensions.

The syntax uses &lt;tt&gt;-&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, like this:

&lt;pre&gt;x -&gt; x^2 + 2x - 1&lt;/pre&gt;

which defines a nameless function that takes a value, calls it x, and produces x^2 + 2x - 1. 

For the &lt;tt&gt;map()&lt;/tt&gt; function, for example, the first argument is a function, and you can define a one-off function that exists just for this particular &lt;tt&gt;map()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt; julia&gt; map(x -&gt; x^2 + 2x - 1, [1,3,-1])
3-element Array{Int64,1}:
  2
 14
 -2
&lt;/pre&gt;

After the &lt;tt&gt;map()&lt;/tt&gt; finishes, the function has disappeared whence it came:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; x
ERROR: x not defined
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want a function that has more than one argument, enclose the arguments in a tuple:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; map((x,y,z) -&gt; x + y + z, [1,2,3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9])
3-element Array{Int64,1}:
 12
 15
 18
&lt;/pre&gt;

Also, anonymous functions can have zero arguments, if you use &lt;tt&gt;()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; random = () -&gt; rand(0:10)
(anonymous function)
julia&gt; random()
3
julia&gt; random()
1
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Methods ===

A function can have one or more different methods for doing the same job. Each method concentrates on doing the job for a particular type of argument.

After entering this code in the REPL:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; function payBills(bankBalance)
       if bankBalance &lt; 0
           return false
       else
          return true
       end
       end
payBills (generic function with 1 method)
&lt;/pre&gt;

the message tells you that currently there is just one way you can call &lt;tt&gt;payBills()&lt;/tt&gt; — by passing it a number (the value of your bank balance) as the argument.

Now suppose you try to pass a string as the argument, such as a &quot;pay it now&quot; string:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; payBills(&quot;now&quot;)
ERROR: `isless` has no method matching isless(::ASCIIString, ::Int64)
 in payBills at none:2 
&lt;/pre&gt;

The error tells us that the function can't carry on, because the concept of less than, which we're using inside our function, makes no sense if the first argument is a string, and the second argument is an integer. Strings aren't less than or greater than integers, they're two separate things. So the function fails at that point.

Notice that the &lt;tt&gt;paybills()&lt;/tt&gt; function did start executing, though. The argument bankBalance could have been anything - a string, a floating point number, an integer. 

This is not always the best way to write code.

An improvement to our function is to specify that the bankBalance argument must be some kind of number:

&lt;pre&gt; julia&gt; function payBills(bankBalance::Number)
                     if bankBalance &lt; 0
                         return false
                     else
                        return true
                     end
              end
payBills (generic function with 1 method)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now the function avoids trying to apply &lt;tt&gt;&lt;&lt;/tt&gt; on arguments that aren't numbers. And using a type such as Number means we can call this particular method with a argument, if it's a kind of number. We can use the &lt;tt&gt;applicable()&lt;/tt&gt; function to test it. &lt;tt&gt;applicable()&lt;/tt&gt; lets you know whether you can apply a function to a value:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; applicable(payBills, 3)
true

julia&gt; applicable(payBills, 3.14)
true

julia&gt; applicable(payBills, pi)
true

julia&gt; applicable(payBills, 22//7)
true

julia&gt; applicable(payBills, -5)
true

julia&gt; applicable(payBills, &quot;now&quot;)
false
&lt;/pre&gt;

and the false indicates that you can't pass a string value to this method:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; payBills(&quot;now&quot;)
ERROR: `payBills` has no method matching payBills(::ASCIIString)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now, the body of the function isn't even looked at — Julia doesn't know a method for calling &lt;tt&gt;payBills()&lt;/tt&gt; with a string argument, she just knows a method with numeric arguments.

The next step perhaps is to define another method for the &lt;tt&gt;paybills()&lt;/tt&gt; function, only this time one that accepts a string argument. And functions can be given a number of separate methods: one for numeric arguments, one for string arguments, and so on. Julia selects and runs one of the  methods depending on what types you're dealing with.

You can use the built-in &lt;tt&gt;methods()&lt;/tt&gt; function to find out how many methods you've defined for a particular function. A good example is to see how many different ways you can use the &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; operator in Julia:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; methods(+)
&lt;/pre&gt;

which prints a list of every method that the &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; function owns. There are over 100 different types of thing that you can add together. 

===  Map and apply ===

If you already have a function and an array, you can call the function for every element of the array by using &lt;tt&gt;map()&lt;/tt&gt;. This &quot;maps&quot; a function onto every element of an array:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; map(sin, a)
10-element Array{Float64,1}:
  0.841471
  0.909297
  0.14112
 -0.756802
 -0.958924
 -0.279415
  0.656987
  0.989358
  0.412118
 -0.544021
&lt;/pre&gt;

And there's &lt;tt&gt;map!(sin, a)&lt;/tt&gt; to make the change to the numbers in the array permanent. 

Of course, you don't actually need to use &lt;tt&gt;map()&lt;/tt&gt; to apply &lt;tt&gt;sin()&lt;/tt&gt; to every member of an array. In fact, compare the timings of the &lt;tt&gt;map()&lt;/tt&gt; version to the standard &quot;apply a function to every member of the array&quot; version:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; @time map(sin,[1:10000]);
elapsed time: 0.023442818 seconds (472120 bytes allocated, 97.43% gc time)
julia&gt; @time sin([1:10000]);
elapsed time: 0.000293766 seconds (160200 bytes allocated)
&lt;/pre&gt;

There's also an &lt;tt&gt;apply()&lt;/tt&gt; function, which takes a list of arguments and a function, and calls the function with the arguments.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; f(x,y)  = x^2 + y^2
f (generic function with 1 method)
julia&gt; f(3,4)
25
&lt;/pre&gt;

and you can also do this:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; apply(f,[3,4])
25
&lt;/pre&gt;

but this is another way of saying this:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; f([3,4]...)
25
&lt;/pre&gt;

which is the &quot;splat&quot; you might hear about.

===  Functions that return functions ===

You can treat Julia functions in the same way as any other Julia object, particularly when it comes to returning them as the result of other functions.

For example, let's create a function-making function. Inside this function, a function called &lt;tt&gt;newfunction&lt;/tt&gt; is created, and this will raise its argument (y) to the number that was originally passed in as the argument x. This new function is returned as the value of the &lt;tt&gt;create_exponent_function()&lt;/tt&gt; function. 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; function create_exponent_function(x)
          newfunction = function (y) return y^x end
          return newfunction
       end
create_exponent_function (generic function with 1 method)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we can construct lots of exponent functions. First, let's build a &lt;tt&gt;squarer()&lt;/tt&gt; function:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; squarer = create_exponent_function(2)
(anonymous function)
&lt;/pre&gt;

and a &lt;tt&gt;cuber()&lt;/tt&gt; function:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; cuber = create_exponent_function(3)
(anonymous function)
&lt;/pre&gt;

While we're at it, let's do a &quot;raise to the power of 4&quot; function (called quader, although I'm starting to struggle with the Latin and Greek naming):

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; quader = create_exponent_function(4)
(anonymous function)
&lt;/pre&gt;

These are ordinary Julia functions:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; squarer(4)
16
julia&gt; cuber(5)
125
julia&gt; quader(6)
1296
&lt;/pre&gt;

The definition of the &lt;tt&gt;create_exponent_function()&lt;/tt&gt; above is perfectly valid Julia code, but it's not idiomatic. For one thing, the return value doesn't always need to be provided explicitly — the final evaluation is returned if &lt;tt&gt;return&lt;/tt&gt; isn't used. Also, in this case, the full form of the function definition can be replaced with the shorter one-line version. This gives the concise version:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; function create_exponent_function(x)
          y -&gt; y^x
       end
create_exponent_function (generic function with 1 method)&lt;/pre&gt;

which acts in the same way.

      <comment>/* Types */ intro</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Types ==

This section, on types, and the next section, on functions and methods, should ideally be read at the same time, because the two topics are so closely connected.

=== Types of type ===
Data elements come in different shapes and sizes, which are called '''types'''. 

Consider the following numeric values: a floating point number, a rational number, and an integer:

    0.5  1/2  1

It's easy for humans to add these numbers without much thought, but a computer won't be able to use one piece of code to add all three values, because the types are different. Code for adding rational numbers probably includes numerator and denominator wrangling, whereas code for adding integers won't. The computer will probably convert two of these values to be the same type as the third — typically the integer and the rational will be converted to floating-point — then the three floating-point numbers will be added together.

This business of converting types obviously takes time. So, to write fast code, you want to make sure that you don't make the computer waste time by continually converting values from one type to another. When Julia compiles your source code (which happens every time you evaluate a function for the first time), any type specifications you've provided allow the compiler to produce more efficient executable code.

Another issue with converting types is that in some cases you'll be losing precision — converting a rational number to a floating-point number is likely to lose some precision.

The official word from the designers of Julia is that types are optional. In other words, if you don't want to worry about types (and if you don't mind your code running slower than it might), then you can ignore them. But you'll encounter them in error messages and the documentation, so you will eventually have to tackle them… 

A compromise is to write your top-level code without worrying about types, but, when you want to speed up your code, find out the bottlenecks where your program spends the most time, and clean up the types in that area.

=== Primitives and composite types ===

There's a lot to know about Julia's type system, so the official documentation is really the place to go. But here's a brief overview.

There are primitive or basic types, and complex or composite types. Primitive types are the building blocks, whereas composite types are typically the higher-level data structures that group related pieces of information about a data object. There are also abstract types, which are used to organize and classify the rest of the types you'll want to use.

You'll probably see the following primitive types:

* the basic integer and float types (signed and unsigned): Int8, Uint8, Int16, Uint16, Int32, Uint32, Int64, Uint64, Int128, Uint128, Float16, Float32, and Float64
* more advanced numeric types, Complex, BigFloat, BigInt, Rational
* Bool and Char (Boolean and character)
* String
* Array
* Any

Types are organized into a hierarchical structure, with the more general types containing the more specific subtypes. The more general types are abstract types, but typically you use the concrete subtypes of an abstract type. For example, Number contains Real and Complex. Real contains FloatingPoint, Integer, Rational, and MathConst.

=== Subtypes and super types ===

Julia provides two functions for investigating and navigating the type hierarchy: &lt;tt&gt;subtypes()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;super()&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; subtypes(Integer)
5-element Array{Any,1}:
 BigInt
 Bool
 Char
 Signed
 Unsigned
julia&gt; super(Float64)
FloatingPoint
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;sizeof()&lt;/tt&gt; function tells you how many bytes an item of this type occupies:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; sizeof(BigFloat)
32
julia&gt; sizeof(Char)
4
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to know how big a number you can fit into a particular type, these two functions are useful:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; typemax(Int64)
9223372036854775807
julia&gt; typemin(Int32)
-2147483648
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Specifying type ===

We've already seen that Julia likes to guess at the types of things you put in your code, sometimes by getting a hint from the first value:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [1:10]
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
 10
julia&gt; [1.0:10]
10-element Array{Float64,1}:
  1.0
  2.0
  3.0
  4.0

You can specify the type that a variable's value must have. You have to do this inside a function definition, not at the top, global, level. The syntax uses the &lt;tt&gt;::&lt;/tt&gt; syntax, which means &quot;is of type&quot;. So:

x::Int64

means that &quot;x is of type Integer64&quot;, so the variable x will always contain a 64-bit integer. 

Here's a simple example. Usually, when you square an integer value, you'll get another integer:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; x = 4
4
julia&gt; typeof(x)
Int64
julia&gt; y = x^2
16
julia&gt; typeof(y)
Int64
&lt;/pre&gt;

(The useful function &lt;tt&gt;typeof()&lt;/tt&gt; returns the type of the argument.)

In the following code, the value of x is Int64, due to the array construction's default, but the type of y is set to be Float64. So whenever y is set to x^2 inside the loop, it's always a Float64:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; function main()
y::Float64 = 0   # y is a Float64
for x in 1:10
     y = x^2            # y is a Float, even if x^2 is an Int
     typey = typeof(y)
     typex = typeof(x)
     typexsquared = typeof(x^2)
    println(&quot;x is $x, y is $y, type of x is $typex, type of y is $typey&quot;)
 end
end
julia&gt; main()
x is 1, y is 1.0, type of x is Int64, type of y is Float64
x is 2, y is 4.0, type of x is Int64, type of y is Float64
x is 3, y is 9.0, type of x is Int64, type of y is Float64
x is 4, y is 16.0, type of x is Int64, type of y is Float64
x is 5, y is 25.0, type of x is Int64, type of y is Float64
x is 6, y is 36.0, type of x is Int64, type of y is Float64
x is 7, y is 49.0, type of x is Int64, type of y is Float64
x is 8, y is 64.0, type of x is Int64, type of y is Float64
x is 9, y is 81.0, type of x is Int64, type of y is Float64
x is 10, y is 100.0, type of x is Int64, type of y is Float64
&lt;/pre&gt;

For printing purposes it won't make much difference, but if you later decide to use the value of y, its type might become significant.

==Creating simple composite types==

Here's an example of creating a simple composite type that can handle the old-fashioned British currency. Before Britain saw the light and introduced a decimal currency, the monetary system used pounds, shillings, and pence, where a pound consisted of 20 shillings, and a shilling consisted of 12 pence. This was called the £sd or LSD system (Latin for Librae, Solidii, Denarii, because the system originated in the Roman empire).

To define a suitable type, start with the type declaration:

  &lt;pre&gt;type LSD&lt;/pre&gt;

To contain a price in pounds, shillings, and pence, this new type should contain three fields, pounds, shillings, and pence:  

&lt;pre&gt;   pounds::Int 
   shillings::Int
   pence::Int
&lt;/pre&gt;
   
The important task is to create a '''constructor function'''. This has the same name as the type, and accepts three values as arguments. After a few checks for invalid values, the special &lt;tt&gt;new()&lt;/tt&gt; function creates a new object with the passed-in values. Remember we're still inside the &lt;tt&gt;type&lt;/tt&gt; definition.

&lt;pre&gt;   function LSD(a,b,c)
    if a &lt; 0 || b &lt; 0 
      error(&quot;no negative numbers&quot;)
    end
    if c &gt; 12 || b &gt; 20
      error(&quot;too many pence or shillings&quot;)
    end
    new(a, b, c) 
   end   
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we can finish the type definition:

&lt;pre&gt;end&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's the complete type definition again:

&lt;pre&gt;
type LSD
   pounds::Int 
   shillings::Int
   pence::Int
   
   function LSD(a,b,c)
    if a &lt; 0 || b &lt; 0 
      error(&quot;no negative numbers&quot;)
    end
    if c &gt; 12 || b &gt; 20
      error(&quot;too many pence or shillings&quot;)
    end
    new(a, b, c) 
   end   
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's now possible to create new objects that store old-fashioned British prices:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt;price1 = LSD(5,10,6)
LSD(5,10,6)

julia&gt;price2 = LSD(1,6,8)
LSD(1,6,8)
&lt;/pre&gt;

And you can't create bad prices, because of the simple checks added to the constructor function:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; price = LSD(1,0,13)
ERROR: too many pence or shillings
 in LSD at none:11
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you inspect one of the price objects we've created:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; names(price1)
3-element Array{Symbol,1}:
 :pounds   
 :shillings
 :pence    
&lt;/pre&gt;
 
you can see the three field symbols, and these are storing the values:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; price1.pounds
5
julia&gt; price1.shillings
10
julia&gt; price1.pence
6
&lt;/pre&gt;

The next task is to make this new type behave in the same way as other Julia objects. For example, we can't add two prices: 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; p1 + p2
ERROR: `+` has no method matching +(::LSD, ::LSD)
&lt;/pre&gt;

and the output looks poor:

&lt;pre&gt;LSD(5,10,6)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Julia has the addition function (&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;) with methods defined for many types of object. The following code adds another method that can handle two LSD objects:

&lt;pre&gt;function +{LSD}(a::LSD, b::LSD)
  newpence = a.pence + b.pence
  newshillings = a.shillings + b.shillings
  newpounds = a.pounds + b.pounds
  subtotal = newpence + newshillings * 12 + newpounds * 240
  (pounds, balance) = divrem(subtotal, 240)
  (shillings, pence) = divrem(balance, 12)
  LSD(pounds, shillings, pence)
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

The first two lines and the last line are the key to adding new behavior to Julia. This definition adds a new method to the &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; function, one that accepts two LSD objects, adds them together, and produce a new LSD object containing the sum.

Now you can add two prices:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; price1 + price2
LSD(6,17,2)
&lt;/pre&gt;

which is indeed the result of adding LSD(5,10,6) and LSD(1,6,8).

The next problem to address is the unattractive presentation of LSD objects. This is fixed in exactly the same way, by adding a new method, but this time to the &lt;tt&gt;show()&lt;/tt&gt; function, which belongs to the Base environment:

&lt;pre&gt;function Base.show(io::IO, money::LSD)
    print(io, &quot;£$(money.pounds).$(money.shillings)s.$(money.pence)d&quot;)
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here, the &lt;tt&gt;io&lt;/tt&gt; is the output channel currently used by all &lt;tt&gt;show()&lt;/tt&gt; methods. Here it's a simple print expression that displays the field values with appropriate punctuation and separators.
 
&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; price1 + price2
£6.17s.2d

julia&gt; price1 + price2 + LSD(0,19,11) + LSD(19,19,6)
£27.16s.7d
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can add one or more aliases, which are alternative names for a particular type. Here, &lt;tt&gt;Price&lt;/tt&gt; is a better alternative to &lt;tt&gt;LSD&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; typealias Price LSD
LSD (constructor with 1 method)

julia&gt; Price(1, 19, 11)
£1.19s.11d
&lt;/pre&gt;

So far, so good, but LSD objects are still not yet fully developed. If you want to do subtraction, multiplication, and division, you have to define additional methods. Subtraction is easy enough, just requiring some fiddling with shillings and pence, so we've leave that for now, but what about multiplication? Multiplying a price by a number involves two types of object, one a Price/LSD object, the other - well, any number should be possible:

&lt;pre&gt;function *{LSD}(a::LSD, b::Number)
  totalpence = b * (a.pence + a.shillings * 12 + a.pounds * 240)
  (pounds, balance) = divrem(totalpence, 240)
  (shillings, pence) = divrem(balance, 12)
  LSD(pounds, shillings, pence)
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Like the &lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt; method, the &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; method is defined specifically to multiply a price by a number. It works surprisingly well in a number of situations:

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; price1 * 2
£11.1s.0d
julia&gt; price1 * 3
£16.11s.6d
julia&gt; price1 * 10
£55.5s.0d
julia&gt; price1 * 1.5
£8.5s.9d
julia&gt; price3 = Price(0,6,5)
£0.6s.5d
julia&gt; price3 * 1//7
£0.0s.11d
&lt;/pre&gt;

Some failures are expected, because we didn't allow for the really old-fashioned fractions of a penny, the halfpenny, and the farthing:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; price1 * 0.25
ERROR: InexactError()
&lt;/pre&gt;

(I think here the answer should be £1.7s.7½d.)

But there's a more pressing problem. At the moment you have to give the price followed by the multiplier; the other way round fails:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; 2 * price1
ERROR: `*` has no method matching *(::Int64, ::LSD)
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is because, although Julia can find a method that matches &lt;tt&gt;(a::LSD, b::Number)&lt;/tt&gt;, she can't find it the other way round: &lt;tt&gt;(a::Number, b::LSD)&lt;/tt&gt;. But adding it isn't too difficult:

&lt;pre&gt;function *{LSD}(a::Number, b::LSD)
  b * a
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

This code adds another method to the &lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt; function:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; price1 * 2
£11.1s.0d

julia&gt; 2 * price1 
£11.1s.0d

julia&gt; for i in 1:10
       println(price1 * i)
       end
£5.10s.6d
£11.1s.0d
£16.11s.6d
£22.2s.0d
£27.12s.6d
£33.3s.0d
£38.13s.6d
£44.4s.0d
£49.14s.6d
£55.5s.0d&lt;/pre&gt;

The prices are now looking like an old British shop from the 19th century! 

It's still possible to add and improve this type structure — it would depend on how you envisage you or others using it. For example, you might want to add division and modulo methods, and to act intelligently about negative monetary values.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Dictionaries and sets==

=== Dictionaries ===

Many of the functions introduced so far have been shown working on arrays (and tuples). But arrays are just one type of collection. Julia has others.

A simple look-up table is a useful way of organizing many types of data: given a single number or string, called a key, what is the corresponding data value? For this purpose, Julia provides the Dictionary object, called Dict for short. It's an &quot;associative collection&quot;.

=== Creating dictionaries ===

You can create a simple dictionary using the following syntax:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; dict = {&quot;a&quot; =&gt; 1, &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 2, &quot;c&quot; =&gt; 3}
Dict{Any,Any} with 3 entries:
  &quot;c&quot; =&gt; 3
  &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 2
  &quot;a&quot; =&gt; 1
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;tt&gt;dict&lt;/tt&gt; is now a dictionary. The keys are &quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, and &quot;c&quot;, the corresponding values are 1, 2, and 3. Keys are unique.

This declaration, using curly braces, created a dictionary of type Any. Or you can use square brackets to create a dictionary of a specific type. 

You can also create dictionaries using the comprehension syntax:

&lt;pre&gt;[i =&gt; sind(i) for i = 0:5:360]
&lt;/pre&gt;

and using this syntax to create an empty dictionary:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; (String =&gt; Any)[]
Dict{String,Any} with 0 entries&lt;/pre&gt;

All this changes in version 0.4 of Julia:

&lt;pre&gt;dict = Dict(&quot;a&quot; =&gt; 1, &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 2, &quot;c&quot; =&gt; 3)&lt;/pre&gt;

which infers type if possible.

&lt;pre&gt;dict = Dict{Any,Any}(a=&gt;1, &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 2)&lt;/pre&gt;

constructs an untyped dictionary.

&lt;pre&gt;dict = Dict{ASCIIString, Int64}()&lt;/pre&gt;

constructs a typed empty dictionary.

Dictionary comprehension:

&lt;pre&gt;Dict(i =&gt; sind(i) for i = 0:5:360)&lt;/pre&gt; ?

===  Looking things up ===

To get a value, given a key:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; dict[&quot;a&quot;]
1
&lt;/pre&gt;

or you can use the &lt;tt&gt;get()&lt;/tt&gt; function, and provide a default value if there's no value for that particular key:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; get(dict, &quot;a&quot;, 0)
1
julia&gt; get(dict, &quot;1&quot;, 0)
0
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you don't use a default value as a safety precaution, what happens? 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; dict = {&quot;a&quot;=&gt; 1 ,&quot;b&quot;=&gt; 2,&quot;c&quot;=&gt;3 ,&quot;d&quot;=&gt;4 ,&quot;e&quot;=&gt;5 }
Dict{Any,Any} with 5 entries:
  &quot;c&quot; =&gt; 3
  &quot;e&quot; =&gt; 5
  &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 2
  &quot;a&quot; =&gt; 1
  &quot;d&quot; =&gt; 4
julia&gt; dict[&quot;f&quot;]
ERROR: key not found: &quot;f&quot;
 in getindex at dict.jl:615
&lt;/pre&gt;

You'll see the &quot;key not found&quot; error. If you don't want to provide a default value, use a try/catch block:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; try
          dict[&quot;f&quot;]
       catch error
         println(error)
       end
KeyError(&quot;f&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

To change a value assigned to a key:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; dict[&quot;a&quot;] = 10
10
&lt;/pre&gt;

(Remember that keys must be unique for a dictionary. There's always only one key called &quot;a&quot; in this dictionary, so when you assign a value to a key that already exists, you're not creating a new one, just modifying an existing one.)

To see if the dictionary contains a key, use &lt;tt&gt;haskey()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; haskey(dict, &quot;d&quot;)
false
&lt;/pre&gt;

To check for the existence of a key/value pair:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; in((&quot;b&quot;,2),dict)
true
&lt;/pre&gt;

To add a new key and value to a dictionary, use this:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; dict[&quot;d&quot;] = 4
4
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can delete a key from the dictionary, using &lt;tt&gt;delete!()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; delete!(dict, &quot;d&quot;)
Dict{Any,Any} with 3 entries:
  &quot;c&quot; =&gt; 3
  &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 2
  &quot;a&quot; =&gt; 10
&lt;/pre&gt;

You'll notice that the dictionary doesn't seem to be sorted in any way — the keys are in no particular order. This is due to the way they're stored, and you can't sort them in place.

To get all keys, use the &lt;tt&gt;keys()&lt;/tt&gt; function:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; keys(dict)
KeyIterator for a Dict{Any,Any} with 3 entries. Keys:
  &quot;c&quot;
  &quot;b&quot;
  &quot;a&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The result is a Key iterator, that, as its names suggests, is ideally suited for iterating through a dictionary key by key:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [key for key in  keys(dict)]
6-element Array{Any,1}:
 &quot;f&quot;
 &quot;c&quot;
 &quot;e&quot;
 &quot;b&quot;
 &quot;a&quot;
 &quot;d&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

To get all values, use the &lt;tt&gt;values()&lt;/tt&gt; function:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; values(dict)
ValueIterator for a Dict{Any,Any} with 3 entries. Values:
  3
  2
  10
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to go through a dictionary and process each key/value, you can make use the fact that dictionaries themselves are iterable objects:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for e in dict
            println(e)
          end
(&quot;c&quot;,3)
(&quot;b&quot;,2)
(&quot;a&quot;,5)
&lt;/pre&gt;

where e is a tuple for each key/value pair. Or you could do:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for k in keys(dict)
       println(k, &quot; ==&gt; &quot;, dict[k])
       end
c ==&gt; 3
b ==&gt; 2
a ==&gt; 5
&lt;/pre&gt;

Even better, you can use a key/value tuple to simplify the iteration even more:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for (key,value) in dict
              println(key, &quot; ==&gt; &quot;, value)
end
c ==&gt; 3
b ==&gt; 2
a ==&gt; 5
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's another example:

&lt;pre&gt;for tuple in [&quot;1&quot;=&gt;&quot;Hydrogen&quot;, &quot;2&quot;=&gt;&quot;Helium&quot;, &quot;3&quot;=&gt;&quot;Lithium&quot;]
    println(&quot;Element $(tuple[1]) is  $(tuple[2])&quot;)
end
Element 1 is  Hydrogen
Element 2 is  Helium
Element 3 is  Lithium
&lt;/pre&gt;

(Notice the string interpolation operator, &lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt;. This allows you to use a variable's name in a string and get the variable's value when the string is printed. You can include any Julia expression in a string using &lt;tt&gt;$()&lt;/tt&gt;.)

===  Sorting a dictionary ===

Because dictionaries aren't sorted, you have to do a little more work to get a sorted dictionary:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; dict = {&quot;a&quot; =&gt; 1,&quot;b&quot; =&gt;2 ,&quot;c&quot; =&gt;3 ,&quot;d&quot; =&gt;4 ,&quot;e&quot; =&gt;5 ,&quot;f&quot; =&gt;6 }
Dict{Any,Any} with 6 entries:
  &quot;f&quot; =&gt; 6
  &quot;c&quot; =&gt; 3
  &quot;e&quot; =&gt; 5
  &quot;b&quot; =&gt; 2
  &quot;a&quot; =&gt; 1
  &quot;d&quot; =&gt; 4

julia&gt; for i in sort(collect(keys(dict)))
           println(i, &quot; &quot;,dict[i])
       end
a 1
b 2
c 3
d 4
e 5
f 6
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Sets ===

A set is a collection of elements, just like an array or dictionary.

The two important differences between a set and other types of collection is that in a set you can have only one of each element, and, in a set, the order of elements isn't important. An array, of course, can have multiple copies of elements, and their order is remembered:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [1,2,3,1,3,2]
7-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 2
 3
 1
 3
 2
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can create an empty set using the Set constructor function:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; colors = Set()
Set{Any}({})
&lt;/pre&gt;

As elsewhere in Julia, you can use curly braces and omit the type specifications, so that each element can be any type, or specify the type for every element:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; primes = Set{Int64}()
Set{Int64}({})
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can create and fill sets in one go:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; colors = Set({&quot;red&quot;,&quot;green&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;,&quot;yellow&quot;})
Set{Any}({&quot;yellow&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;,&quot;green&quot;,&quot;red&quot;})
&lt;/pre&gt;

or you can use square brackets if you want Julia to play &quot;guess the type&quot;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; colors = Set([&quot;red&quot;,&quot;green&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;,&quot;yellow&quot;])
Set{ASCIIString}({&quot;yellow&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;,&quot;green&quot;,&quot;red&quot;})
&lt;/pre&gt;

Quite a few of the functions that work with arrays also work with sets. Adding elements to sets, for example, is a bit like adding elements to arrays. You can use &lt;tt&gt;push!()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;tt&gt;julia&gt; push!(colors, &quot;black&quot;)
Set{ASCIIString}({&quot;yellow&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;,&quot;green&quot;,&quot;black&quot;,&quot;red&quot;})
&lt;/tt&gt;

But you can't use &lt;tt&gt;unshift!()&lt;/tt&gt;, because that works only for ordered things like arrays. What happens if you try to add something to the set that's already there? Absolutely nothing. You don't get a copy added, because it's a set, not an array, and sets don't store repeated elements. To see if something is in the set, you can use &lt;tt&gt;in()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; in(&quot;green&quot;, colors)
true
&lt;/pre&gt;

There are some standard operations you can do with sets, namely find their '''union''', '''intersection''', and '''difference''', with the functions, &lt;tt&gt;union()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;intersect()&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;setdiff()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; rainbow = Set({&quot;red&quot;,&quot;orange&quot;,&quot;yellow&quot;,&quot;green&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;,&quot;indigo&quot;,&quot;violet&quot;})
Set{Any}({&quot;indigo&quot;,&quot;yellow&quot;,&quot;orange&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;,&quot;violet&quot;,&quot;green&quot;,&quot;red&quot;})
&lt;/pre&gt;

The union of two sets is the set of everything that is in either one or the other. The result is a set — so you can't have two &quot;yellow&quot;s here:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; union(colors, rainbow)
Set{Any}({&quot;indigo&quot;,&quot;yellow&quot;,&quot;orange&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;,&quot;violet&quot;,&quot;green&quot;,&quot;black&quot;,&quot;red&quot;})
&lt;/pre&gt;

The intersection of two sets is the set that contains every element that belongs to both sets:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; intersect(colors, rainbow)
Set{Any}({&quot;yellow&quot;,&quot;blue&quot;,&quot;green&quot;,&quot;red&quot;})
&lt;/pre&gt;

The difference between two sets is the set of elements that are in the first set, but not in the second. This time, the order in which you supply the sets matters. The &lt;tt&gt;setdiff()&lt;/tt&gt; function finds the elements that are in the set colors but not in the set rainbow:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; setdiff(colors, rainbow)
Set{Any}({&quot;black&quot;})

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Strings and characters ==

=== Strings ===

A string is a sequence of one or more characters enclosed in double quotes:

&lt;pre&gt;&quot;this is a string&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to include a double quote character in the string, it has to be preceded with a backslash, otherwise the rest of the string would be interpreted as Julia code, with potentially interesting results.

Strings can also be enclosed in triple double quotes (12 single quotes in all!). This is useful because you can use ordinary double quotes inside the string without having to put backslashes before them:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; &quot;&quot;&quot;this is &quot;a&quot; string&quot;&quot;&quot;
&quot;this is \&quot;a\&quot; string&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You'll encounter a few specialized types of string too:

* &lt;tt&gt;r&quot; &quot;&lt;tt&gt; indicates a regular expression
* &lt;tt&gt;v&quot; &quot;&lt;/tt&gt; indicates a version string
* &lt;tt&gt;b&quot; &quot;&lt;/tt&gt; indicates a byte literal

Strings are immutable objects, so you can't change them once they're created. But it's easy to make new strings from parts of existing ones.

===  Substrings ===

To extract a smaller string from a string, use the same techniques that you use to extract a group of elements from arrays:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; s = &quot;a load of characters&quot;
&quot;a load of characters&quot;
julia&gt; s[1:end]
&quot;a load of characters&quot;
julia&gt; s[3:6]
&quot;load&quot;
julia&gt; s[3:end-6]
&quot;load of char&quot;
julia&gt; s[1:1]
&quot;a&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Splitting and joining strings ===

You can stick strings together using the multiply (&lt;tt&gt;*&lt;/tt&gt;) operator:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; &quot;s&quot; * &quot;t&quot;
&quot;st&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You might have been expecting to use the addition (&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;) operator:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; &quot;s&quot; + &quot;t&quot;
ERROR: `+` has no method matching +(::ASCIIString, ::ASCIIString)
&lt;/pre&gt;

but perhaps this will make you happier with the choice:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; &quot;s&quot; ^ 18
&quot;ssssssssssssssssss&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

To split a string, use &lt;tt&gt;split(string, chars)&lt;/tt&gt;. Given this simple string:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; s = &quot;You know my methods, Watson.&quot;
&quot;You know my methods, Watson.&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

a simple call to the &lt;tt&gt;split()&lt;/tt&gt; function divides the string at the spaces:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; split(s)
5-element Array{SubString{ASCIIString},1}:
 &quot;You&quot;
 &quot;know&quot;
 &quot;my&quot;
 &quot;methods,&quot;
 &quot;Watson.&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

But you can specify the character or characters to split instead:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; split(s, &quot;e&quot;)
2-element Array{SubString{ASCIIString},1}:
 &quot;You know my m&quot;
 &quot;thods, Watson.&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The characters you use to split on don't appear in the final result:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; split(s, &quot;hod&quot;)
2-element Array{SubString{ASCIIString},1}:
 &quot;You know my met&quot;
 &quot;s, Watson.&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you want to split a string into separate single-character strings, use the empty string (&quot;&quot;) which splits the string between the characters:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; split(s,&quot;&quot;)
28-element Array{SubString{ASCIIString},1}:
 &quot;Y&quot;
 &quot;o&quot;
 &quot;u&quot;
 &quot; &quot;
 &quot;k&quot;
 &quot;n&quot;
 &quot;o&quot;
 &quot;w&quot;
 &quot; &quot;
 &quot;m&quot;
 &quot;y&quot;
 &quot; &quot;
 &quot;m&quot;
 &quot;e&quot;
 &quot;t&quot;
 &quot;h&quot;
 &quot;o&quot;
 &quot;d&quot;
 &quot;s&quot;
 &quot;,&quot;
 &quot; &quot;
 &quot;W&quot;
 &quot;a&quot;
 &quot;t&quot;
 &quot;s&quot;
 &quot;o&quot;
 &quot;n&quot;
 &quot;.&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

To use regular expressions, use the special regex string construction&lt;tt&gt;r&quot; &quot;&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; split(s, r&quot;a|e|i|o|u&quot;)
8-element Array{SubString{ASCIIString},1}:
 &quot;Y&quot;
 &quot;&quot;
 &quot; kn&quot;
 &quot;w my m&quot;
 &quot;th&quot;
 &quot;ds, W&quot;
 &quot;ts&quot;
 &quot;n.&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here, the &lt;tt&gt;r&quot;a|e|i|o|u&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; is a regular expression string, and — as you'll know if you love regular expressions as much as I do :) — that this matches any of the vowels. So the resulting array consists of the string split at every vowel.

If you wanted to keep the vowels, you would have to delve deeper into the world of regex. That's to come.

===  String interpolation ===

You often want to use the results of Julia expressions inside strings. For example, suppose you want to say:

	&quot;The value of x is n.&quot;

where &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; is the current value of &lt;tt&gt;x&lt;/tt&gt;.

Any Julia expression can be inserted into a string using the &lt;tt&gt;$()&lt;/tt&gt; construction:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; x = 42
&lt;/pre&gt;

and then 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; &quot;The value of x is $(x).&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

displays:

&lt;pre&gt;&quot;The value of x is 42.&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

In fact, you don't have to use the parentheses if you're just using the name of a variable:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; &quot;The value of x is $(x).&quot;
&quot;The value of x is 42.&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

but if you want to include a Julia expression in a string, enclose it in parentheses first, then precede it with a dollar sign:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt;  &quot;The value of 2 + 2 is $(2 + 2).&quot;
&quot;The value of 2 + 2 is 4.&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Character objects ===

Above we extracted smaller strings from larger strings:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; s[1:1]
&quot;a&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

But what happens if we extract a single element from a string:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; s[1]
'a'
&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice the single quotes. In Julia, these are used to mark '''character objects,''' so &lt;tt&gt;'a'&lt;/tt&gt; is a character object, but &lt;tt&gt;&quot;a&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; is a string with length 1. These are not equivalent.

You can convert character objects to strings easily enough:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; string('s') * string('d')
&quot;sd&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's easy to input Unicode characters:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; '\u2640'
'♀'
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Converting to and from strings ===

The &lt;tt&gt;dec()&lt;/tt&gt; function turns a (decimal) number into a string. The &lt;tt&gt;int()&lt;/tt&gt; function turns a character into an integer, and the &lt;tt&gt;char()&lt;/tt&gt; function turns an integer into a character. And &lt;tt&gt;string()&lt;/tt&gt; converts objects to strings.

If you're deeply attached to C-style &lt;tt&gt;printf()&lt;/tt&gt; functionality, you'll be able to use a Julia macro (which are called by prefacing them with the &lt;tt&gt;@&lt;/tt&gt; sign):

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; @printf(&quot;pi = %0.20f&quot;, float(pi))
pi = 3.14159265358979311600
&lt;/pre&gt;

or you can create another string using the &lt;tt&gt;sprintf()&lt;/tt&gt; macro:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; @sprintf(&quot;pi = %0.20f&quot;, float(pi))
&quot;pi = 3.14159265358979311600&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Convert string to array ===

To read from a string into an array, you can use the &lt;tt&gt;IOBuffer()&lt;/tt&gt; function. This is available in a number of Julia functions (including &lt;tt&gt;printf()&lt;/tt&gt;).  Here's a string of data (it could have been read from a file):

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; data=&quot;1 2 3 4
       5 6 7 8
       9 0 1 2&quot;
&quot;1 2 3 4\n5 6 7 8\n9 0 1 2&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now you can &quot;read&quot;  this string using functions such as &lt;tt&gt;readdlm()&lt;/tt&gt;, the &quot;read with delimiters&quot; function:

&lt;tt&gt;julia&gt; readdlm(IOBuffer(data))
3x4 Array{Float64,2}:
 1.0  2.0  3.0  4.0
 5.0  6.0  7.0  8.0
 9.0  0.0  1.0  2.0
&lt;/tt&gt;

Here's an optional Type specification:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; readdlm(IOBuffer(data), Int)
3x4 Array{Int32,2}:
 1  2  3  4
 5  6  7  8
 9  0  1  2
&lt;/pre&gt;

Sometimes you want to do things to strings that you can do better with arrays. Here's an example.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; i = &quot;/Users/me/Music/iTunes/iTunes Media/Mobile Applications&quot;;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Explode the pathname string into character objects:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; collect(i)
57-element Array{Char,1}:
 '/'
 'U'
 's'
 'e'
 'r'
 's'
 '/'
 ...
&lt;/pre&gt;

Count the occurrences of a particular character object, using an anonymous function:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; count(c -&gt; c =='/', collect(i))
6
&lt;/pre&gt;

Similarly, you can use &lt;tt&gt;split()&lt;/tt&gt; to split the string and count the results:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; count(c -&gt; c == &quot;/&quot;, split(i, &quot;&quot;))
6
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Finding and replacing things inside strings ===

There are two basic approaches to finding and replacing parts of strings.
You can search for the first occurrence of characters using search():

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; s
&quot;You know my methods, Watson.&quot;

julia&gt; search(s, &quot;h&quot;)
16:16

julia&gt; search(s, &quot;meth&quot;)
13:16

julia&gt; search(s, ['a','e', 'i', 'o', 'u'])
2
&lt;/pre&gt;

this search is for the first occurrence of any of the set of characters, and 'o' was in the second position.

In each case, the result contains the indices of the characters, if present. If not:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; search(s, &quot;mo&quot;)
0:-1

julia&gt; s[0:-1]
&quot;&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can also use a regular expression string (&lt;tt&gt;r&quot; &quot;&lt;/tt&gt;)  with &lt;tt&gt;search()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; search(s, r&quot;m(y|e)&quot;)
10:11
&lt;/pre&gt;

looks for &quot;my&quot; or &quot;me&quot;

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; s[search(s, r&quot;m(y|e)&quot;)]
&quot;my&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Regular expressions ===

To return more than one matching substring of a string, you can switch to using the &lt;tt&gt;match()&lt;/tt&gt; functions, rather than &lt;tt&gt;search()&lt;/tt&gt;:

* &lt;tt&gt;match()&lt;/tt&gt; returns the first match or nothing
* &lt;tt&gt;matchall()&lt;/tt&gt; returns an array of matching substrings
* &lt;tt&gt;eachmatch()&lt;/tt&gt; returns an iterator

With &lt;tt&gt;eachmatch()&lt;/tt&gt;, for example, first you run the regex over the string. 

Here I've loaded the text of &quot;The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes&quot; into the string called text:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; f= &quot;adventures-of-sherlock-holmes.txt&quot;
julia&gt; text = readall(f);
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now to look for everything with the letters &quot;L&quot; followed closely by &quot;ed&quot;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; lmatch = eachmatch(r&quot;L.*?ed&quot;, text);
&lt;/pre&gt;

The result in lmatch is an iterable object containing all the matches, as RegexMatch objects. Let's run the iterator and look at each match in turn. The &quot;.match&quot; method inspects the RegexMatch object and returns the matched substring:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for i in lmatch
       println(i.match)
       end
London - quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled

London, and I had placed
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you don't want an iterable object, use the matchall() function:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; lmatches = matchall(r&quot;L.*?ed&quot;, text);
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now the lmatches array contains the matching substrings, which you can inspect any way you want:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; lmatches[4:6]
3-element Array{SubString{UTF8String},1}:
 &quot;League of the Red&quot;
 &quot;League was founded&quot;
 &quot;London when he was young, and he wanted&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The basic &lt;tt&gt;match()&lt;/tt&gt; function looks for the first match for your regex. The RegexMatch object can be inspected using the &lt;tt&gt;.match&lt;/tt&gt; method:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; match(r&quot;She.*&quot;,text).match
&quot;Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard\r&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Testing and changing strings ===

There are lots of functions for testing and changing strings:

* &lt;tt&gt;length()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;sizeof()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;beginswith()&lt;/tt&gt; 
* &lt;tt&gt;endswith()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;contains()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;isalnum()&lt;/tt&gt; 
* &lt;tt&gt;isalpha()&lt;/tt&gt; 
* &lt;tt&gt;isascii()&lt;/tt&gt; 
* &lt;tt&gt;isblank()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;iscntrl()&lt;/tt&gt; 
* &lt;tt&gt;isdigit()&lt;/tt&gt; 
* &lt;tt&gt;islower()&lt;/tt&gt; 
* &lt;tt&gt;ispunct()&lt;/tt&gt; 
* &lt;tt&gt;isspace()&lt;/tt&gt; 
* &lt;tt&gt;isupper()&lt;/tt&gt; 
* &lt;tt&gt;isxdigit()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;uppercase()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;lowercase()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;ucfirst()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;lcfirst()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;chop()&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;chomp()&lt;/tt&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Control flow ==
Typically each line of a Julia program is evaluated in turn. There are various ways to control and modify the flow of evaluation. These correspond with the constructs used in other languages:

* '''ternary''' and '''compound''' expressions
* '''Boolean''' switching expressions
* '''if elseif else end''' - conditional evaluation
* '''for end''' - iterative evaluation
* '''while end''' - iterative conditional evaluation 
* '''try catch error throw''' exception handling
* '''do''' blocks

===Ternary expressions===

Often you'll want to do job A (or call function A) if some condition is true, or job B (function B) if it isn't. The quickest way to write this is using the ternary operator (&quot;?&quot; and &quot;:&quot;):

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; x = 1
1
julia&gt; x &gt; 3 ? &quot;yes&quot; : &quot;no&quot;
&quot;no&quot;
julia&gt; x = 5
5
julia&gt; x &gt; 3 ? &quot;yes&quot; : &quot;no&quot;
&quot;yes&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's another example:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; x = 0.3
0.3
julia&gt; x &lt; 0.5 ? sin(x) : cos(x)
0.29552020666133955
&lt;/pre&gt;

and Julia returned the value of &lt;tt&gt;sin(x)&lt;/tt&gt;, because x was less than 0.5. &lt;tt&gt;cos(x)&lt;/tt&gt; wasn't evaluated at all.

===Boolean switching expressions===

Boolean operators let you evaluate an expression if a condition is true. You can combine the condition and expression using &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt;. &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;and&quot;, and &lt;tt&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt; means &quot;or&quot;. Since Julia evaluates expressions one by one, you can easily arrange for an expression to be evaluated if — or if not — a previous condition is true or false.

The following example uses a Julia function that returns true or false depending on whether the number is prime: &lt;tt&gt;isprime(n)&lt;/tt&gt;.

With &lt;tt&gt;&amp;&amp;&lt;/tt&gt;, both parts have to be true, so we can write this (using a semicolon to chain two expressions together on a line):

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; n = 1000003; isprime(n) &amp;&amp; &quot;It's a prime!&quot;
&quot;It's a prime!&quot;
julia&gt; n = 1000004; isprime(n) &amp;&amp; &quot;It's a prime!&quot;
false
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the condition (primality) is true, the second expression is evaluated. If not, it isn't, and just the condition is returned.

With the &lt;tt&gt;||&lt;/tt&gt; operator, on the other hand:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; (n = 1000003; isprime(n) || &quot;It's not a prime!&quot;)
true
julia&gt; (n = 1000004; isprime(n) || &quot;It's not a prime!&quot;)
&quot;It's not a prime!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the condition is true, there's no need to evaluate the second expression, since we already have the one truth value we need for &quot;or&quot;. If it's false, the second one is evaluated, because it might turn out to be true.

=== If and Else ===

For a more general — and traditional — approach to conditional execution, you can use &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;elseif&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt;. If you're used to other languages, don't worry about white space, braces, indentation, brackets, semicolons, or anything like that, but remember to finish the conditional construction with end.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; name = &quot;Brinkley&quot;
&quot;Brinkley&quot;
julia&gt; if name == &quot;Jeeves&quot;
           println(&quot;Very Good Jeeves&quot;)
       elseif name == &quot;Brinkley&quot;
           println(&quot;Thank you, Brinkley&quot;)
           println(&quot;and shut the door behind you&quot;)
       else
           println(&quot;Fine, just ignore me&quot;)
       end
Thank you, Brinkley
and shut the door behind you
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;elseif&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;else&lt;/tt&gt; parts are optional too:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; name = &quot;Jeeves&quot;
julia&gt; if name == &quot;Jeeves&quot;
			println(&quot;Very Good Jeeves&quot;)
          end
Very Good Jeeves
&lt;/pre&gt;

Just don't forget the end!

Switch and case? You don't have to learn the syntax for a Julia switch or case statement, because there isn't such a thing.

===For loops and iteration===

Working through a list or a set of values or from a start value to a finish value are all examples of iteration, and the &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; ... &lt;tt&gt;end&lt;/tt&gt; construction can let you iterate through a number of different types of object, including ranges, arrays, sets, dictionaries, and strings.

Here's the standard syntax for a simple iteration through a range of values:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for i in 0:10:100
                println(i)
           end
0
10
20
30
40
50
60
70
80
90
100
&lt;/pre&gt;

The variable &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; takes the value of each element in the array (which is built from a range object) in turn — here stepping from 0 to 100 in steps of 10. 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for color in [&quot;red&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, &quot;blue&quot;] # an array
           print(color, &quot; &quot;)
       end
red green blue
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for letter in &quot;julia&quot; # a string
           print(letter, &quot; &quot;)
       end
j u l i a
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for element in (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32) # a tuple
           print(element, &quot; &quot;)
       end
1 2 4 8 16 32
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for element in {1, 2, &quot;pardon&quot;, &quot;my&quot;, sin} # one of those {} things
           println(typeof(element), &quot; &quot; , element, &quot; &quot;)
       end
Int64 1
Int64 2
ASCIIString pardon
ASCIIString my
Function sin
&lt;/pre&gt;

We haven't yet met sets and dictionaries, but iterating through them is exactly the same.

You can iterate through a 2D array, stepping &quot;down&quot; through column 1 from top to bottom, then through column 2, and so on:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; a = reshape(1:100, (10, 10))
10x10 Array{Int64,2}:
  1  11  21  31  41  51  61  71  81   91
  2  12  22  32  42  52  62  72  82   92
  3  13  23  33  43  53  63  73  83   93
  4  14  24  34  44  54  64  74  84   94
  5  15  25  35  45  55  65  75  85   95
  6  16  26  36  46  56  66  76  86   96
  7  17  27  37  47  57  67  77  87   97
  8  18  28  38  48  58  68  78  88   98
  9  19  29  39  49  59  69  79  89   99
 10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90  100

julia&gt; for n in a
       print(n, &quot; &quot;)
       end
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71 72 73 74 75 76 77 78 79 80 81 82 83 84 85 86 87 88 89 90 91 92 93 94 95 96 97 98 99 100
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can use &lt;tt&gt;=&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;in&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Fine tuning the loop: Continue===

Sometimes on a particular iteration you might want to skip to the next value. You can use &lt;tt&gt;continue&lt;/tt&gt; to skip the rest of the code inside the loop and start the loop again with the next value.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for i in 1:10
           if i % 3 == 0
              continue
           end
       println(i) # this and subsequent lines are
                     # skipped if i is a multiple of 3
       end
1
2
4
5
7
8
10
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Comprehensions ===

This oddly-named concept is simply a way of generating and collecting items. In mathematics circles you'd say something like:

 &quot;Let S be the set of all elements n where n is equal to or greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10&quot;. 
 
 In Julia, you can write this as:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; S = [n for n in 1:10];
julia&gt; S
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
  1
  2
  3
  4
  5
  6
  7
  8
  9
 10
&lt;/pre&gt;

and this is called array comprehension or list comprehension. The outer brackets collect together the elements generated by evaluating the expression placed before the &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [i^2 for i in 1:10]
10-element Array{Int64,1}:
   1
   4
   9
  16
  25
  36
  49
  64
  81
 100
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's another example, using curly braces instead of braces to make an array of Any type:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; {i^2 for i in 1:10}
10-element Array{Any,1}:
   1
   4
   9
  16
  25
  36
  49
  64
  81
 100 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Using two iterators in a comprehension makes generating tables very easy. Here we're making a table of tuples:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [(r,c) for r in 1:5, c in 1:5]
5x5 Array{(Int64,Int64),2}:
 (1,1)  (1,2)  (1,3)  (1,4)  (1,5)
 (2,1)  (2,2)  (2,3)  (2,4)  (2,5)
 (3,1)  (3,2)  (3,3)  (3,4)  (3,5)
 (4,1)  (4,2)  (4,3)  (4,4)  (4,5)
 (5,1)  (5,2)  (5,3)  (5,4)  (5,5)
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Enumerating arrays===

Often you want to go through an array element by element while also keeping track of the index number of each element. The &lt;tt&gt;enumerate()&lt;/tt&gt; function gives you an &lt;b&gt;iterable object&lt;/b&gt; that produces both an index number and the value of an array at each index number:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; m = rand(0:9, 3, 3)
3x3 Array{Int64,2}:
 9  2  9
 3  4  3
 6  1  1

julia&gt; [i for i in enumerate(m)]
9-element Array{(Int64,Any),1}:
 (1,9)
 (2,3)
 (3,6)
 (4,2)
 (5,4)
 (6,1)
 (7,9)
 (8,3)
 (9,1)
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Zipping arrays ===

Sometimes you want to work through two or more arrays at the same time, taking the first element of each array first, then the second, and so on. This is possible using the &lt;tt&gt;zip()&lt;/tt&gt; function:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for i in zip(0:10, 100:110, 200:210)
     println(i)
 end
(0,100,200)
(1,101,201)
(2,102,202)
(3,103,203)
(4,104,204)
(5,105,205)
(6,106,206)
(7,107,207)
(8,108,208)
(9,109,209)
(10,110,210)&lt;/pre&gt;

You'd think it would go wrong if the arrays are different sizes:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for i in zip(0:10, 100:110, 200:215)
     println(i)
end
(0,100,200)
(1,101,201)
(2,102,202)
(3,103,203)
(4,104,204)
(5,105,205)
(6,106,206)
(7,107,207)
(8,108,208)
(9,109,209)
(10,110,210)
&lt;/pre&gt;

but Julia isn't fooled — the oversupply in the third range is ignored.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for i in zip(0:15, 100:110, 200:210)
                      println(i)
                end
(0,100,200)
(1,101,201)
(2,102,202)
(3,103,203)
(4,104,204)
(5,105,205)
(6,106,206)
(7,107,207)
(8,108,208)
(9,109,209)
(10,110,210)
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Iterable objects===

The &quot;for something in something&quot; construction is the same for every other type of object that you can iterate through: arrays, dictionaries, sets, ranges, and so on. In Julia this is a general principle: there are a number of ways in which you can create an &quot;iterable object&quot;, an object that is designed to be used as part of the iteration process that provides the elements one at a time.

The most obvious example we've already met is the range object. It doesn't look much when you type it into the REPL:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; 0:2:100
0:2:100
&lt;/pre&gt;

But it yields the numbers on demand, when you start iterating:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; [i for i in 0:2:100]
51-element Array{Int64,1}:
   0
   2
   4
   6
   8
  10
  12
  14
  16
  18
  20
  22
  24
  26
  28
   ⋮
  74
  76
  78
  80
  82
  84
  86
  88
  90
  92
  94
  96
  98
 100&lt;/pre&gt;
 
Should you want the actual numbers from a range (or other iterable object), you can use &lt;tt&gt;collect()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; collect(0:25:100)
5-element Array{Int64,1}:
   0
  25
  50
  75
 100
&lt;/pre&gt;

This comes in useful when you have iterable objects created by other Julia functions. For example, &lt;tt&gt;permutations()&lt;/tt&gt; creates an iterable object containing all the permutations of an array. You could use &lt;tt&gt;collect()&lt;/tt&gt; to grab them and make a new array.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; collect(permutations([1:4]))
24-element Array{Array{Int64,1},1}:
 [1,2,3,4]
 [1,2,4,3]
 …
 [4,3,2,1]
&lt;/pre&gt;

Of course, there's a good reason why iterator objects don't produce all the values from the iteration at the same time: memory and performance. A range object doesn't take up much room, even if iterating over it might take ages (depending on how big the range is). If you generate all the numbers at once, rather than only producing them when they're needed, they all have to be stored somewhere… 

Julia provides iterable objects for working with other types of data. For example, when you're working with files, you can treat an open file as an iterable object:
      
&lt;pre&gt;      for line in eachline(filehandle)
         println(length(line), line)
      end
&lt;/pre&gt;

====Making your own iterable objects====

It's possible to design your own iterable objects. What you do is create a new type that has &lt;tt&gt;start()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;next()&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;done()&lt;/tt&gt; methods. Then, a &lt;tt&gt;for&lt;/tt&gt; .. &lt;tt&gt;end&lt;/tt&gt; loop can work through the components of your object by calling the methods automatically as necessary.

This example shows how you can create an iterable object that iterates through prime numbers, starting at 1.

First, you define a type:

&lt;pre&gt;type PrimeIterator
	n::Integer
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

You will later create an object of this type using the code:

&lt;pre&gt;primes = PrimeIterator(20)&lt;/pre&gt;

The number you supply is passed to the type constructor, and stored in &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt;. The iterator will be expected to generate every prime up to this number.

Next, you must define three functions that the iteration process will call when you write a looping code. First, the &lt;tt&gt;start()&lt;/tt&gt; function for starting the iteration process off. This function already exists in Julia (that's why you can iterate over all the basic data objects), so the &lt;tt&gt;Base&lt;/tt&gt; prefix is required. You're adding a new method to the &lt;tt&gt;start()&lt;/tt&gt; function, one which is designed to handle these special objects.

&lt;pre&gt;function Base.start(::PrimeIterator)
  1
end&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;next()&lt;/tt&gt; function has to return a tuple of two values, one of which is the next value of the iteration process, given the current state of the iterator, which has been stored conveniently in &lt;tt&gt;state&lt;/tt&gt;. The first item in the tuple returned, whether returned by the first part of the if clause or the else clause, is the next value of the iterator, and the last item is the state that will be preserved and passed on to the next invocation of next(). In this particular case, the code just runs up to find the next prime number above state:

&lt;pre&gt;function Base.next(::PrimeIterator,state)
	if state == 1
		return (1, 2)           # first return possibility
	else
		while ! isprime(state)
			state += 1
		end
		(state, state += 1)  # second return possibility
	end
end&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;done()&lt;/tt&gt; function is required so that the iteration knows when to stop. This is simple, because the construction of the PrimeIterator object expected a number, which acts as the obvious stop point. This function is the only one which refers to the original number which was passed to the constructor.
  
&lt;pre&gt;function Base.done(piter::PrimeIterator, state)
	state &gt;= piter.n
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

So, to run through the primes from 1 to 20:

&lt;pre&gt;primes = PrimeIterator(20)
for i in primes
       	println(i)
end
1
2
3
5
7
11
13
17
19&lt;/pre&gt;

(Code inspired by Carl Vogel posts at [http://slendermeans.org].)

===While loops===

To repeat some expressions while a condition is true, use the &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; ... &lt;tt&gt;end&lt;/tt&gt; construction.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; x = 0
while x &lt; 4
    println(x)
    x += 1
end
0
1
2
3
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Exceptions===

If you want to write code that checks for errors and handles them gracefully, use the &lt;tt&gt;try&lt;/tt&gt; ... &lt;tt&gt;catch&lt;/tt&gt; construction: 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt;try
   error(&quot;help&quot;)
catch e
   println(&quot;caught it $e&quot;)
end
caught it ErrorException(&quot;help&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Do block===

Finally, let's look at a &lt;tt&gt;do&lt;/tt&gt; block.

&lt;pre&gt;open(&quot;file.txt&quot;) do filehandle
     for line in eachline(filehandle)
         println(length(line), line)
      end
 end
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The standard approach for getting information from a text file is using the &lt;tt&gt;open()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;read()&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;close()&lt;/tt&gt; functions.

==  Reading from files ==

===Open===

To read text from a file, you obtain a file handle:

&lt;pre&gt;f = open(&quot;sherlock-holmes.txt&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

f is now Julia's connection to the file on disk.

===  Slurp — reading a file all at once ===

You can read the entire contents of the file at once:

&lt;pre&gt;  s = readall(f)
&lt;/pre&gt;


This returns a string, complete with newlines.

Or you read in the lines for subsequent processing:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; f = open(&quot;sherlock-holmes.txt&quot;);
julia&gt; lines = readlines(f)

 &quot;Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further\r\n&quot;
 &quot;interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one\r\n&quot;
 &quot;of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at\r\n&quot;
 &quot;Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.\r\n&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

then you can do something like this,  to step through the array:

&lt;pre&gt;counter = 1
for l in lines
   println(&quot;$counter $l&quot;)
   counter += 1
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

12638 interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one
12639 of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at
12640 Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.
&lt;/pre&gt;

There's a better way to do this — see &lt;tt&gt;enumerate()&lt;/tt&gt;, below.

===  Line by line ===

The &lt;tt&gt;eachline()&lt;/tt&gt; function turns a source into an iterator. This allows you to process a file a line at a time:

&lt;pre&gt;f = open(&quot;sherlock-holmes.txt&quot;);
for ln in eachline(f)
       print(&quot;$(length(ln)), $ln&quot;)
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;1, THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES by SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE
2,
28,    I. A Scandal in Bohemia
29,   II. The Red-headed League
26,  III. A Case of Identity
35,   IV. The Boscombe Valley Mystery
…
62, the island of Mauritius. As to Miss Violet Hunter, my friend
60, Holmes, rather to my disappointment, manifested no further
66, interest in her when once she had ceased to be the centre of one
65, of his problems, and she is now the head of a private school at
70, Walsall, where I believe that she has met with considerable success.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Another approach is to read until you reach the end of the file. Typically you also want to keep track of which line you're on:

&lt;pre&gt; f = open(&quot;sherlock-holmes.txt&quot;)
 line = 1 
 while !eof(f)
    x = readline(f)
    println(&quot;$line $x&quot;)
    line += 1
 end
&lt;/pre&gt;

An easier approach is to use &lt;tt&gt;enumerate()&lt;/tt&gt; on an iterable object — you'll get the line numbering for free:

&lt;pre&gt;for i in enumerate(eachline(open(&quot; holmes.txt&quot;)))
	println(i)
end&lt;/pre&gt;

Using a do block works like this:

&lt;pre&gt;open(&quot;sherlock-holmes.txt&quot;) do filehandle
     for line in eachline(filehandle)
         println(length(line), line)
      end
 end&lt;/pre&gt;

or

&lt;pre&gt;open(&quot;sherlock-holmes.txt&quot;) do f
          uppercase(readall(f))
       end&lt;/pre&gt;

With all these file functions, remember to:

&lt;pre&gt;close(f)&lt;/pre&gt;

i.e. close the file when you're done with it.
 
If you have a specific function that you want to call on a file, you can use this alternative syntax instead of the open/read/close sequence: 

&lt;pre&gt;function func(f::IOStream)
    return uppercase(readall(f))
end
open(func, filename)&lt;/pre&gt;

This opens the file, runs the function on it, then closes it again, returning the processed contents.

You can use &lt;tt&gt;readcsv()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;readdlm()&lt;/tt&gt; functions to read lines from CSV files or files delimited with certain characters, such as data files, arrays stored as text files, and tables. And if you use the DataFrames package, there's also a &lt;tt&gt;readtable()&lt;/tt&gt; specifically designed to read data into a table.

===  Working with paths and filenames  ===

These functions will be useful for working with filenames:

* &lt;tt&gt;cd(path)&lt;/tt&gt; changes the current directory
* &lt;tt&gt;readdir(path)&lt;/tt&gt; returns a lists of the contents of the named directory, or the current directory, 
* &lt;tt&gt;abspath(path)&lt;/tt&gt; returns the full path of the string
* &lt;tt&gt;joinpath(str, str, ...)&lt;/tt&gt; assembles a pathname from a pieces
* &lt;tt&gt;isdir(path)&lt;/tt&gt; tells you whether the path is a directory 

Putting these together, here's a function for walking a directory tree recursively:

&lt;pre&gt;function walkdir(dir)
    f = readdir(abspath(dir))
    for i in f
        spaces = length(matchall(r&quot;/&quot;, joinpath(dir,i)))
        println(&quot; &quot;^ (spaces * 3),  joinpath(dir,i))
        if isdir(joinpath(dir,i))
            walkdir(joinpath(dir,i))
        end
    end
end&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; walkdir(&quot;/Users/me/.julia/v0.3/&quot;)

...
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here, the rough-and-ready &lt;tt&gt;println()&lt;/tt&gt; expression makes a guess at how far to indent each line, based on how many &quot;/&quot; strings the full pathname contains.

There are plenty more useful file-handling functions:

* &lt;tt&gt;splitdir(path)&lt;/tt&gt; - split a path into a tuple of the directory name and file name.
* &lt;tt&gt;splitdrive(path)&lt;/tt&gt; - on Windows, split a path into the drive letter part and the path part. On Unix systems, the first component is always the empty string.
* &lt;tt&gt;splitext(path)&lt;/tt&gt; - if the last component of a path contains a dot, split the path into everything before the dot and everything including and after the dot. Otherwise, return a tuple of the argument unmodified and the empty string.
* &lt;tt&gt;expanduser(path)&lt;/tt&gt; - replace a tilde character at the start of a path with the current user's home directory.
* &lt;tt&gt;normpath(path)&lt;/tt&gt; - normalize a path, removing &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; entries.
* &lt;tt&gt;realpath(path)&lt;/tt&gt; - canonicalize a path by expanding symbolic links and removing &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; entries.
* &lt;tt&gt;homedir()&lt;/tt&gt; - current user's home directory.
* &lt;tt&gt;dirname(path)&lt;/tt&gt; - get the directory part of a path.
* &lt;tt&gt;basename(path)&lt;/tt&gt;- get the file name part of a path.

=== File information ===

If you want information about a specific file, use &lt;tt&gt;stat(&quot;pathname&quot;)&lt;/tt&gt;, and then use one of the fields to find out the information. Here's how to get all the information and the field names listed for a file &quot;i&quot;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for n in names(stat(i))
       println(n, &quot;: &quot;, getfield(stat(i),n))
       end
device: 16777219
inode: 2955324
mode: 16877
nlink: 943
uid: 502
gid: 20
rdev: 0
size: 32062
blksize: 4096
blocks: 0
mtime:1.409769933e9
ctime:1.409769933e9
julia&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

To filter a list of files given a search string, here's the filter() function (which is more of a fishing net or sieve, and less of a coffee filter, in that it keeps what the filter catches):

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; searchdir(path, key) = filter(x -&gt; contains(x, key), readdir(path))
searchdir (generic function with 1 method)
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Interacting with the file system ===

The &lt;tt&gt;cp()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;mv()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;rm()&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;touch()&lt;/tt&gt; functions have the same names and functions as their Unix shell counterparts.

To convert filenames to pathnames, use abspath(). You can map this over a list of files in a directory:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; map(abspath,readdir())
67-element Array{ASCIIString,1}:
 &quot;/Users/me/.CFUserTextEncoding&quot;
 &quot;/Users/me/.DS_Store&quot;
 &quot;/Users/me/.Trash&quot;
 &quot;/Users/me/.Xauthority&quot;
 &quot;/Users/me/.ahbbighrc&quot;
 &quot;/Users/me/.apdisk&quot;
 &quot;/Users/me/.atom&quot;
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

To restrict the list to filenames that contain a particular substring, use an anonymous function inside &lt;tt&gt;filter()&lt;/tt&gt; — something like this:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; filter(x -&gt; contains(x, &quot;re&quot;),map(abspath,readdir()))
4-element Array{ASCIIString,1}:
 &quot;/Users/me/.DS_Store&quot;
 &quot;/Users/me/.gitignore&quot;
 &quot;/Users/me/.hgignore_global&quot;
 &quot;/Users/me/Pictures&quot;
 ...
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 
==Writing to files==

To write to a file, open it using the &quot;w&quot; flag and make sure that you have permission to create the file in the current directory:

&lt;pre&gt;outfile = open(&quot;/tmp/temp.txt&quot;, &quot;w&quot;)&lt;/pre&gt;

Then you can write a line to a file using &lt;tt&gt;write()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;write(outfile,&quot;A, B, C, D\n&quot;)&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's how to write 20 lines of 4 random numbers, separated by commas:

&lt;pre&gt;function fourrandom()
    return rand(Int,4)
end

for i = 1:20
     n1, n2, n3, n4  = fourrandom()
     write(outfile, join((n1, n2, n3, n4), &quot;,&quot;), &quot;\n&quot;)
end

close(outfile)&lt;/pre&gt;

Don't forget to close the file when you've finished.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Working with dates and times  ===

To work with dates, you must first import the Dates package (if you're still using version 0.3 — version 0.4 includes this package):

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; using Dates&lt;/pre&gt;

The documentation is extensive but, to save you a few hours, here are the basic essentials.

===  Date and DateTimes ===

A Date object represents just a date: no time zones, no daylight saving issues, etc.. It's accurate to, well, a day.

A DateTime object is a combination of a date and a time of day, and so it specifies an exact moment in time. It's accurate to a millisecond or so.

Use these two constructors to make the type of object you want:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; birthday = Date(1997,3,15)
1997-03-15
julia&gt; armistice = DateTime(1918,11,11,11,11,11)
1918-11-11T11:11:11
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;today()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;now()&lt;/tt&gt; functions return a Date and DateTime object for the current instant in time:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; datetoday = today()
2014-09-02
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; datetimenow = now()
2014-09-02T08:20:07
&lt;/pre&gt;

To create an object from a formatted string, use the &lt;tt&gt;DateTime()&lt;/tt&gt; function in Dates, and supply a suitable format string that matches the formattting:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Dates.DateTime(&quot;20140529 120000&quot;,&quot;yyyymmdd HHMMSS&quot;)
2014-05-29T12:00:00
julia&gt; Dates.DateTime(&quot;18/05/2009 16:12&quot;,&quot;dd/mm/yyyy HH:MM&quot;)
2009-05-18T16:12:00
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Date and time queries ===

Once you have a date/time or date object, you can extract particular information from it with the following functions. For date objects:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; year(birthday)
1997
julia&gt; month(birthday)
3
julia&gt; day(birthday)
15
&lt;/pre&gt;

and, for date/time objects:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; minute(now())
37
julia&gt; hour(now())
16
julia&gt; second(now())
8
&lt;/pre&gt;

There's also a bunch of other useful ones:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; dayofweek(birthday)
6
julia&gt; dayname(birthday)
&quot;Saturday&quot;
julia&gt; yearmonth(now())
(2014,9)
julia&gt; yearmonthday(birthday)
(1997,3,15)
julia&gt; isleapyear(birthday)
false
julia&gt; daysofweekinmonth(today())
5
julia&gt; monthname(birthday)
&quot;March&quot;
julia&gt; monthday(now())
(9,2)
julia&gt; dayofweekofmonth(birthday)
3 
&lt;/pre&gt;

That last function,  &lt;tt&gt;dayofweekofmonth(birthday)&lt;/tt&gt;, tells you that the 15th of March, 1997, was the third Saturday of the month.

===  Date arithmetic ===

You can do arithmetic on dates and date/time objects. Subtracting two dates to find the difference is the most obvious one:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; datetoday - birthday
6380 days
julia&gt; datetimenow - armistice
3023472252000 milliseconds
&lt;/pre&gt;

which you can convert to a number:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; int(datetoday - birthday)
6380
julia&gt; int(datetimenow - armistice) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24)
34993.891805555555
&lt;/pre&gt;

which is the number of days.

To add and subtract periods of time to date and date/time objects, use the &lt;tt&gt;Dates.*&lt;/tt&gt; constructors to specify the period. For example, &lt;tt&gt;Dates.Year(20)&lt;/tt&gt; defines a period of 20 years, and &lt;tt&gt;Dates.Month(6)&lt;/tt&gt; defines a period of 6 months. So, to add 20 years and 6 months to the birthday date:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; birthday + Dates.Year(20) + Dates.Month(6)
2017-09-15
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's 6 months ago from now: 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; now() - Dates.Month(6)
2014-03-02T16:43:08
&lt;/pre&gt;

and similarly for months, weeks:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; now() - Dates.Year(2) - Dates.Month(6)
2012-03-02T16:44:03
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Range of dates: ===

You can make iterable range objects that define a range of dates:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; d = [Date(1980,1,1):Month(3):Date(2015,1,1)]
141-element Array{Date,1}:
 1980-01-01
 1980-04-01
&lt;/pre&gt;

and, to find out which are weekdays, provide an anonymous function to &lt;tt&gt;filter&lt;/tt&gt; that tests the day name against the given day names:

&lt;pre&gt;weekdays = filter(dy -&gt; dayname(dy) != &quot;Saturday&quot; &amp;&amp; dayname(dy) != &quot;Sunday&quot; , d)&lt;/pre&gt;

Similarly, here's a range of times 3 hours apart from now, for a year hence:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; d = [DateTime(now()):Hour(3):DateTime(now() + Dates.Year(1))]
2921-element Array{DateTime,1}:
 2014-09-02T17:45:19
 2014-09-02T20:45:19
 2014-09-02T23:45:19

 2015-09-02T14:45:19
 2015-09-02T17:45:19
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Date formatting ===

To output a date in another format, use the &lt;tt&gt;Dates.format()&lt;/tt&gt; function.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Dates.format(DateTime(2014), DateFormat(&quot;e, dd u yyyy HH:MM:SS&quot;))
&quot;Wed, 01 Jan 2014 00:00:00&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The letters you supply in the format string determine which elements are output.

=== Date adjustments ===

Sometimes you want to find a date nearest to another - for example, the first day of that week, or the last day of the month that contains that date. You can do this with the functions like &lt;tt&gt;Dates.firstdayofweek()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Dates.lastdayofmonth()&lt;/tt&gt;. So, if we're currently in the middle of the week:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; dayname(now())
&quot;Wednesday&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

the first day of the week is returned by this:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Dates.firstdayofweek(now())
2014-09-01T00:00:00
&lt;/pre&gt;

A more general solution is provided by the &lt;tt&gt;tofirst()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;tolast()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;tonext()&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;toprev()&lt;/tt&gt; methods.

With &lt;tt&gt;tonext()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;toprev()&lt;/tt&gt;, you can provide a (possibly anonymous) function that returns true when a date has been correctly adjusted. For example, the function:

&lt;pre&gt;d-&gt;Dates.dayofweek(d) == Dates.Tuesday
&lt;/pre&gt;

returns true if the day d is a Tuesday. Use this with the tonext() method: 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Dates.tonext(d-&gt;Dates.dayofweek(d) == Dates.Tuesday, birthday)
1997-03-18
&lt;/pre&gt;

Or you can find the next Sunday following the birthday date.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Dates.tonext(d-&gt;Dates.dayname(d) == &quot;Sunday&quot;, birthday)
1997-03-16
&lt;/pre&gt;

— it was a Sunday the day after the 15th.

With &lt;tt&gt;tofirst()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;tolast()&lt;/tt&gt;, you supply the date, and the first day of that month is returned. Supply the keyword argument &lt;tt&gt;of=Year&lt;/tt&gt; to get the first day of that year.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Dates.tofirst(birthday, 1)
1997-03-03
julia&gt; Dates.tofirst(birthday, 1, of=Year)
1997-01-06
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Recurring dates ===

It's useful to be able to find all dates in a range of dates that satisfy some particular criteria. For example, you can work out the second Sunday in a month by using the &lt;tt&gt;Dates.dayofweekofmonth()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;Dates.dayname()&lt;/tt&gt; functions. If you supply these and a range of dates, the &lt;tt&gt;recur()&lt;/tt&gt; function can find recurring dates.

For example, let's create a range of dates from the first of September 2014 until Christmas Day, 2014:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; dr = Dates.Date(2014,9,1):Dates.Date(2014,12,25)
2014-09-01:1 day:2014-12-25&lt;/pre&gt;

Now an anonymous function similar to the ones we used in &lt;tt&gt;tonext()&lt;/tt&gt; earlier finds a selection of those dates that satisfy the function:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; recur(d-&gt;Dates.dayname(d) == &quot;Sunday&quot;,dr)
15-element Array{Date,1}:
 2014-09-14
 2014-09-21
 2014-09-28
 2014-10-05
 2014-10-12
 2014-10-19
 2014-10-26
 2014-11-02
 2014-11-09
 2014-11-16
 2014-11-23
 2014-11-30
 2014-12-07
 2014-12-14
 2014-12-21
&lt;/pre&gt;

These are the dates of every Sunday between now and Christmas.

By combining criteria in the anonymous function, you can build up more complicated recurring events. Here's a list of all the Tuesdays in the period which are on days that are prime numbers:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; recur(d-&gt;Dates.dayname(d) == &quot;Tuesday&quot; &amp;&amp; isprime(Dates.day(d)), dr)
6-element Array{Date,1}:
 2014-09-02
 2014-09-23
 2014-10-07
 2014-11-11
 2014-12-02
 2014-12-23&lt;/pre&gt;
 
=== Unix time===

You might have to deal with another type of timekeeping: Unix time. Unix time is a count of the number of seconds that have elapsed since the beginning of the year 1970 (the Unix epoch). In Julia the count is stored in a 64 bit integer, and we'll never see the end of Unix time. (The universe will have ended long before 64 bit Unix time reaches the maximum possible value, in approximately 292 billion years from now, at 15:30:08 on Sunday, 4 December 292,277,026,596.)

In Julia, the &lt;tt&gt;time()&lt;/tt&gt; function, used without arguments, returns the Unix time value of the current second:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; time()
1.414141581230945e9&lt;/pre&gt;


The &lt;tt&gt;strftime()&lt;/tt&gt; (&quot;string format time&quot;) function converts a number of seconds in Unix time to a more readable form:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; strftime(86400 * 365.25 * 4)
&quot;Tue  1 Jan 00:00:00 1974&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;


You can choose a different format by supplying a format string, with the different components of the date and time defined by '%' letter codes:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; strftime(&quot;%A, %B %e at %T, %Y&quot;, 86400 * 365.25 * 4)
&quot;Tuesday, January  1 at 00:00:00, 1974&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;strptime()&lt;/tt&gt; function takes a format string and a date string, and returns a TmStruct expression. This can then be converted to a Unix time value by passing it to &lt;tt&gt;time()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; strptime(&quot;%A, %B %e at %T, %Y&quot;, &quot;Tuesday, January  1 at 00:00:00, 1974&quot;)
TmStruct(0,0,0,1,0,74,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)
julia&gt; time(ans)
1.262304e8
julia&gt; time(strptime(&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;,&quot;2014-10-1&quot;))
1.4121216e9
&lt;/pre&gt;

Julia also offers a &lt;tt&gt;unix2datetime()&lt;/tt&gt; function, which converts a Unix time value to a date/time object:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; unix2datetime(time())
2014-10-24T09:26:29.305
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==  Plotting ==

There are a number of different packages for plotting in Julia. In most cases, adding a plotting package to Julia is going to involve adding and installing additional graphics libraries and components. Sometimes this goes well, sometimes it doesn't...

=== ASCIIPlots===

If you want a quick plot and can't wait while the bigger plotting packages load, use ASCIIPlots. You don't have to travel back in time to use a primitive monochrome terminal — you can plot using ASCII characters! You have a choice of three functions: &lt;tt&gt;scatterplot()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;lineplot()&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;imagesc()&lt;/tt&gt;. 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Pkg.add(&quot;ASCIIPlots&quot;)
julia&gt; using ASCIIPlots
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here's &lt;tt&gt;lineplot()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; lineplot([sin(x) for x in [0:0.1:2 * pi]])

	-------------------------------------------------------------
	|               -                                            | 1.00
	|           //-- \\\\                                        |
	|         //        \\                                       |
	|       //            \                                      |

	|   /                     \                                  |

	|                                  \                    //   |
	|                                   \                  /     |
	|                                    \                /      |
	|                                     \\            //       |
	|                                       \         //         |
	|                                        \\\---///           | -1.00

	1.00                                                    63.00
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== MatPlotLib===

If you're already familiar with MatLab, or Python's plotting environment, you should be happy with MatPlotLib.

=== Winston===

Winston &quot;offers an easy to use plot command to create figures without any fuss&quot;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Pkg.add(&quot;Winston&quot;)
julia&gt; using Winston
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Gadfly ===

And then there's Gadfly, which is possibly the most interesting of the plot libraries.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Pkg.add(&quot;Gadfly&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now's a good time to go for a coffee.

OK. You first want to load the Gadfly package:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; using Gadfly
&lt;/pre&gt;

and this can take a few seconds.

Most of your plotting work is going to involve using the plot() function. This has many different forms — it's &quot;overloaded&quot; so that it can plot the data in:

* functions
* arrays
* dataframes (provided by the DataFrames package)

The basic form of a plot instruction is:

&lt;pre&gt;plot(data, mappings, element1, element2, …)
&lt;/pre&gt;

where data is the function, array, or other data source, the 'mappings' are the symbol and assignments that link to the data, and the elements are the various options such as themes, scales, plot markers, labels, titles, and guides that you probably want to tweak and adjust to make the plot look amazing.

&lt;pre&gt;
julia&gt; p = plot(x=randn(2000), Geom.histogram(bincount=100))&lt;/pre&gt;

[[File:Julia-histogram.png|histogram plot created in Julia using Gadfly]]

===TODO===

* order doesn't really matter
* the mapping is called — oddly — aesthetics. 
* &quot;Aesthetics are a set of special named variables that are mapped to plot geometry. How this mapping occurs is defined by the plot elements.&quot;
* higher than functions, bind the x aesthetic to one thing, the y aesthetic to another aspect of data 
* statistics — how the data is summarized
* subplots takes type of plot as parameter
* labels are Guide objects

      <text xml:space="preserve">==  Metaprogramming ==

In Julia an expression is evaluated as soon as you type it in the REPL, or as soon as Julia executes your code from a file. Usually this is what you want to happen. However, it is occasionally useful to control exactly when an expression is evaluated, possibly delaying it for a while while you modify it. It's also useful to be able to write Julia code that writes more Julia code — you can automate tedious coding jobs, and make easy-to-use super-code that do things that would be hard to do in ordinary code.

===Quoted expressions===

There has to be a way to stop Julia evaluating something immediately. This is the colon prefix operator:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; x = 3
3
julia&gt; :x
:x 
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;tt&gt;:x&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is an unevaluated or quoted symbol. 

(If you're unfamiliar with the use of quoted symbols in computer programming, think of how quotes are sometimes used in writing to distinguish between ordinary use and special use. For example, in the sentence '&quot;Copper&quot; contains six letters, and is not a metal.', the quotes indicate that the quoted word &quot;Copper&quot; is not supposed to be a simple reference to the metal, but to the word.)

An alternative to using the colon to quote symbols is to enclose the Julia code in parentheses:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; :(x)
&lt;/pre&gt;

and this lets you quote more complicated expressions:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; :(2+2)

:(2 + 2)
&lt;/pre&gt;

There's an alternative form of the &lt;tt&gt;:( )&lt;/tt&gt; construction, using the quote …end keywords to define an expression:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt;expression = quote
           for i = 1:10 # line 2:
          println(i)
         end
       end
&lt;/pre&gt;

This quoted object is of type Expr:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; typeof(expression)
Expr
&lt;/pre&gt;

===Evaluating expressions===

There's also a function for evaluating an unevaluated expression. It's called &lt;tt&gt;eval()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; eval(:x)
3
julia&gt; eval(:(2 + 2))
4
julia&gt; eval(expression)
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
&lt;/pre&gt;

With these tools, it's now possible to create any expression and store it without having it evaluate:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; e = :(for i in 1:10
       println(i)
       end
      )
:(for i = 1:10 # line 2:
        println(i)
    end)
&lt;/pre&gt;

and then to recall and evaluate it later:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; eval(e)
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9
10
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Inside Expressions ===

Once you have Julia code in an unevaluated expression, rather than as a piece of text in a string, Julia can manipulate it herself.

Here's another expression:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; e = quote
           a = 2
           b = 3
           c = 4
           d = 5
           e = sum(a,b,c,d)
           end
quote  # none, line 2:
    a = 2 # line 3:
    b = 3 # line 4:
    c = 4 # line 5:
    d = 5 # line 6:
    e = sum(a,b,c,d)
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Use the &lt;tt&gt;names()&lt;/tt&gt; function to see what's inside this expression:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; names(e)
3-element Array{Symbol,1}:
 :head
 :args
 :typ
&lt;/pre&gt;

The args field is an array of expressions (including comments), and we can examine these using ordinary Julia code:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; for arg in e.args
              println(typeof(arg), &quot; &quot;,arg)
              end
Expr  # none, line 2:
Expr a = 2
LineNumberNode  # line 3:
Expr b = 3
LineNumberNode  # line 4:
Expr c = 4
LineNumberNode  # line 5:
Expr d = 5
LineNumberNode  # line 6:
Expr e = sum(a,b,c,d)
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you can see, the expression contains sub-expressions.

===  Expression interpolation ===

Just as the dollar sign (&lt;tt&gt;$&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;$(...)&lt;/tt&gt;) lets you insert Julia expressions into strings (see string interpolation), it also lets you insert expressions into other expressions.

Here's an expression:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; q = quote 2 + 2 end
quote  # none, line 1:
    2 + 2
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is how to insert an expression into an expression (an operation called &quot;splicing&quot;):

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; q = quote $:(2 + 3) + 2 end
quote  # none, line 1:
    (2 + 3) + 2
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

===  Macros ===

Once you know how to create and handle Julia expressions, you can modify them too. A macro is a way of generating an unevaluated output expression, given some unevaluated input expressions. When your Julia program runs, it evaluates the macro, and the input expressions are processed to produce the output expression, which is then executed just like an ordinary expression. 

So a macro is similar to a function, except that the expressions are unevaluated until the macro is executed. 

When you want a macro to be executed, call it like a function, but an &lt;b&gt;&lt;tt&gt;@&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/b&gt; character.

Here is a macro that simply prints out the arguments of an expression that's passed to it, and then evaluates the expression as well:

&lt;pre&gt;macro p(n)
    if typeof(n) == Expr 
       println(n.args)
    end
    eval(n)
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

To run the macro, call it with the &lt;tt&gt;@&lt;/tt&gt; prefix:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; @p(3)
3
&lt;/pre&gt;

Numbers are not expressions, so they're not printed twice. But if you pass an expression: 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; @p(3 + 4 - 5 * 6 / 7 % 8)
{:-,:(3 + 4),:(((5 * 6) / 7) % 8)}
2.7142857142857144
&lt;/pre&gt;

before the result is printed, you can see the expression as an array of expressions after being parsed by Julia but before being executed. You can see how the different precedence of arithmetic operators has been taken into account in the parsing operation. 

Notice also that the operator symbols are quoted with a colon (&lt;tt&gt;:&lt;/tt&gt;), as are the subexpressions.

=== Expanding macros ===

To see what the macro expands to when it's finally executed, use the &lt;tt&gt;macroexpand()&lt;/tt&gt; function. It expects an unevaluated expression containing one or more macro calls, which are then expanded into proper Julia code for you so that you can see what the macro would do when called.

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; macroexpand(quote @p(3 + 4 - 5 * 6 / 7 % 8) end)
{:-,:(3 + 4),:(((5 * 6) / 7) % 8)}
begin  # none, line 1:
    2.7142857142857144
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

(The &lt;tt&gt;#none, line 1:&lt;/tt&gt; is a filename and line number reference that is more useful when used inside a source file rather than when you're using the REPL.)

===  Another example ===

The &lt;tt&gt;@time&lt;/tt&gt; macro is provided with Julia as a convenient way for timing expressions. Although there are complications and refinements, the basic idea of this macro is to record the start time, evaluate the expression, record the finish time, and then print the time difference.

Let's extend the idea and write a simple macro that does something similar for a series of expressions. Suppose you want to take a series of expressions and have each one evaluated in turn, but you want to find out how long each one took. Obviously, it's important that each expression is evaluated after a timer is started, and that this timer should stop, when each expression has finished, and then restart for the next one.

So here's a list of expressions:

&lt;pre&gt;e = quote
  a = sind([0:10000])
  b = sqrt([1:100])
  c = rand(5,50)
  d = randn(5,50)
end
&lt;/pre&gt;

The macro to do the step by step timed evaluation accepts an expression:

&lt;pre&gt;macro etimer(exp)
   quote
         for arg in $exp.args
             start = time_ns()
             result = eval(arg)
             print(&quot;$(time_ns() - start) nanoseconds&quot;) 
             println(&quot; for $arg &quot;)
         end
     end
   end
&lt;/pre&gt;

the dollar sign interpolates code into the &lt;tt&gt;quote&lt;/tt&gt;...&lt;tt&gt;end&lt;/tt&gt; expression and can be run as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; @etimer(e)&lt;/pre&gt;

The output is something like this:

&lt;pre&gt;22590 nanoseconds for  # untitled text, line 4: 
20421111 nanoseconds for a = sind([0:10000]) 
444 nanoseconds for  # line 5: 
6197230 nanoseconds for b = sqrt([1:100]) 
457 nanoseconds for  # line 6: 
6110203 nanoseconds for c = rand(5,50) 
499 nanoseconds for  # line 7: 
20462713 nanoseconds for d = randn(5,50) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

(This is the first run, when Julia executes the code and then compiles it; the second and subsequent runs are faster.)

== Hi all ==

I was surfing the web and came across wikibooks, I kinda looked at my field of expertise in Geology, Engineering Geology and Geotechnical Engineering. The books were started but nobody has made an edit in over 3 years and looking at the edits more like that nobody has made a sincere effort in the fields since the inception of wikibooks. Since I'm studying for Masters in Engineering Geology at the University of New South Wales, I might contribute to Wikibooks while studying for the subjects. It might help me achieve my postgrad degree in the end. I kinda want to make two books. An Introduction to Engineering Geology and the other into An Introduction to Geotechnical Engineering. The two fields are related, one leans more towards Geology the other to Civil Engineering. I'll start with Engineering Geology that focuses on geology and geological hazards such as landslides, earthquakes etc. Geotechnical Engineering is all about quantifying rocks, soils and groundwater, to build structures on. If you want to check out my resume click  [http://www.jokic.co here] to find out my qualifications.

It might take a few years to finish the books as its a complex topic, that most people might find alien, but its foundational to our way of life. Excuses the pun.

I'll give it my best shot.

Cheers

== Automatic PDF/ePUB download links (or collection shortcut) ==

At the moment, generating an ePUB ebook can only be done by manually adding each page of the book to a collection (which can be an error-prone process if you miss subpages) and downloading the resulting ePUB file from the collection manager.

For PDF files, some books seem to have had their PDF generated and uploaded as a static file (I gather this from the URL of said files). Which would mean that the PDF file becomes obsolete after the first edition of the book.

What would be the technical difficulty of having at least a link that gets the user to the collection manager pre-filled with the pages? Also, a few links for the most obvious choices in options would be great, at least 1-column PDF and ePUB.

--[[User:Nowhere man|Nowhere man]] ([[User talk:Nowhere man|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Nowhere man|contribs]]) 13:15, 14 March 2014 (UTC)

I'm a little confused by your question. When I look at, for example, the [[German]] Wikibook,
all the way at the bottom on the right side it says &quot;This book has a collection&quot;
that already has &quot;a link that gets the user to the collection pre-filled with the pages&quot;.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/DavidCary|contribs]]) 14:06, 4 April 2014 (UTC)

I agree with [[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]], that if I see, it shows both the [[German/Print version|printable]] version and the [[Wikibooks:Collections/German|collection]] link. You can also render a [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Collection/render_collection/&amp;colltitle=Wikibooks:Collections/German| pdf] version. Also, I am unsure of just one thing. I have myself downloaded a [[User:Harrybrowne1986/Collections/German Complete WikiBook| pdf]] book, however, what I cannot understand is that, the way the book is written, is not complete, neither comprehensive. Please understand I mean no harm, or mean any bad thing for the person who gave tremendous efforts behind this project. I am currently trying to modify and rectify as much as I can, and add as much as I know. I am myself learning the language, but I have got the complete resource from start of the course to the end of it, so it should cause me no trouble. I wish all my friends a hearty congratulations, and my full support for all the things that go towards doing such a great thing. Danke.

::BTW, can anyone suggest me how to get the earlier PDF version deleted, and how to generate a new one, since the old one is quite redundant and is also obsolete with me making quite a number of changes to the chapters.

::Hello [[User:QuiteUnusual|Quite]]. Thanks for this. However, when I stated that comment, I meant it myself that it was unfinished, but still there was a PDF version released for it, with lots of grammatical errors, and in an unfinished stage that too, which was literally left out by the editors. Currently, I am trying to get it back in a proper manner as much as I can, and that I why I wished to know of the way to get a PDF file for it. Although I will say that I am not too sure of how to amend the print version to show it properly, but I believe that it will be at a later stage that I will look at it, since, first I need to complete the actual book and also the BLL one.

Hallo. Mein name ist Vishal Bakhai. Although I am fairly new to the project books, but I have started amending and upgrading the German books section, as the [[German]] books have not had a revision in near past.

== A public book watchlist hack ==

A few months ago, we [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Proposals/2013/November#SubpageWatchlist|discussed]] alternatives to deal with the problem of watching whole books and, in particular, book talk pages. I have been using the workaround suggested at [[w:Help:Public watchlist]] (i.e. place all links in a page and then use Related Changes) for a while, but only now I had a shot at making updates to the watchlist automatic. I took [[m:Module:Subpages]] (apparently an experiment by darklama), which gets the output of [[Special:PrefixIndex]] and strips the HTML around the page titles, made a few adjustments to it and used its output to fill in [[Template:La2]] entries. The result is [[Module:PublicSubpageWatchlist]], and [[User:Duplode/Automatic public watchlist|here is a demonstration of it]]. Before I wrap it in a template and use it at the Haskell book, I would like to put it up for discussion, so that any possible issues are identified. In particular, I have no real idea whether widespread usage might be problematic performance-wise (I suppose the text processing is nothing out of ordinary, and what might matter are the calls to Special:PrefixIndex).

[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 19:04, 11 May 2014 (UTC)

: A few versions are floating about with various changes to reflect issues I missed from my initial quick &quot;proof of concept&quot; hack, like that redirects are included when they might not want to be, when there are a sufficient number of subpages not every subpage got listed, or when used in a namespace without the subpage featured enabled it should abort unless explicitly overridden. Those changes also come at a price, requires more time which can lead to exceeding the allocated time limit that Lua scripts can run on a page, and more complexity which can lead to exceeding the allocated complexity limit. See [[Commons:Module:Page]] for example. It might be possible improve the speed and reduce the complexity, but there should probably be a warning that it may fail in some cases. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:21, 13 May 2014 (UTC)

== Importing BSD licenced material? ==

Hello, I'm just wondering if it's acceptable to import a [http://www.linfo.org/bsdlicense.html BSD (3-clause) licenced] software manual to Wikibooks? Would I just need to retain the licence (perhaps with something like &quot;this book was based on material licenced under the BSD&quot; etc.) on a subpage?

:The BSD license only protects source code and its binary form, it is not suitable for literary works, so you should contact the copyright owner for re-licensing if possible as the freedoms of the BSD license indicate that the intention was to make it free and only preserving the rights of acknowledgement something that our license does.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:48, 23 May 2014 (UTC)

== Enhancing a Published Bibliography through Social Editing: is this the right place? ==

May I seek your opinion on the appropriateness of creating a Wikibooks edition of an academic research work we are about to publish?

''In the Lands of the Romanovs''  by Anthony Cross is a large annotated bibliography of over 1200 English-language accounts of the Russian Empire written during the period 1613-1917. The title is published by Open Book Publishers under a CC BY license, is freely available to read and download (in HTML format) from the OBP website, and will also be made freely available from outlets such as Google Books, [http://www.worldreader.org/ Worldreader] etc. The book is also available in printed hardback and paperback editions and in various e-book formats, all of which will be retailed from our own and other sites (e.g. Amazon).

We (Open Book Publishers) would like to create a socially enhanced version of the book, and encourage readers to add new entries and create links to existing resources. In this way we believe that the content of this wide-ranging and ambitious work could be made even more comprehensive and useful for the scholarly community. We see Wikibooks as the perfect place for an edition of this kind, following in the footsteps of other social editing projects like ''[[The Devonshire Manuscript]]''.

Before loading the work onto Wikibooks, however, we want to seek your feedback, and know whether you feel this is appropriate. In alternative, we are planning to create a private wiki on our own website, but we would much prefer to host the title here!

If you wish to have a look at the book, you can visit [http://www.openbookpublishers.com/wiki/index.php?title=In_the_Lands_of_the_Romanovs_by_Anthony_Cross  this page]. Please note that this is just a prototype, provisionally built to test conversion into [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki_markup wiki markup], and that some minor parts of the book are still missing (front matters, introduction, bibliography and index). The HTML edition of the complete work can also be viewed from [http://openbookpublishers.com/htmlreader/978-1-78374-057-4/main.html our website].

Lastly, some background about Open Book Publishers. We are a non-profit, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_access Open Access] publisher, committed to making high-quality research freely available to readers around the world. Founded by academics we have now published over 40 titles in the humanities and social sciences – all of which are free to read and download from our website. We have already loaded [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Oral_Literature_in_the_Digital_Age:_Archiving_Orality_and_Connecting_with_Communities one of our books] onto [https://en.wikisource.org Wikisource], which however does not allow social editing of texts.

: I think the book may be appropriate at Wikibooks or Wikiversity depending on its contents and how you want it to develop further. You mention academic research. Is the book the primary source of information for academic research done about the Russian Empire, or does the book instruct people in the history of the Russian Empire with citations from academic research that has been previously published in peer reviewed academic journals? Do you want people to expand the book by engaging and adding their own research to the book, or do you want people to add their own annotations and interpretations of the history of the Russian Empire to the book? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:29, 3 May 2014 (UTC)

:: Thanks for your feedback. We expect the book will be used as a reference tools for those undertaking primary research into the Russian Empire during the reign of the Romanovs, or by people like auction houses and collectors of books from the period. It is not an instructional text and, other than the introduction, does not contain footnotes. It is primarily a long list of works written during the period, comments about the importance and significance of some individual works are made as part of the description of each work but it does not provide an interpretation of Russian history over the period. As a research tool we envisage it being expanded by people adding: bibliographic entries about new works that come to light, or the author had not been aware of; links to digitalized versions of the works identified, as increasing numbers of them become digitalized; ISBNs so as to allow the wiki 'find this book' function to operate, or alternative links to discovery engines such as Worldcat etc; expanded descriptions of the works identified; links between works by date, location, person etc. As a bibliography it would not be an appropriate venue for interpretations of history - but an invaluable resource for researchers to discover primary sources on which to form and justify interpretations. --&lt;span&gt;[[User:Openbookpublishers|Openbookpublishers]] ([[User talk:Openbookpublishers|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Openbookpublishers|contribs]])&lt;/span&gt; 09:25, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

::: [[The Devonshire Manuscript]] seems to instruct people in the history of the manuscript and the people believed to be connected with the manuscript's development and lots of other information that people may want to know when learning about the manuscript. Wikibooks is primarily for books that educate people through instruction. People would have to read the bibliographic sources to learn anything about the Russian Empire. I think the primary benefit to Wikibooks is in the wealth of sources listed in ''In the Lands of the Romanovs'' that people can cite in books about the Russian Empire. Sounds to me like ''In the Lands of the Romanovs'' is more appropriate at Wikiversity where historians, educators, and learners may benefit from reading and contributing new bibliographic sources. ''In the Lands of the Romanovs'' may have more in common with [[v:Other Free Learning Resources|Other Free Learning Resources]] (Wikiversity) than any books at Wikibooks. I may be overlooking other perspectives though, hopefully other people will comment. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:29, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

::::I guess that much depends on whether we want to stress the fact that ''In the Lands of the Romanovs'' is a book, or rather present it as a learning/teaching tool. But you are absolutely right when you say that it does not instruct people on the Russian Empire: it is a source to find books on the topic. As such, it is probably more appropriate to Wikiversity, as you suggest. When referring to [[The Devonshire Manuscript]] I have in mind the collaborative dimension of that project, and the stress they place on social editing, which is what we are hoping to achieve. But I see that Wikiversity emphasises collaborative editing as much as Wikibooks does.

I am considering doing a wikibook on Database Management Systems for this term at university. Instead of simply making notes, I thought why not create something that can be read by everyone. My aim will be to create a comprehensive conceptual book with examples with the different DBMS in existence. This is a huge undertaking and I definitely will be looking out for volunteers who have expertise on DBMS. 

One question I have is about copyright. I am completely new to the wiki world and want to know if I need to explicitly ask permission of the authors of a publication or whether properly attributing them is simply enough. 

About the project, any suggestions on whether to include different types of databases - document-oriented, object-oriented, graph etc. or to concentrate on RDBMS. I could later on take it up as different projects. 

I can explain the project in more detail, if you have any questions.

: The copyright issue is actually very simple, – to copy a substantial piece of text from a work to Wikibooks it’s ''required'' that either:
:# the work is already released under the [//creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0 CC BY-SA 3.0] (or CC BY) license;
:# the author (or some other person the author has transferred copyright to, as in: his or her employer or publisher) agrees to release the work under that license ''and'' confirms such a decision via an email to OTRS;
:# the work is in the [[w:Public domain|public domain,]] – which in this case would mean that it’s either a work of the US government, or was explicitly released to the public domain by the author.

: As a rule of the thumb, if the work is only available for a fee (say, from the publisher’s Web site), it’s unlikely that the copyright holder will re-release it under CC BY-SA or CC BY.

: Naturally, one can freely borrow ''ideas'' from existing works, as long as the actual ''text'' is written anew.

: As for the “RDBMS or more” question – just start with a smaller goal, for it’s always possible to expand the scope of the book, possibly renaming it in the process.

Thanks for the reply. So I gather I can borrow some ideas, as long as I use my own words. However, if I have to directly quote a sentence or two in between, is it enough to cite it?

I will follow your suggestion and start with a single topic on RDBMS and then expand, depending on the time I have and the number of volunteers I get.

: My understanding is that directly quoting a few sentences is acceptable, as long as you attribute the source, ''and'' your own text related to these sentences is no smaller than the quotation itself.  — [[User:Ivan Shmakov|Ivan Shmakov]] ([[User talk:Ivan Shmakov|d]] ▞ [[Special:Contributions/Ivan Shmakov|c]]) 07:44, 9 May 2014 (UTC)</text>

* design and structure web pages using correct HTML tags, such as paragraph, heading, list, and image
* draw a page by tracing its HTML source code

=What is HTML?=
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML HTML] (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for defining web pages, which serve as the interfaces to your web applications. HTML files are plain-text files following the HTML syntax. A browser knows how to take an HTML file and display in a browser window the page defined by the HTML file. The file can be stored locally on the computer the browser is running on or fetched from a web server using a URL. Creating HTML files is coding because the result source code gets executed by a browser, which is a virtual machine.  

=Tags Define the Page Structure =
An HTML file consists of content marked-up by tags as shown in this picture: 

[[File:HTML.svg|300px|HTML]] [[File:DOM tree.svg|300px|A DOM tree showing the nested structure of an HTML file.]] 

The tag at the beginning of the file is special as it is used to indicate the standard the file is following. &lt;code&gt;&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;&lt;/code&gt; means HTML5 - the latest HTML standard, which some new features. You can copy and paste this tag to every HTML file you create. 

Most tags appear in pairs - an opening tag and a closing tag. Each pair of tags defines an element for the web page, which can be visible or invisible. The visible elements are like boxes. All boxes hold some content and some boxes can contain other boxes. For instance, the &lt;code&gt;&lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/code&gt; defines the root (highest level) element, which should enclose everything else in your HTML file. Inside the &quot;html&quot; element we have a &quot;head&quot; element and a &quot;body&quot; element defined by their corresponding tags. Inside the &quot;head&quot; element is a &quot;title&quot; element and inside the &quot;body&quot; element is a &quot;paragraph&quot; element defined by the &lt;code&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag pair. Both the &quot;title&quot; element and the &quot;paragraph&quot; element have text as their content. This type of nested structure resembles a tree. In fact, a browser always parse an HTML file first into a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model DOM] object (a tree data structure) before it draws the page on the screen. Note that the &lt;code&gt;&lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag defines a comment, which is used for documentation and has no effect to the page. The figure to the right depicts the tree structure defined by the nested tags in the HTML file. 

We call elements that enclose other elements parent elements and enclosed elements children elements. Obviously a child element must be completed enclosed in its parent element, which means the tags must be properly nested. For instance, the following HTML fragment is confusing to a browser because the two elements are intermingled: 
&lt;source lang=&quot;html5&quot;&gt;
&lt;em&gt; emphasized and&lt;bold&gt;bold-faced&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/bold&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

We call elements block elements if they can contain other elements. For example, a paragraph (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) element and a list (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) element are block elements and they usually occupy multiple lines on the page. All other elements are called inline elements. Some tags are self-closing, e.g. the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; defines a linebreak, which is necessary because all space characters in HTML are ignored by browsers. Some tags allows us to define additional attributes for the elements, e.g. &lt;code&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;MyPicture.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/code&gt; defines a image at location specified by the &quot;src&quot; attribute. Each attribute is a name and value pair with the value in double quotes. As you can see from this example, images are embedded into web pages by using the &lt;code&gt;&lt;img&gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag that points to the images and the actual images are not part of the HTML file. This is an example of an external component, which also includes CSS and JavaScript files. Such external components must be downloaded separately and incorporated into the web pages.

Here is an example showing all kinds of elements and what they appear on a web page. Right click on the page and select &quot;view source code&quot; to see what's inside the page's HTML source file.

The best way to learn HTML is to study examples and tweak them to meet your needs. Our goal is to be able to draw mental pictures of a page by looking at the HTML source file. In other words we want to understand the relationship between what we write in an HTML file and what will appear on the page so that we can imagine and create web pages.

=Essental Tags=

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Web and Web Programming=
==The Web and the Internet==
What is the Web? Known as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web World Wide Web] the web is an application or service running on the Internet, which is the infrastructure (information superhighway -  a delivery mechanism). The Internet is a interconnect global network of computer networks, which is like a postal system which allows us to deliver mail pieces of all kinds with &quot;the web&quot; as one of them. Initially the web is designed to be a distributed [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext hyper-text] document sharing system. Now it has evolved to become a platform for distributed applications. Thinks about all the web applications you use, e.g. Google search  engine, Amazon web store, and Youtube.

==The Client-server Model==
The Web is based on a simple client server model. As shown in the figure a client sends a request and the server responds by sending a response back. 

[[File:Client-server model.svg|In a simple client-server model a client sends a request and gets a response back. The client always initiate the interaction.]]

It is a rather simple model, but we can build powerful application with this simple model.

Both clients and servers are software entities but both run on hardware platforms. The same hardware platform can have multiple software entities running on it. Normally a web client is a web browser, e.g. IE, Firefox, or Chrome, and a web client is a web server, e.g. Apache and IIS. The boundary between a web client and a web server is blurred when a web server consumes web services offered by other web servers and hence become a client to them. 

Every web application has two components: the client side and the server side. There are programming frameworks (e.g. Google App Engine) available for writing web  applications as one piece by automatically generating the client side. We will manually manage the two components to get a better understanding of web basics.  

===HTTP===
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP HTTP] stands for the Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, which is an agreed upon standard (set of rules) for communicating on the web. It is like a language and any program that speaks the language can a member of the web as a client, a server, or both. Each service that runs on the Internet has it own protocol, such as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IMAP IMAP] for email retrieval, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTP FTP] for file transfer, and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SNMP SNMP] for managing networks. 

===API=== 
You don't need to master the HTTP protocol in order to create web applications. Web APIs (Application Programming Interface) allows us to focus on the application logic by abstracting away the details of the common tasks (plumbing). As shown in the figure an API provides a higher-level abstraction of the detailed mechanisms. 

[[File:Web Programming API.svg|APIs available on both the client side and the server side makes Web programming easier allowing programmers to build web application on top of a high-level interface.]]  

For instance, we as programmer rarely need deal with HTTP directly and sending a request and receiving a response is as simple as making a function call.

===URL===
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL URL] (Universal Resource Locator) is also known as web address. Any resource available on the Web is identified by an URL, which has to be unique globally.

The following figure shows an example URL pointing to a file (resource) on a web server:

[[File:URL example.svg|Every URL has three components: the protocol, the ID of the server, and the path to the resource on the server.]]

When the URL is sent to the server, the server will map the rest of the URL - &lt;tt&gt;/~blu/helloworld.html&lt;/tt&gt; - to a path in the server's file system: &lt;tt&gt;/home/blu/public_html/helloworld.html&lt;/tt&gt;. In other words, whatever is after &lt;tt&gt;/~blu/&lt;/tt&gt; gets appended to &lt;tt&gt;/home/blu/&lt;/tt&gt; to be used to find the resource (file) on the server.

===&quot;Hello World!&quot; Example===
In the previous example, if the following text is in the helloworld.html file you would have seen the text appeared in the browser window after you typed in the URL in the address bar and hit enter.

&lt;code&gt;
Hello World!
&lt;/code&gt;

Sending a URL via a browser triggers a request a GET request to the server for the resource identified in the URL. The response to the request is the content of the file. This is the simplest example showing how the client-server model works.</text>

==CSS Syntax==
CSS stands for [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets Cascading Style Sheet]. A CSS file is an external/additional file attached to an HTML file for styling the web page. Note that the syntax for CSS files is different from the HTML syntax. A CSS file consists of a set of rules, when applied, will affect the look and feel of the page it associates with. Each rule starts with a selector that will select a number of elements on the page and the body of the rule specifies which property should have what value. For example, the following rule selects all paragraph elements and set the text color to red and center align the text in the paragraphs. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;CSS&quot;&gt;
p {
     color: red;
     text-align: center;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
You can see the running example at [http://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_syntax1].

As shown in the example, the body of a rule can have a number of statements/declarations terminated by &quot;;&quot;. Each statement is a property name and value pair (delimited by a &quot;:&quot;).

There are three ways of attaching a style sheet to a file:
* external style sheet file (pointed to by a &lt;link&gt; element in the &lt;head&gt;)
* internal style sheet (as a &lt;style&gt; element in the &lt;head&gt; )
* inline style (as attributes of elements)

The following example shows how an external CSS file is linked to an HTML. For other examples visit [http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_howto.asp CSS Howtos].
&lt;source lang=&quot;CSS&quot;&gt;
...
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; type=&quot;text/css&quot; href=&quot;mystyle.css&quot;&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
...
&lt;/source&gt;

==Cascading Rule==
CSS rules can also be embedded into HTML code as the &quot;style&quot; attribute (inline style) for tags or as a script element in the head element. What happens if we have multiple rules specified in different places but all of them affecting the same element on the page? This is where the cascading (precedence) rule comes play. The following are CSS locations in a descending order in terms of their priorities:
# rules in the style attribute of a tag
# rules in the script elements in the head
# rules in an external CSS file
# rules inherited to from parent elements
# rules known to the browser as default

For example, the inline styles will always take precedence over other styles. If there is no inline style set for an element the browser will attempt to use CSS rules in the script element.

When two rules from the same location set the same property to different values it is a conflict, which is resolved by leting a more tightly matching rule override a more general inherited rule and if the two rules match equally tightly the one appears last in the source to take effect and . 

==CSS Pseudo-classes==
Pseduo-classes allow us to apply styles to elements at a particular state, for instance the following rule only takes effect on the selected elements when they are moused over.
&lt;source lang=&quot;CSS&quot;&gt;
a:hover {
  background-color: red;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==CSS3 Features==
CSS2 added new selectors, such as nth-child, inline-block, :not, +, and the ability to embed fonts in a page. It also provides built-in support for multi-column layouts, transparency/opacity, color gradients, shadows, rounded corners/borders, border-radius, animations/transitions, and affine transformations (scaling, rotation, perspective).</text>

=Box Model=
All HTML elements are drawn as boxes according to the [http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp box model]. Each box has the following property we can set: the [http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_dimension.asp dimension]  of the content area (height and width), the [http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_padding.asp padding], the [http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_border.asp border], and the [http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_margin.asp margin]. 

Layout determines the relative position of the elements/boxes on a page. The default layout (document/normal flow) simply stack the block elements and use a &quot;flow layout&quot; to position the children elements in a parent element. This is the default way to determine the positions of the elements.

There are three methods to change the default position of an element: [http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_align.asp aligning, floating, and positioning]. To relocate an element to a desired position, we should try to use alignment first because it is the simplest method and try using positioning last as it most obtrusive.   

=Aligning=
To horizontally align content in a block element we can set the [http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_text-align.asp text-align] property for the block element. The vertical alignment of an inline element within its containing element can be changed by setting the [http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_vertical-align.asp vertical-align] property for the inline element. The inline element should be aligned vertically with respect to other content on the same line within the same containing element.

Block elements can be center on page by setting their width property and set their left and right margins to &quot;auto&quot;.  
A block with its width set can be pushed to the left or to the right by making it float.

=Floating=
You can use the [http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_float.asp float] property to take an element out of the normal layout (flow ) and push it either to the left or the right. The element's vertical position is the same as  the vertical position it would be in the normal layout. If a float element is above some text, the browser will wrap the text around the floating element. A floating element normally have its width property set because otherwise it would take the available horizontal space appearing not floating.

A floating child element stays inside its parent element, i.e. the enclosing relationship, which is physical, doesn't change. A floating child element may hang out of its parent's box because it doesn't take into account the floating children elements. The [http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_pos_overflow.asp overflow] property determines what happens when the content overflows an element's box. The [http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_class_clear.asp clear] property, when set on an element, will push the element down to avoid (&quot;stay clear&quot;) of floating elements to the left or to the right.

=Positioning=
The CSS positioning properties allows us to set an element with offsets relative to a reference point, which differentiates the four positioning methods. 
* static: default position
* relative: relative to the default position
* absolute: relative to the containing element, which must have the position property set to a non-default value
* fixed: relative to the browser window

The offsets can be left, right, top, and bottom.</text>

A container type tag for defining asset sounds. Soundscript containers have the ability to control 'relative loudness', fading range, randomness-ranges, and to have a specific trigger. 

==Supported Tags==
Each soundscript subcontainer supports the following tags. Each tag is shown here with its default value.

{| style=&quot;vertical-align: top; background:#feecc9; border:1px solid blue;&quot;
!colspan=2| Specification vs. Example
|-
|width=333|
soundscript
{
  repeat-delay  0,0
  distance      50,150
  ambient       0
  attachment    &quot;&quot;
  nostartdelay  0
  priority      1
  trigger       &quot;&quot;
  volume        1
  value-range   0,0
  sound
  {
  }
}
| style=&quot;background:#feecc9&quot;|

soundscript
{
  dayloop
  {
    ambient 1
    repeat-delay                        20
    distance                            10,100
    
    sound
    {
      dogbark.wav                       
      lildogbark.wav                       
      bigdogbark.wav                       
      dogsallbark.wav                       
    }
  }
} &lt;small&gt;(adapted: KB dogbark,&lt;kuid:52682:39098&gt;)&lt;/small&gt;
|}
====ambient====
:Type: '''Boolean''' &amp;mdash; values other than 1 &amp; 0 generate a Fault message!
:Default: 0
:Compulsory: No
:Desc: If true this is an 'ambient' sound, ambient sounds are played in 2D and do not make use of 3D positioning in the world other than to affect volume. Unlike positional sounds, ambient sounds may be stereo.

====attachment====
:Type: Attachment point
:Default: &quot;&quot;
:Compulsory: No
:Desc: Point to attach the sound source to. Attachment points are specified in the mesh file during creation.
Why should a sound not have an attachment point, asks Matilda, Georgie, and Millicent. Why when the sound is placed as'' 'audible scenery' about the route trackage'' by the route-builder, much as he might place a tree. Like a visual effect, a sound effect is used by the modeler to give a taste, and impression of reality&amp;mdash; for no two second sound file can mimic the reality of continuous sound. 
&amp;nbsp; 

====distance====
:Type: '''Decimal Pair''' &amp;mdash; meters: radius_Begin_fading, radius_cut_off_&amp;_stop
:Default: 50,150 
:Compulsory: No
:Desc: Distance range ''from the source'', in &lt;u&gt;meters&lt;/u&gt;, where the sound is audible. 
* The minimum distance defines the radius within which the sound remains at 100% volume.
* Beyond that distance, the sound volume will begin to decay naturally. 
* The maximum distance defines a radius beyond which the game will no longer play the sound. ''This does not mean that the sound fading out behavior is scaled to this value so that it will fade to zero by the maximum distance'', but {{Col|rather that the sound will cut off abruptly at that point|blue}}.{{TTip| It is up to the content creator to choose an appropriate distance - smaller is better for performance, because the sooner an assets radius of effect is passed, the sooner the CPU's process flow can drop it from the loop cycle and give attention to other things. Frame Rate Griper's take note! That nifty sound has a cost.}}

====nostartdelay====
:Type: '''Boolean'''
:Default: 0
:Compulsory: No
:Desc: If added and true this tag specifies that the sound will play immediately once triggered. By default sounds have a random start delay between 0 &amp; 4 seconds. Start delay should be left active in most cases, as turning it off may cause significant audio artifacts when several identical sounds are in proximity.

====priority====
:Type: '''Integer''' 
:Desc: Sets the priority of the sound, if their are not enough sound channels available higher priority sounds will be played first. Defaults to 1, can be negative.

====repeat-delay====
:Type: Decimal Pair
:Default: 0,0
:Compulsory: Yes (3.4)
:Desc: Time range (in seconds) to delay, after the sound finishes playing, before playing the sound again. To set a constant delay either set both these values the same or only provide one of them, otherwise a random value between them will be chosen. When used with a trigger event (see the 'trigger' tag), a positive value indicates that the sound should not repeat, but should wait until triggered again.

====sound====
:Type: Container
:Default: {}
:Compulsory: Yes
:Desc: Contains a key/string list of the sound files to play. If the list has more than one entry then one file will be picked at random from the list.  The value of each tag in this container is the filename of a WAV sound file.  Filenames are relative to the base directory of the asset, i.e. relative to the location of the config file.  The keys used within the list are not important: Trainz convention for lists like this is to numerically number each option from zero, and while it is strongly recommended to follow this convention, there is no technical requirement to do so.

:Valid WAV files are:
:* Uncompressed.
:* 8 or 16 bit
:* Mono, Stereo or Surround (As of build 3.7 Surround is not fully tested)

:Sampling rate can be 22kHz (22,050Hz) or 44kHz (44,100Hz).  The higher sampling rate doubles the size of the file for no significant improvement in quality, and is not recommended.  For some purposes there are additional requirements - for instance directional sounds must be mono.

====trigger====
:Type: String
:Default: &quot;&quot;
:Compulsory: No
:Desc: The 'trigger' tag gives your sound a name that can allow it to be played from [[Scripting|TrainzScript]], animations and certain predefined events. (At least one of these &quot;predefined events&quot; is to use the word &quot;toggle&quot; when including a soundscript container in the config.txt of a &quot;MOjunction&quot;.  This will make the sound fire each time the turnout is switched)

====value-range====
:Type: Float pair
:Default: 0,0 (off)
:Compulsory: No
:Desc: 2 numbers, where the numbers are not the same, which set the start and end times for the sound to play. Midnight is 0.5, midday = 0.0 or 1.0. (TBD.  This is a bit vague.)

====volume====
:Type: Decimal
:Default: 1
:Compulsory: No
:Desc: Specifies the volume gain of the sound. Defaults to 1 (100%).


==Example Config.txt==
Sample {{TR|R|config.txt file}} for a map asset that has a different day and night background sounds:

  kind map
  kuid &lt;KUID2:497853:13052:3&gt;
  soundscript
  {
    morning
    {
      ambient 1
      value-range 1, 0.1
      volume 0.3
      sound
      {
        0 ctry_day_1.wav
        1 ctry_day_2.wav
      }
    }
    night
    {
      ambient 1
      value-range 0, 0.9
      volume 0.3
      sound
      {
        0 night_loop.wav
      }
    }
  }

===Definition===
* Tendinitis is an inflammation of a tendon or tendon attachment
* Tendinitis in the shoulder can occur in the following. Tendons:
o The supraspinatus tendon
o The infraspinatus
o The subscapularis
o Teres minor tendon
o biceps tendon (the long head)
* Rotatorcuff'en made ​​up of four muscles (supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis, and teres minor) that coordinates and stabilizes the shoulder movements. In addition, the biceps, which also helps to stabilize the shoulder. Rotator cuff syndrome is the term for inflammation of one or more of rotatorcuffens tendons, most commonly the supraspinatus tendon. By supraspinatusseneaffektion are often seen simultaneously subacromial bursitis. Clinically, it may be difficult to distinguish between tendinitis in supraspinatus- and biceps tendon

===Occurrence===

* Shoulder pain occurs in 7-34% of the general population and in approximately 20% of people over 70 years. In studies of exposed groups found the prevalence of rotator cuff syndrome between 4 and 31% in control groups found prevalence between 1 and 9% &lt;ref&gt;Frost P, Andersen JH. Shoulder impingement syndrome in relation two shoulder intensive work. Occup Environ Med 1999; 56: 494-498.&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;Kuipers T, van der Windt DA, van der Heijden GJ, Bouter LM .. Suste Matic review of prognostic cohort studies on shoulder disorders. Pain 2004; 109: 420-431.PubMed&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;Svendsen SW, Bonde JP, Mathiassen SE, Stensgaard-Pedersen K, Frich LH .. Work related shoulder disorders: quantitative exposure-response relations with reference two arm posture .. Occup Envir With 2004; 61: 844-853.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not in these epidemiological studies to distinguish between rotator cuff syndrome and bursitis subachromiale
* Shoulder pain is generally due to tendinitis (75% and about 4 of 5 occur in the supraspinatus tendon), bursitis (15%) or frozen shoulder (10%). A combination of conditions is frequent &lt;ref&gt;Sluiter JK et al. Criteria document for of evaluating the work-relatedness of upper-extremity musculoskeletal disorders. Scand J Work Environ Health 2001; 27 Suppl 1: 1-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk Factors===
* There is evidence that the combination of strenuous and repetitive movements of the arms and work with arms raised above shoulder height leads to an increased risk of skuldertendinitis
* Typical business
o Slaughterhouse workers, heavier industrial assembly tasks. Building Painters, electricians, insulators, hairdressers and other industries where part of working going on with her arms raised above shoulder level
Clinic and diagnostics
* Reference is made to the sections on rotator cuff syndrome and chronic bursitis

===Causation===
* Symptoms of the disease are expected to act directly related to the period of execution of the shoulder-straining tasks. Epidemiological studies have shown that the greater the proportion of the day when you work with arms lifted, the greater the risk of developing skuldertendinitis. The exact limit for this is not known, but the case is recognized as work-related if the proportion is half of the working day or more. Studies of blood flow in supraspinatusmusklen which compromised by various degrees of elevation, supports the findings of the epidemiological studies
* Significantly strenuous and repetitive work are also shown to be a risk factor. Again it is known the exact duration
* Competing risk factors: Sports (tennis, swimming, handball). Former shoulder trauma. Anatomical relationship is deemed to be important, for example. a curved akromion or osteophytes
Vocational guidance and prevention
* 50% of patients with shoulder problems in general practice still have problems after 6 months and 40% after 12 months2
* If the patient's work involves the risk factors mentioned above, it must be determined how the patient can avoid these. It may be necessary relocation, if necessary. rehabilitation. On the whole, it will be the patient's functional that determines whether the patient can continue normal work
* The extent of the known shoulder stressors should preferably be reduced, which can be achieved for example. by job rotation, to avoid chord work and the use of assistive

===Review===
* Changes in the shoulder rotator tendons (rotator cuff syndrome / skuldertendinitis, tendinitis musculi articulatio humeri / impingementsyndrom) is recognized as an occupational disease by repetitive and strenuous shoulder movements combined with an assessment of the position of the arm with the load
* Changes in the biceps (biceps tendinitis, tendinitis caput longum musculus bicipitis brachii) is recognized as a result of static lifting of the upper arm to about 60 degrees or more
* There must have been relevant shoulder-straining work every day for at least half of the working day (3-4 hours) and long time (monthly)
Other relevant articles
* Rotator cuff injury
* Bursitis, shoulder, chronic

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Diagnostics of work-related asthma==

===Definitions===
* Occupational Asthma and -rhinitis: Asthma and rhinitis, which occurs as a result of exposure to factors in the work environment
* Asthma aggravated by work / -rhinitis: increased symptoms of asthma / rhinitis by exposure at work in people who have the disease prior to release;
* Inflammatory asthma: A state with increased increased bronchial reactivity and asthma after exposure to high concentrations of respiratory irritants
* Occupational-related asthma / -rhinitis is a generic term for occupational asthma, inflammatory and aggravated by the work 

===Occurrence===
* Approximately 10% (9-15%) of asthma in adulthood is related to work. About half of this is occupational asthma, caused by exposure at work
* Occupational-related rhinitis is assumed to be 3 times more common than asthma. Work-related rhinitis is the risk of asthma increased
* Bakers, farmers and people who work with animals, enzymes, isocyanates and anhydrides have an increased risk of sensitization and development of occupational asthma / rhinitis. Overall, exposure to airborne protein and reactive chemicals increased risk of asthma
* Board of industrial Injuries receives about 300 notifications of allergic respiratory disease per year, about half recognized
* Strong exposure (accidents) for respiratory irritants such as chlorine or fire smoke can in rare cases cause inflammatory asthma. It is debatable whether repeated moderate exposure can induce mode
===Risk Factors===
* Exposure to high molecular weight proteins (plants, animals, enzymes)
* Low-molecular substances: latex, isocyanates, formaldehyde, acid anhydrides, certain metals
* Atopics and people with asthma in the family are at increased risk for allergic reactions to high molecular weight allergens
* Smokers appear to have an increased risk of asthma by exposure to low molecular weight substances
* High level of exposure leads to increased risk of allergies - the possibility of prevention!
===Clinic and diagnostics===
* Work-related asthma and rhinitis have the same appearance as the diseases in general, see the section on allergy
The disease occurs after exposure for weeks to months, if necessary. only after several years
* The relation to exposure at work can be immediately response and delayed response after 6-8 hours. Dual response - the presence of both reactions are common in IgE mediated asthma
* Study of atopy (total IgE) and allergy to standard respiratory sensitisers RAST, skin prick test
Study of specific allergies in relation to the work: RAST, skin prick test, histamine release (HR) test
* When exposed to low molecular weight chemicals detected specific allergy, in most cases
* Inflammatory asthma is probably due to direct damage to the mucosa and attack Outpouring of nonspecific irritation
* Possibly. provocation with the suspected allergen. emergency treatment required
* Peak flow monitoring at least 4 daily measurements during periods of work and leisure, for example. a week of each. Any sick leave, which means elimination
* Temporary interruption of medication considered for peak flow monitoring, testing for bronchial hyperreactivity, reversibilitetstest and provocation

===Causation===
* The criteria for occupational asthma / rhinitis (asthma caused by work) is a) debut after recruitment, b) appropriate temporal relation to work, c) exposure to a pathogenic topic at work
* Positive RAST or skin prick test detected most frequently by allergies to high molecular weight allergens, less often (about 30%) with low molecular weight substances
* Occupational aggravated disease assessed from a) disease history , b) the relationship of symptoms to exposure at work and c) identifying relevant hazardous exposures in the workplace including allergens, irritants, cold and exertion
===Differential diagnoses===
* include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with asthmatic component, allergic alveolitis, hyper-responsive airways, nonspecific cough
* Competing interpretations is currently at the occurrence of the same allergen in private and working life and uncertain diagnosis
===Follow-up===
* In allergic asthma patient is removed from the operative exposure. The longer exposure time, the greater the risk of permanent asthma results. 
* For non-allergic asthma may reorganizing the work environment is attempted with close assessment of whether measures reverses disease progression
===Prevention===
* Primary prevention by elimination or reduction of exposure including occasional peak exposures
* Vocational guidance to young people with asthma and atopy
* Secondary prevention with the monitoring of employees is practiced in some high-risk business
===Review===
* Upon reasonable suspicion erhversrelateret asthma notification shall be made to the Labour Inspection and Injuries via the EASY system. If work-related asthma verified or disproved sent additional information, regardless of prior review
* Is causation unsure refer to the Occupational Medicine Department, allergist or pulmonary diseases

===Information for the patient===
* Information about allergens and irritants, most likely the cause of the symptoms, to be reorganized from work and at home
* Both occupational and private exposure (cat, dog, dust mites, mold) is assessed and if necessary. counteracted by allergy redevelopment
* Smoking can be a problem in both places
* Advice in relation to possible. workers' compensation
* Written patient information is available on the Danish arbejdsmedicineres online information Armoni

      <text xml:space="preserve">Stress (adjustment disorder, stress disorder), work-related

===Definition===
By adjustment disorder is defined as a clinical condition that
Occurs in connection to severe or prolonged psychosocial stress
Is characterized by anxiety, aversion and the experience of loss of self-control
It is assumed that the non-specific symptoms do not occur in the context of depression, anxiety disorder, functional illness, substance abuse, personality disorder or physical illness
Differentiation from normal psychological reactions to life and work are blurred and depends primarily on the duration of symptoms (weeks / months) and consistency (incapacity)
Stress disorder is used to describe a long-term mental disorder (up to 2 years)
Stress disorders are transient states, although they may be lengthy. If no improvement is seen, the diagnosis should be reconsidered
Burn-out syndrome perceived as a stress condition caused by long-term, frequent and intense emotional impact and social interactions in working with people with help, care and service is central. Once the syndrome has developed, it is characterized by emotional exhaustion, emotional distancing and reduced personal performance. The relationship between particular exposures in the workplace and this condition are poorly documented. There are many kasusistiske and theoretical studies, but no controlled studies in part due to diagnosis regard to its cause. Sweden has defined a fatigue syndrome regardless of the cause and found no evidence of correlation with psychosocial work conditions such as high demands and low decision http://www.sbu.se/upload/Publikationer/Content0/1/arbetsmiljo_depression/Arbetsmiljo_depression_fulltext.pdf

===Occurrence===

Over the past 10-15 years have seen a gradual increase in the number of work-related mental health problems that are reported to the National Board. In 2013 was supposed stress-related conditions about 25% of all reported work-related illnesses
The reasons are not known. We do not know if there is a real increase in the incidence of work-related psychological difficulties or increased focus and interest in the media and among different actors contribute to uncovering previously hidden problems or 'relabeling' of conditions previously went by a different name
The notified work-related mental health problems are a heterogeneous group of conditions, but most can probably best be classified as diagnostic adaptation or stress disorders
Stress disorders are common in primary care and is associated with high sickness absence but details of incidence in the population and the proportion that have their roots in working conditions, lack of

===Risk Factors===

There is no international consensus on the definition and operationalization of psychosocial conditions in the workplace and beyond. Stress Theories based on job strain and effort-reward Imbalance models have gained much ground in research, but have only limited application in clinical practice
A pragmatic and simple but undocumented classification based on the experience of the Danish occupational medical practice operates with three main types of work-related problems that can result in stress disorder, or perhaps in the most severe cases depressive disorder
Events that can be ratified in time and place (accidents causing death or mutilation, violence, verbal threats, humiliation in the presence of others, repeated serious reprimands, unwanted sexual advances, demotion, disregarding, unwanted transfer or termination, critical media exposure). Employees of the prison service, police, defense and social care sector are like drivers and emergency workers particularly vulnerable to some of these issues, while others occur in any industry
Claims quantitatively and / or qualitatively exceeds the personal resources and / or skills. The key is the scope of work (too many tasks) or character (tasks that can not be resolved). The imbalance between demands and resources may be due to mismanagement, lack or unrealistic planning, own requirements and expectations. These conditions typically occur in connection with executive functions, organizational changes and projects with deadlines
Conflicts with interpersonal tension and emotional stress. The key is uncomfortable conversations, open hand, personal likes and dislikes and protracted emotionally challenging conflicts, whereas the tasks in itself is not the source of the problems. Long-term cooperation conflicts can be stressful for both employee satisfaction and productivity and are often accompanied by high absenteeism, which further compromises the work environment

===Clinic and diagnostics===
The condition develops gradually over weeks to months but may by sudden severe psycho-trauma occur faster
The symptoms are nonspecific and include sadness, sleep disturbance, crying, feeling prohibitive care, poor self-esteem, fatigue, irritability, forgetfulness and difficulty concentrating
Often, a specific event like a daunting workload or an unpleasant confrontation to mental breakdown with crying and sick leave
There are no diagnostic paraclinical tests. Stress hormones, cardiovascular markers and blood pressure can not be used in clinical practice
Psychological testing of cognitive function and personality tests and tests for depressive disorder may be helpful differential diagnostic
The process can be long lasting (months / years), but are in most cases self-limiting. If the condition does not improve within one year's time, the other diagnosis considered
    
===Causation===

Evaluation of the causal relationship between psychosocial trauma and clinical condition based on history, possibly supplemented by information from work colleagues and / or relatives
Are the psychological reactions in a reasonable onset plausible relation to the nature and intensity of the effects or situations the patient has been in? It's a judgment call, the result of more based on 
===Consensus than on research evidence===
Cause assessment is complicated by the considerable variation in personal vulnerability or resilience. One factor that increases the vulnerability is neuroticism
If, prior to the mode's start is an unremarkable work and private life without depression, anxiety or alcohol abuse or current problems in the private sphere, causing diagnosis and causality assessment rarely difficulties

===Workers' Compensation===

Stress disorders are not covered by occupational list and will usually not be recognized under workers' compensation law

===Vocational guidance and prevention===

It is crucial to support the patient in structuring and solving the problems that led up to the state
It should earliest possible clarified whether to rely on the same or another workplace. Assessment of this issue is important to shorten the further process and reduce the risk of transition to long-term absence and in the worst case loss of associated labor
It speaks for maintaining current employment, to a shift in itself is an extra burden in a situation where self-esteem is reduced. This is often possible in situations dominated by congestion where the problems can be addressed by appropriate organizational or resource initiatives
At harassment and workplace conflict, changing jobs can be the best option
Some studies show that supportive cognitive therapy has a beneficial effect on the course. This includes training in practical problem solving related to the specific work. Offers of this nature can be found at some of Occupational Medicine</text>

Write a function that moves the linkbot forward and turns right 90 degrees.  Call it four times to have the linkbot draw a square!

== Idea for inclusion of Linkbot ==
Write a program that plays a tone with frequency x, then changes x= x-x*2**(1/12) [which should move a chromatic note lower, I think].  Call it 12 times to play a chromatic scale?  Combine with input to change what note/octave it starts on?

I like this idea because it kind of fits w/ the whole theme of recursive functions, which is the main topic of this chapter. -[[User:Davidko barobo|Davidko barobo]] ([[User talk:Davidko barobo|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Davidko barobo|contribs]]) 22:31, 15 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

&lt;!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
This is a test page for CIS133DA. I'll be using the various tools on this page to edit the text. This page gives you a lot of the same text editing tools that most word processors due, including '''bold''', ''italic'', &lt;u&gt;underline&lt;/u&gt;, and &lt;s&gt;strikeout&lt;/s&gt;. When editing this page you can double click to highlight single words or click and drag to highlight strings of text to select what you want to edit and click on the editing tool you wish to use. You can also click the button first and it will have a space for you to type the text into. For example, if you click the strikeout button without text you see the following: &lt;s&gt;text&lt;/s&gt;.

Aside from editing text, you can also provide links to other sites/pages like so: [https://google.com To search on google]. You just need to click on the link button on the toolbar and it prompts you to add the URL address and asks what text you would like to show up on the link. You can do the same with media files.

If you expand the Advanced options you can further format the page with headings, text size, lists, text type, and a few other handy options:
== Heading Level 2 ==
&lt;tt&gt;teletype text type&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
Sample text for Bash text type
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

You can also use various tags to reference media, books, pages from books, etc.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Passive, but radical environmentalism is probably the wisest way for those who are poor and do not have an environmentalism-related profession. Here're some one-liner ideas for passive environmentalism, or in other words, ideas about what we should not do, in order to protect the environment better (summary of other parts of this book is also included):

* Those who are poorer than the average should not beget more than two children.
* Those who want to reduce carbon emissions should probably not eat meat on Mondays or Saturdays, for example.
* Environmentalists should not waste electricity and gas, so keep away from TV and gas stoves, for example.
* Environmentalists should not publish technological research too harmful to the environment.
* Environmentalists should not vote for parties too harmful to the environment.
* Environmentalists should not buy products or services too harmful to the environment.
* Environmentalists should not borrow money if it is not really needed.
* Deodorant sprays and similar materials are only worth using when needed, it is not worth smoking, etc.
* There is an idea to put our waste in the packaging material of what we have bought.

These could be appended by more later, or explained in more detail.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Business ideas in IT sector (computer programming) ==

=== Creating better software for file/fileset compression ===
File/fileset compression is much more efficient today than it was, say, ten years ago. Technology like 7zip, PAQ or the WebP image compression method beat the old technology, but they are probably still not the best. With better compression technology, it is possible to use less hardware storage for the same tasks (but note that it is also possible to use more processing power for them). It is also possible to use slow compression in order to make decompression quicker, which would probably be good for software package formats like CAB. This means that different kinds of compression methods fit for different purposes, and one of these purposes is to lessen hardware needs (and another is to keep the information more secure from hardware errors at the same time). This way, for example, one DVD would be enough for a software installer that would otherwise need two DVDs, or a Linux distribution could put its complete source code together with its executables on less CDs. If we worked hard on compression technology, it might also be possible to have fun with mathematics and win the Hutter Prize. Drawback: even if we invent a great compression technology, it is not guaranteed at all that someone will use it on optical drives, and &quot;data easily fills the available space&quot; on other drives, as well as the property of the rich.

=== Creating better audio/video/image file formats/codecs/players ===
Optical (CD/DVD) disks are mostly used for music, video and images. If the contents of these disks could be compressed significantly better, some CD/DVD sets would need less disks, reducing the consumption that harms the environment. If the decompression does not need too much more processing power, it is probably good to work on things like this, and maybe in the other case as well. When designing file formats for music/video, it is important to define first what information should these file formats contain (e.g. pixel images by a given FPS - frames per second - value is the easiest), and coding this information in a practical/lossless/compressed manner would be a nice mathematical task. Drawback: musicians tend to release only a few songs at a time fit on one CD, and most of the movies fit on one DVD, and even if they do not, Blu-Ray disks have appeared on the market. (However, similar technology could help saving the quality of the data written on CD/DVD, by properly placed redundancy, and more independence between parts of data. Actually, this might interest people more than compression.)

=== Creating a proper website for local barter ===
(Internet-only idea...) There are already websites which allow successful local barter, but in fact, these websites were not designed for this purpose. On websites for local classifieds it is not local barter which dominates, and the people willing to swap rarely have things which are mutually interesting, and on a book-swapping website it is impossible to limit the receivers to only local people, and thus the swapping is probably not economical due to the postage fees. However, if we joined the advantages of both kind of websites, then it would be worth capitalizing on this opportunity for much more people. In order to increase the range of exchange, it would be worth using virtual credits on the website, and the users could decide how much virtual credits do they ask for their stuff. These virtual credits could be spent on the purchase of the things on the site, but the website would deduct some percent from it for the costs of maintenance and other causes, from which the owners of the website could equally buy some used things on the site, or even sell them in a shop. This way this local exchange website would work in a similar way as the now-popular local money, with the difference that virtual credits should not be converted to/from real money for marketing reasons. For reusing stuff, the exchange of used things can have a relatively high environmentalist value. Drawback: the implementation of this might need significant financial resources.

=== Increasing communication for efficiency ===
(Internet-only idea...) Computers and the Internet help making the communication among people more effective, and this communication may make the protection of the environment more effective. For example, communication may help people decide what events should happen, and these different events should happen where the demand is the greatest for them. This way more people can disengage with the same use of energy, which also means that less energy is needed for the disengagement of the same number of people. This could be implemented by a software for voting, and this software would be available both from mobile devices and on the Internet. For example, people could vote about what movies they would like to watch in a cinema for old movies, what performances they would like to watch in a theatre, where should the next concerts of a band take place, what books should have movie versions, etc. There are also cases when it is good for the people if other people do not choose the same opportunities as themselves, for example, if they want to spend their holidays on a place where there won't be a great multitude of people, or if they would like to work at a place, and do a job for which there is not much competition. The duty of the software would be to utilize the power of communication at the decision making in more and more similar cases. Drawback: the implementation of this might need significant financial resources.</text>

&lt;!-- Usage extracted from {{TOL}} when made the broken template a redirect to here

---&gt;

;Purpose and usage
:This template forms correct addressing for a plain link construction hyperlinking a Wikibook word or phrase to the TrainzOnline wiki (operated by {{Wp|N3V Games Pty., Ltd}}) covering the technical topic. Its use also automatically includes auto-categorization to the [[Trainz/Project]]s administrative tracking [[:Category: Trainz reference pages]] with &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; '| {{SUBPAGENAME}}' &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; pipe-tricking. 
&lt;br&gt;
;usage
This template forms a link between the [[Trainz|Trainz Wikibook]] and a ''''TrainzOnline'''' reference page on the {{wp|N3V Games}} Mediawiki based 'TrainzOnline Wiki' web site using: &lt;code&gt;http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/&lt;/code&gt; as a prefix for the default url or equivalent&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter.
* This template is used extensively in the [[Trainz]] Wikibook.
{{TRS-warning|'''Warning:''' Accessing links with certain punctuation characters will break the link parsing. If a formed url truncates, the next character needs a {{wp|Unicode|UNICODE}} escape character. The Prime case in linking N3V's TrainzOnline Wiki is pages containing the double-quote in the title such as &lt;code&gt; &quot;Trainz-build&quot; tag' &lt;/code&gt; which can be coded as %22 for the quotes so using &lt;code&gt; %22Trainz-build%22 tag' &lt;/code&gt; will work.
* '''Moral''', when capturing a link from your browser's address bar, use {{kp|CTRL|A}} to force a full base url, then {{kp|CTRL|C}} to capture the Unicoded internationally acceptable url. Past the url, then truncate from the http: to the slash before the page title '''as the input to {{Tl|N3V}}'''. Use of the truncated part like the example given above will keep the page text orderly, and removing the underscores with successive copy and paste will form a prettyprint hyperlinked output string.
* Alternatively, the full url may be passed to template {{tl|plain link}} another more general tool in the [[:category:link templates|external linking templates]] similar to this one to produce viable correct links.
*'''ALL EXTERNAL LINKS should be tested before finalizing your edits! Use of a browser which does not preserve your previewed edit and enable you to back track to finish like Internet Explorer is counter-productive.
}}
* Multi-word article's titles may not contain a space, but must instead use an underscore.
* Section titles are permissible as well, following an '#' operator, but again the string MAY NOT contain whitespace characters.
 &lt;big&gt;'''Bottom Line: Use Underscore characters '_' instead  of spaces or tabs.''&lt;/big&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
: '''Example-1:''' &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TOL | category-class }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; creates the link: &lt;!--

---&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/category-class category-class]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;!--

---&gt;
* A pretty-print ({{plain link|http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Help:Piped_link#Pipe_trick|pipetrick}}) can be given as the second default &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter.&lt;!--

---&gt;
: '''Example-2:''' the format: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TOL | {{{1}}} | {{{2}}} }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; with the parameters defined:  &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TOL | KIND TrainzBaseSpec | Kinds list }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will form the link: &lt;!--

An atom is the basic unit that makes up all matter.  

yuarnzii shih yiqieh wuhzhih de jibeen danweih.  


There are many different types of atoms, each with its own name, mass and size.  

yuarnzii yoou heen duo zhoong, geh yoou mirngcheng, zhihliahng her dahxiaao.  


These different types of atoms are called chemical elements.  

zhehxie bu torng de yuarnzii jiaohzuoh huahxuer yuarnsuh.  


The chemical elements are organized on the periodic table, such as hydrogen and gold.  

huahxuer yuarnsuh biaao liehchu geh geh huahxuer yuarnsuh, rur qingqih her jin.  


Atoms are very small, but the exact size changes depending on the element.  

yuarnzii heen xiaao, err meei geh yuarnzii de dahxiaao dou bu yiyahng.  


Atoms range from 0.1 to 0.5 nanometers in width.  

yuarzii de kuanduh 0.1 zhih 0.5 nanometer.  


One nanometer is around 100,000 times smaller than the width of a human hair.  

1 nanometer dahyue shih 10,0000 fenzhi 1 tiaor tourfah de kuanduh.  


This makes atoms impossible to see without special tools.  

meiryoou tehshu shehbeih bu keenerng kahndaoh yuarnzii.  


Equations must be used to see the way they work and how they interact with other atoms.

yuarnzii yuu qirta yuarnzii de huahxuer faanyihng yaoh yohng fangcherngshih biaaoshih.

But some do. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A previous employee of Google advised how he lived on the campus of the agency in Mountain View, California, for 54 weeks amongst 2005 and 2006.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matthew Weaver advised the BBC that a person had challenged him to devote a 12 months in a trailer parked in the spot of the firm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He extra that, despite the fact that believed to be the initial to do so, other personnel adopted later. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I was not likely to the&quot; sleeping pods &quot;(sleeping capsules). They had and have plenty of hype ... but for me it was as loud as sleeping at the desk &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ben Discoe &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two Google and other major engineering organizations are identified to offer you further benefits to their personnel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;There ended up three meals a day in the cafeteria and showers at the health club, also on campus, so I showered at the gymnasium and take in in the office,&quot; he recalled. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;There was a free laundry on campus, and there I washed my clothing.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google campuses are identified for providing entertainment chances in the place of work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;There had been all sorts of rooms with pianos, foosball tables, and this sort of factors, so I experienced ample to do right after operate.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;And we experienced areas in the parking whole lot where I could perform on my bicycle.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Stability did not care&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;In direction of the conclude of the fifty four weeks and in the course of the two or three years afterwards folks came to question me questions&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matthew Weaver, previous staff of Google &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The former staff, who labored beneath the enigmatic title &quot;workers ecologist site,&quot; defined that fairly than hide their presence made it extremely obvious. For a while I set synthetic grass and a picket fence around his motor vehicle. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Safety still didnât care,&quot; he additional. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;This was in 2005 when Google was a significantly scaled-down and far more united business.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;As soon as protection realized it was me, it was protected and basically they watched the site.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaver believed to be the very first prolonged-expression settled on campus. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I'm pretty sure I was the first. Towards the end of the fifty four months and for the duration of the two or 3 several years afterwards men and women came to ask me inquiries. &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;They stated anything like, 'I'm pondering about living on campus, do you have any advice?'&quot;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaver explained he was comfy with that lifestyle but eventually moved simply because the problem had become &quot;anything weird&quot; to describe the girls I dated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;A hidden&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The abnormal home Weaver gained prominence right after I hung some comments about his daily life on the campus of Google in an on the web forum. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other former employees of the very same business also shared his encounter on how is to dwell on campus. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His stay was shorter but a lot more latest. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I labored a whole lot, so never ever bored ... I loved it.  &quot;I would really like to do it againâ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brandon Oxendine &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brandon Oxendine, who aided layout the way how Google profiles work, explained that when he lived on campus in between June and September 2012, experienced to do it secretly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;A friend who experienced been in 5 or 6 a long time Google told me there is some thing in the guide that states the business is not allowed to be on campus more than 72 several hours, or something,&quot; he explained. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oxendine slept on a mattress he stored in a truck in the garage below the developing exactly where he labored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I told absolutely everyone that he experienced moved to San Francisco, but was always sporting the identical clothes&quot; he recalled. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Ben Discoe in Google individuals ridiculed a tiny the &quot;capsules for slumber.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like his predecessor, said there was by no means need for starving. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I consider there is a type of plan that Google has that no staff ought to be far from a location to drink.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I worked a good deal, so I was never bored ... I cherished it,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Document sixty months &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the person who probably retains the report of highest on campus is Ben Discoe, which was dependent on his van parked for much more than sixty months in the course of 2011 and 2012. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discoe also lived in a van but &quot;cheated&quot; considering that he had a girlfriend with a department. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;But I did cheat a minor,&quot; he admits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I experienced a girlfriend who had an condominium in Mountain Look at, so I went there sometimes.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discoe recollects that when he started out functioning at Google was a collaborative inside webpage named &quot;Living on Google,&quot; which had been produced by another worker. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It outlined several other rewards to be experienced, like free of charge washing machines and so and so,&quot; he informed the BBC. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The only thing not gave to us was shampoo. He explained, 'Maybe you get shampoo if your shares achieve the $ 300'. And then it was crossed out and say '$ 400' and that was crossed out and say '$ five hundred.' &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I think now the equal is about $ one,two hundred, and even now no shampoo.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google encourages its staff not to stay in the workplace, but is not actively combating from it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Discoe included that Google provides its very own resting places for the staff, but they are impractical to sleep. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I was not heading to the&quot; sleeping pods &quot;(sleeping capsules). They had and have a good deal of hoopla ... but for me it was as loud as sleeping at the desk. &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;And they have been ridiculed a little bit.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google declined to remark. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BBC understands that the company encourages its personnel not to stay in the workplace, but is not actively fighting against it.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Published by:  IwayMagazine &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.viadaseditorial.com&quot;&gt;curso revit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hundreds of young children in the United States ended up hospitalized with serious respiratory ailment. Scientists say they believe that an animal is guilty of Enterovirus D68, also known as EV-D68. curso revit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enteroviruses are frequent, specially in September, but this specific guy is not. They had been less than one hundred cases since it was discovered in the 1960s, according to the Centers for Disease Management and Prevention of Diseases in the United States (CDC, for its acronym in English). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lee: A respiratory virus influencing hundreds of children in the United States &lt;br /&gt;Listed here is what you want to know about the issue: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What are the signs and symptoms? &lt;br /&gt;The virus typically commences like the widespread cold symptoms incorporate sneezing, runny nose and cough. This is what occurs to most folks who get an enterovirus. &lt;br /&gt;But some sufferers will have a severe cough, issues respiratory and / or create a rash. The EV-D68 is also often accompanied by fever or wheezing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when you need to start worrying? &lt;br /&gt;However it is difficult at very first but it is unattainable to distinguish between a normal chilly and this type of virus. But there are indicators that you should care if your little one gets unwell. &lt;br /&gt;Go to the doctor if you produce a fever or rash, or if your kid has difficulties respiration. Children with a background of asthma or respiratory issues are specifically inclined to severe signs and symptoms. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How is EV-D68? &lt;br /&gt;There is no particular remedy for enterovirus, in accordance to the CDC. Loads of rest, fluids and non-prescription medicines will help relieve signs in standard circumstances. &lt;br /&gt;Patients who are hospitalized are likely to receive help breathing and what is named &quot;supportive therapy&quot; to support your immune system to battle an infection. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The place is spreading the virus? &lt;br /&gt;Twelve states in the United States are investigating enterovirus illness groups: Alabama, Colorado, Michigan, Georgia, Ohio, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Kentucky and Utah. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the EV-D68 is typically tough to distinguish from related so the virus could also be in other states. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why are youngsters hospitalized? &lt;br /&gt;Anyone can enterovirus, in accordance to the CDC, but kids, infants and adolescents are more likely to get sick simply because you do not build immunity from previous exposures to viruses. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How do I defend the young children? &lt;br /&gt;Respiratory illness is unfold by way of near make contact with, like the typical chilly. You can also get it by touching objects or surfaces that have the virus, and then touching your face. &lt;br /&gt;Not a lot you can do, say health officials, outside of using typical perception actions to minimize threat. &lt;br /&gt;Clean your arms with soap and water for twenty seconds specifically soon after utilizing the rest room and altering diapers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleanse and disinfect surfaces that are generally performed by diverse people, these kinds of as toys and knobs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Evita waves her fingers, kissing, hugging and sharing cups or utensils with individuals who are ill.

=Setting the Scene=



Be it at the office, building site, or car yard, all working men relate to the ease of grabbing your lunch ‘grab your lunch and go’ during busy times. Being realistic, your long-term health isn't exactly a priority when e-mails are to be sent, phone calls are to be made, and deals  negotiated.

===Are takeaway foods healthy options?===

[[File:Double cheese cheeseburger (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|200px|Commercial burgers are typical takeaway foods high in fat, salt, and refined carbohydrate]]

Remembering that while these foods are tasty, affordable, and most importantly, ‘time-savers’,  they are high in nutrients our bodies don’t need large amounts of, like sugars, salt, saturated fats, and refined carbohydrates. These nutrients should be moderated throughout our day, as in large amounts over many weeks, months and years, they can cause us long-term health problems such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and obesity &lt;ref name=&quot;(NHMRC, 2013).&quot;&gt;National Health and Medical Research Council, 2013. Australian Dietary Guidelines. Retrieved 21/10/2013 from: http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines/publications/n55.&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Adding nutrition to takeaway foods===

While is it very difficult to find takeaway foods that aren’t filled with the nutrients we don’t need so much of, knowing some quick and simple ways to add extra nutrition into them can be a very handy skill. Many studies have shown that vegetables offer adult men many nutritional and lifestyle benefits, so it is important that you includes vegetables where possible, so you can benefit from these. 



=Why eat more vegetables?=

[[File:Chess players from IsraeDSCN5383.JPG|thumb|150px|Just 1 serve of vegetables can help give you energy to sustain concentration]]
The vitamins and minerals found in the vegetables you eat can help your body produce energy, and the fibre content can help you feel full for longer. These benefits mean you are less likely to grab a chocolate bar or pastry, for example, to give you that 3pm energy boost. Vegetables therefore give you proper nutrition to enable you to concentrate on the important tasks at work, get through the day without feeling sluggish, and prevent you from falling ill.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; &quot;&lt;u&gt;Main Health Benefits of Vegetables&lt;/u&gt;

| '''B vitamins'''||Important for creating energy from the foods we eat
|-
| '''Magnesium'''||Immune function 
|-
| '''Zinc'''||Immune function, improved mood, and sexual health 
|-
| '''Vitamins, A, E &amp; K'''||Antioxidants for heart and vascular health
|}



==What is a Serve of Vegetables?==

[[File:West Show Jersey July 2010 17.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Fresh vegetables in a range of types and colours may offer a range of benefits]].
'''One serve of vegetables is equivalent to:'''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| 1 cup or 75g salad vegetables
|-
| 1/2 cup of cooked vegetables or legumes
|-
| 1 medium potato (deep fried potato chips excluded
|}




===How Many Serves Are Recommended?===
Five and a half serves of vegetables are required for an Australian middle-aged man every day, in order to maintain good health &lt;ref name=&quot;(NHMRC, 2013).&quot;&gt;National Health and Medical Research Council, 2013. Australian Dietary Guidelines. Retrieved 21/10/2013 from: http://www.nhmrc.gov.au/guidelines/publications/n55.&lt;/ref&gt;, so aiming to eat 1 serve while at work is achievable.

Vegetables can provide:
* Weight loss
* Reduced blood pressure &amp; cholesterol levels
* Anti-cancer effects
* Regularity with high amounts of dietary fibre
* Improved concentration and productivity with a range of vitamins &amp; minerals&lt;ref name=&quot;(NHMRC, 2013).&quot;&gt;National Health and Medical Research Council, 2013.

Perhaps it should be organized by whether it is traditionally a vegan food or a substitution. Hmm...</text>

=Surveyor Hotkeys=
The KEY to operating most tools is to understand how and when {{kp| - }}, {{kp| +}}, {{kp| [ }}, {{kp| ] }} affect the active tool tip on the one hand, and when a secondary hotkey selects a class of asset on the other. The Primary hotkeys {{kp|F1, F2, ... , F7}} select the {{mb|active tool tab}}, which when pressed will toggle the tab and tool panels open or closed, as do mouseclicks as indicated.
 
A selected tool in the tool panel is often still active, so a key sequence selecting the {{mb|4th TAB-Tracks and Trackside}} such as {{kb|F4}}, then {{kp|''T''|'''M'''|F4}} will activate the ''''Trackside Tools TAB' ([F4])''', the 'T' for {{mb|'''T'''racks}} ''sub-tool menu'' and then the ''''M'''' for {{mb|Move Vertex tool}}, which will allow you to drag track vertex elements around. The last {{Kp|F4}} closes the tool panel and lets the user have more screen while adjusting Tracks. The {{mb|4th TAB-Tracks and Trackside}} mouse button can instead be used to toggle the active tool menu open and closed.

In reality, a practiced route builder will likely be toggling back and forth between several tool panels and their respective active tool sub-menus and active tools while doing fine detailing of a section of map, say where a road ({{TG|spline|spline object}} {{kp|F3|S}}) runs beside a small stream (another spline asset) both of which parallel the tracks for a time, then the stream crosses under the tracks and perhaps so does the road&amp;mdash; all running mostly together. That main scenery runs along side farmer's fields (fences being another spline, and crops often another; while farm equipment, vehicles, and animals are Objects, a different sub-menu); and down the street a few thousand meters&amp;mdash;a row of rural housing ('''O'''bjects, using {{kp|F3| '''O''' }}) which need individual placement ({{kp|LMB}} and a likely adjustment of '''H'''eight, '''R'''otation, and ''a '''M'''ove or two'' of it's position, for each and every one, (not to mention their yard elements such as trees, swings, sidewalks, driveways, hedges and so forth). Creation of even a small detailed area becomes a marathon of intense concentration and takes a practiced eye and fore-planning. 

A common enough circumstance, but integrating the Trainz assets with their respective heights, shaping the landscaping as you go means the route builder will be using a veritable flurry of hotkeys and mouse operations, perhaps switching tools as often as once every three-to-five seconds! TS12 is notorious for being responsible for slowing down that process, as the game can't keep up with the mind and hands of a practiced artist at their trade. Instead, with TS12, one often has to wait while the tool switch gets each tool to be reloaded into what seems to be the same patch of memory&amp;mdash;a sloppy programmer assumption and bad effect for the Trainz Power user.

==GS actions==
Hello Neil. I cleaned up recent changes a bit today, there were lots of spammers in action. I saw fit to operate, despite the fact that there are enough sysops active. I shouldn't have done that perhaps. Could you let me know if GSs are welcome here? Or maybe, do you prefer to delete/block spams by yourselves? Thanks! &lt;small&gt;(Good luck for your election)&lt;/small&gt; ;) --[[User:Frigotoni|&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Bradley Hand ITC; color:black&quot; &gt;'''Frigotoni'''&lt;/span&gt;]][[:meta:User_talk:Frigotoni|&lt;small&gt; ...&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:Segoe Script; color:navy&quot; &gt;'''i'm here'''&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;]]; 13:06, 3 February 2013 (UTC)
:Hello there. Global sysops are welcome to block and delete obvious spam and vandalism here.

== Re:Wikivoyage ==

Thanks very much for updating the template. I think the links may have some relevance here, especially from books about cities and countries. After things quieten down on Wikivoyage, we will have a discussion about possible collaboration with sister sites, and I think it may be worth linking to Wikibooks' language guides for travellers to practice before going overseas. I'm sure the future is exciting for both projects! Thanks again, [[User:JamesA|JamesA]] ([[User talk:JamesA|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesA|contribs]]) 05:06, 8 February 2013 (UTC)

== Deleting of Wikibook ==

I am new to Wikibooks.  I had to create a Wikibooks for a University of Florida nutrition course assignment.  This had to be graded first, then would be ultimately submitted to Wikibooks.  Apparently, I typed the &quot;wrong&quot; comment in my description box, because my page was deleted by you before I could explain this.  I put hours of work into my page and feel it was very rude of you to delete my hard work without allowing me to explain myself adequately.

This project has a deadline, which now, I may not be able to meet due to the deletion of my work.  Please explain who makes these decisions without giving the submitter a chance to give proper explanation first?

I feel this action was completely inexcusable.

::The community makes the rules, the administrators apply them. In this case there is a rule that Wikibooks is not to be used to host personal material and it can be deleted without discussion. Ergo I deleted it. If you are now saying it is intended to form part of a book, then it can be undeleted. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 08:23, 24 March 2013 (UTC)
::: In those grounds I disagree with the deletion (did you really deleted because of it ? or did you simply intended to pass another point ?). It had merit on the simple comment Lcareynolds provided (and he indicates it, and so by default his definition of &quot;inexcusable&quot; had no ground).
::: The comment seemed to indicate an unwillingness to license the work to Wikibooks, something that was automatic by the fact it was posted.
::: Then there is a valid issue of up to what point does the user own his creative work done for the University of Florida (it seems to depend from institution to institution). 
::: Now personal space by definition makes anything on a personal space... well... personal material... (So please do not delete personal user space items on those grounds. Spam, offensive material and nonsense can be quickly delete but the rest may require a bit more work, even detailed personal info, about self, may require a quick deletion but will also force a request if the intention was to make it public).
::: Lcareynolds, you are new here but you could exert a bit more diplomacy, especially due to that fact. The page deletion only lasted for ~2hours there is no need exacerbate the issue, unless anyone opposed the restoration...
::: There was a dialog some time ago about restricting the use of the main userpage. I do not remember anyone opposing that view but there are however other users making use of it for other purposes.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 08:55, 24 March 2013 (UTC)
::::I read the edit summary to be an explicit statement that the content was not intended to be part of Wikibooks (which is why I reviewed in the first place) and when I read the content it looked very much like someone using Wikibooks to hold their personal homework. Most administrators (and not just on Wikibooks) delete this content as falling foul of the &quot;not a web host&quot; criterion. As you probably know Wikibooks is only lightly administered which is why we have a lot of inappropriate content in the user space, including copyright violations which remain awaiting administration for months. Therefor if I spot something I will typically deal with it immediately rather than leave it and risk it becoming a long term or bigger problem. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:43, 24 March 2013 (UTC)
::::: I continue to see an issue with your interpretation of «falling foul of the &quot;not a web host&quot; criterion» on userspace, in regards to other type of content beyond the exceptions we have on the deletion policy and have agreed upon (I think I covered those exceptions above, even dealing with private information has lead to mistakes). ::::: I'm not disagreeing with the need to provide stronger guidelines to the main user space or even stating that your view point is not practical to avoid abuse in consideration to the points you raise. Any experienced Wikibookian will not see a deletion as unredeemed action but it can alienate new users or even due to the personal implementation you are fallowing lead to loss o otherwise reusable content. Looking at the content on this deletion at direct examination without the other issues, that I agree justified the action, the content had some reusable value (has as the user will utilize it as soon as it gets &quot;validation&quot;).
::::: I had seen the initial post of this thread and found the sense of offense expressed to be exaggerated but only felt a need to interject due to the fact that I don't think we can apply &quot;not a web host&quot; with any consistency on the userspace. Part of my own userspace (and many other Wikibookians) could be deleted depending on how the acting administrator classified it, as I said personal space will consist in personal content there is no way to bypass that.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 10:42, 24 March 2013 (UTC)

::::: The more permissive we are within our rules about content the more attractive the project becomes to a vaster group of people, even contrarians. Even deletion of content from talk pages that one classifies as not important to the development of the book may be problematic especially if it relates to the subject (not opposing it just to demonstrate the correlation, since we are on your talk page). Personal decisions are at times necessary but should the exception as they otherwise tend to do more harm than good (this is valid to many other topics, like the repeated discussions regarding reviewers).
::::: I would again extend my support for at least a guideline establishing the proper use of the main user page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 10:48, 24 March 2013 (UTC) (It seems we already have a [[Wikibooks:User pages|draft]] going on that front.) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 10:54, 24 March 2013 (UTC)

{{outdent|::::}}
There are only two issues here, neither of which warrants a lot of controversy.

First, this was a quite straightforwardly justified deletion.  Webhosting.  There is no ambiguous situation here that requires additional bureaucratic rules to cover it; webhosting is not allowed.  The edit summary explicitly (though misleadingly, but that's the second issue) said it wasn't material meant to be released on Wikibooks.

Second, it appears that the edit summary was misworded, the intent being to say that it ''would'' be used on Wikibooks.  If admins weren't stretched so horribly thinly around here, it would have been perfectly reasonable to leave a note of inquiry on the user's talk page and give them some time to respond.  I'd oppose red tape requiring such; it's counter-productive to choose competent admins and then fetter them.  But the reason that didn't happen here was that it seemed straightforward ''and we don't have tools to help keep track of such cases''.  It's worth taking a moment to contemplate what sort of general tool would make it easier to deal with such cases &amp;mdash; keeping in mind that any tool implies some sort of extra work somewhere to use and maintain the tool, so it should be terrifically easy-and-natural to use and save a significant amount of work in order to be a net improvement.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 11:51, 24 March 2013 (UTC)

: Pi zero explains it the right way.  This page shouldn't really be used for an in-depth discussion of Wikibooks policy (unless the user initiates it).  The edit summary gave clear justification for deletion so nothing was even remotely wrong about QuiteUnusual's decision.  And, at the end of the day, anything deleted can be quickly restored if necessary.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 11:56, 24 March 2013 (UTC)
:: I agree that the material was justifiably deleted under the circumstances.  I would have done the same.  That the material was restored almost immediately shows that our system is working as intended.

== Proposal to implement metadata on Wikibooks==
Hi Neil,  
I wanted to give you an update on the previously discussed implementation of LRMI metatags on Wikibooks.  There is no longer the need to use the html tag extension as was discussed in the previous proposal, because it is now supported by core mediawiki. In addition, these changes sanction all mediawiki installations by default and increase the assurance of LRMI as a long-term standard.  If you're not familiar with  [http://schema.org/CreativeWork Schema.org], it is a shared collection of standard schemas that was developed by Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Yandex to allow webmasters to markup their pages in ways recognized by major search providers.  [http://wikisource-dev.wmflabs.org/w/index.php/CreativeWork This] page demonstrates these features in the context of wikisource and can demonstrate the optimization within a Google search engine [http://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/richsnippets?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwikisource-dev.wmflabs.org%2Fw%2Findex.php%2FMicrodata here].  With this said, let me know if you think it would be worthwhile to implement these metatags now that it will be done via Schema.org, or if you have further questions.

== HSC Information Processes and Technology - Automated Manuafacturing ==

Quiteunusual,

I feel you have been overly quick to delete the second posting of the Automated Manufacturing Page on Wikibooks. It was referenced with the link to the Board of Studies Site in the same way that the parent pages are referenced and there was only one section copied directly from the Board of Studies site which was clearly labelled as having been so copied. This section relates to Course outcomes and cannot be changed and must be referenced in order to give a learning context to the course. I understand that you are trying to keep the wikibooks site clear of copyright infringements but I am within the terms of use of the Board of Studies in that I am a teacher in NSW creating this page &quot;for the purposes of bona fide research and study&quot; (See the reference from the Board of Studies site below)

The Introduction to the course was my own work and although covers some similar content to that of the board of studies I think that should be understandable as it is a book based upon a documented course outlined by the Board. 

Can you please give further details as to why you have removed the page after the concerns you cited after the first removal were remedied. I have a class of students (and a greater body of students in the wider state) who do not have access to a current textbook covering this content and it is my intention to build one collaboratively to prepare them for their Higher School Certificate. 

I will follow any reference conventions you impose in order to get this content through your stringent quality control system. I have no intention to steal ideas or in other ways infringe on the right to copy of any author but I feel this page in its second posting was within the law.

==Featured books?==

I nominated my book (Historical Geology) as a featured book and no-one has said ''anything''. Is there something else I should do? Or maybe no-one's looking at the nominated books. It really is rather a good book. [[User:Actualist|Actualist]] ([[User talk:Actualist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Actualist|contribs]]) 16:23, 28 May 2013 (UTC)

:: Thanks. I see that it goes slowly, I wonder if it will ever happen at all. To be honest, posting this book on wikibooks has left me feeling very very depressed. It was my intention when I started writing it to give it away for free. So I wrote over 100,000 words, I put my heart into the book, I think it's better than most books on this subject, and now I don't even know if anyone's even read it, or ever will, or gives a damn.

== Blocking standards? ==

I don't do much blocking on Wikibooks, so I don't really have a sense of standards here.  On Wikinews, I'd take one look at [[Special:Contributions/Cheundgha|user Cheundgha]] and summarily indefblock with an informing template on their user talk.  But then, on Wikinews the blocking policy says that when to block is a matter of the admin's judgement but here are some ''guidelines'' &amp;mdash; so everything that follows is merely guidelines, and the only part of the whole page that's policy is the part that says it's up to the admin's judgement.  How would Wikibooks typically handle someone like this?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 20:32, 19 June 2013 (UTC)
:It's me from a mobile device so can't be bothered to login. I indef spammers on first offence and most vandals on first or second depending on the type of vandalism. The user can always appeal the block. There are too few admins to do anything else. Most of the spam blocks are based on CU evidence as the spam accounts have easily identifiable characteristics. So similar to WN really - it's an admin's judgement and my judgement is one strike and out [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 22:55, 19 June 2013 (UTC)

:Because you blanked the pages stating you were &quot;deleting&quot; the content. This is out of process - you need to either tag the page for speedy deletion or raise it at [[WB:RFD|requests for deletion]]. The original author, or other contributors, may not agree with you removing their contributions. [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 22:41, 22 June 2013 (UTC)
:: If the original author won't agree with my blanking, he can revert it. If by process you mean [[WB:RFD]], that seems rather broken. Pages sit there for months with no action. In any case, the original author cannot restore a page that was fully deleted, while he can restore a blanked page. So a soft-deleting via blanking actually seems a good unbureaucratic thing. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Dan Polansky|contribs]]) 23:29, 22 June 2013 (UTC)
:::I, and anyone else, can revert it if we don't agree - it doesn't need to be the original author. The point is '''you''' are not the original author so cannot unilaterally delete the content without some reasonable action. For example, you could ask for consensus from the authors by tagging it for speedy deletion or requesting a merge, move the content elsewhere and redirect the page or put it up for deletion. Leaving blank pages is just daft - an empty page that will confuse anyone who finds it as to its purpose.

:::::Because blanking is ridiculous - what kind of book has blank chapters?

:Well, normally there aren't book redirects like that because there is no obvious candidate for the redirect. For example, &quot;C&quot; could redirect to [[C Programming]], [[C# Programming]] and many others. Redirects to Subjects or Book Shelves are usually preferred.

== Review of contributions is causing duplication of work ==

Hi,
I am working with college students to develop a wikibook &quot;Biological Physics&quot;. We've noticed that our edits do not appear until they have been reviewed. They are often working independently to make contributions. I then intend to check their contributions periodically and give them feedback on their work. The review process on wikibooks seemingly causes duplication of work because students cannot instantly see and add to/edit what their peers have contributed. I understand the review is to avoid spamming and other issues, but is there a way to have our contributions posted instantly so that we aren't doing the same work multiple times?
Thanks for your help,
Troy

:For a logged in user the default is for them to see all edits - reviewed and unreviewed - whether they are reading or editing the page. The problem you are describing will only happen if they are logged out. As all your students presumably have accounts, the easiest way to avoid the problem is to ask them to ensure they are logged in.

== Unnecessarily deleted redirects ==

e.g. [[Cookbook:Gingerbread Cookies]]. This doesn't really count AFAICT, because A) It complies with the naming scheme, B) It's a very common name for the cookie, C) The redirect is not orphaned, it points to [[Cookbook:Molasses Cookies]] which is still there.

I know I've seen other redirects like this deleted, and I'd be happy to accept that if I understood why they were being torn out. It seems useful to redirect common names to the canonical article. --[[User:MarkTraceur|MarkTraceur]] ([[User talk:MarkTraceur|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MarkTraceur|contribs]]) 18:59, 17 December 2013 (UTC)
: Fwiw, an orphaned redirect is a redirect that isn't pointed to by anything, as opposed to a broken redirect which points to a page that doesn't exist.  Not that that necessarily sheds any light on whether a particular orphaned redirect should be deleted.
:: Oh, interesting. In this case I guess the other criterion (&quot;that do not conform with Wikibooks:Naming policy or where the names are unlikely to be inadvertently searched for by anyone&quot;) would save this because it complies with the naming policy and is likely to be searched for. --[[User:MarkTraceur|MarkTraceur]] ([[User talk:MarkTraceur|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/MarkTraceur|contribs]]) 21:45, 17 December 2013 (UTC)

== User page deleted due to spam ==

Hello,

I noticed you deleted my user page back in September (10:48, September 13, 2013) due to spam. Should I be worried? Was my account compromised or was this done by some other way? I don't remember logging in to WB since last August.

[[User:Meev0|Meev0]] ([[User talk:Meev0|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Meev0|contribs]]) 19:10, 4 February 2014 (UTC)
:Nothing to worry about it. An anonymous user operating a &quot;bot&quot; (an automated or semi automated script) was spamming by creating various user pages. Anyone can create a user page - even somebody else's - and the abuse filters are less restrictive for these compared to main space pages, hence they are a target for spam.

== Travel Guides ==

Hi there!

I just wondered whether you'd seen [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Proposals#Travel_Guides|the suggestion]] that I posted in the Reading Room to move much of Wikibooks' travel and tourism content across to Wikivoyage? I've yet to receive any responses to my post, so thought I'd show you, just to ensure that it doesn't go completely unnoticed - I really don't want to step on anyone's toes.

The Wikivoyage community [[:voy:Wikivoyage:Travellers'_pub#Wikibooks|appears to be happy]] with the move, but I'd prefer to get the Wikibooks' community's approval as well before I do anything.

Thanks very much,

* https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Trainz/Config.txt_Files&amp;action=history should have history preserved, but case 'un'corrected and moved so
... ends up here: [[Trainz/AM&amp;C/config.txt files]] with the header/stub templates therein.
* Trainz/Config.txt_Files should then be made a redirect as [[Trainz/config.txt_files]] (https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Trainz/config.txt_files&amp;redirect=no)

:You may not be able to copyright food, but that isn't relevant as you can certainly copyright a recipe. The recipe in question was copied directly from a website, that website carries no notice saying it is in the public domain therefore it is considered to be copyright unless proven otherwise. The absence of a copyright notice isn't relevant - copyright exists whether it is &quot;claimed&quot; or not. To substantiate a claim that a specific recipe is in the public domain you would need to provide a source that contains the recipe that is in the public domain. Absent this, the precautionary principle applies and copyright is assumed. Of course, you could simply create your own recipe. The specific issue is the copy and paste that occurred.

== [[Physic Book]] ==

Hi, I noticed that you deleted the [[Physic Book]] book and blocked the IP user who created it with the reasoning that they were abusing multiple accounts.  Was this based on similar previous experience or a CU?  I queried the book but never dug deeper into the matter. I'm just curious.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:01, 7 May 2014 (UTC)

== Curious ==

Although I am not a reviewer yet, but just wanted to ask something to both you and [[User:Xania|Xania]]. Is there anyway, we can stop IP's pilfering the data on the Wiki? I think so, there are ways, but then that might lead to many other good IP users denial of edit option. However, can you also tell me something? I can see the Yellow Review option in recent changes, however, I do not get any option of review or anything like that. I have now started seeing the same in en wiki, but still the same thing, cannot see any option to review. I knwo, I do not have the review option, but curious to know. Danke.

:I image you'll get the reviewer flag over the next week or so as you have around 100 edits, etc.  If you don't get it and want it just ask in the RfA page.  I have noticed the same thing that you mentioned - recently I saw the yellow Review options on Wikipedia but I am not a Reviewer there (previously blocked).  Also the same at Wikinews.  It seems strange that people are prompted to review things when they aren't able to.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:18, 15 May 2014 (UTC)
:: The last autopromotion criterion satisfied is usually &quot;8 edits are spaced 2 or more days apart from each other&quot;; assuming edits in userspace count toward this (which they do afaik), I think Harrybrowne1986 has five of these (15-May, 11-May, 5-May, 22-April, 20-March).  I'm curious to see when autopromote kicks in.

:: Iirc we've discussed at the reading room the annoying habit of the software to flag out unreviewed edits to users who can't do anything about it.  This makes some sense on Wikijunior where review status matters to non-reviewers, but otherwise it just gives people a motive to request reviewer privs early.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 19:25, 15 May 2014 (UTC)

:Actually, I was also wondering the same. Although I am keen on doing vandal checks, so as to keet WB vandal free, I am just able to &quot;Undo&quot;, even though there is a &quot;Rollback&quot; option in for me, which never works on WB, but works on EN Wiki. I am also, wanting to be a usercheck, as that would assist in getting rid of all unwanted edits that re done, though that would still be there. I have seen like EN Wiki, WB is also facing a lot of vandals, and quite a list of bad edits. I have been trying to keep those in proper manner, as you can see by my edits which I have done apart from contributing in the German lessons, and currently in WikiJunior books. I am not requesting any reviewer or usercheck as of now, until I have my autoconfirmed one. By the way, I am still unsure of how this &quot;8 edits are spaced 2 or more days apart from each other&quot;, and how can I check this count of mine? Danke.

:: In theory one could write a gadget to count a users's edits-spaced-2-days-apart, but it'd be a bunch of work for something everyone seems to agree would be nice.

:: So one does it by hand.  Look at your Special:Contributions ([[Special:MyContributions]]).  Let's say the most recent edit there is timestamped {{nowrap|05:24, 16 May 2014}}; call that &quot;one&quot;.  Now skip over all the edits on the list that were no more than 48 hours before that (i.e., everything since {{nowrap|05:24, 14 May 2014}}).  The next edit back is stamped {{nowrap|18:07, 11 May 2014}} (because there were two edits on {{nowrap|14 May}} but they were later than 05:24).  That's &quot;two&quot;.  Skip over all edits no more than 48 hours before that (i.e., since {{nowrap|18:07, 9 May 2014}}).  The next one back is {{nowrap|13:50, 5 May 2014}}; that's &quot;three&quot;.  And so on.

:: Btw, if you make one edit after about 10:00 today UTC (i.e., anytime from now on), then one of your edits on {{nowrap|14 May}} is more than 48 hours before that, and you've got, I believe, six instead of five.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 10:48, 16 May 2014 (UTC)

:Hmm. I think I get the major logic of this, but then anyone who has this clause, would become auto reviewer, and that can land a lot of trouble, being many spammers also there. You can see for yourself the count of vandal on WB has increased in recent times, and people, are making all sorts of contributions, in order to make life hell for others, like us. I propose, to get this auto consideration be changed, or make it a bit hard, like of other Wiki's. I understand we dont have many admins out here, active one's, but let us think of it. Danke.

:When I meant vandals, those were the ones, who might have done some edits, and have got through to the pages which might not require any reviews to be auto-posted as completed or revised edits, rather than drafts. Still, I might have not taken the particular knowledge base into account properly.

:BTW, I just saw I had overlooked a &quot;minor revision&quot; of the last rejection of yours at the Auto page.

I recently added a sandbox gadget to help people find where they can test things, which is enabled by default and includes a sandbox link for IP addresses too. I wonder if this is something that may need broader discussion. Is deleting IP address user subpages a common practice? Should the sandbox link be pointing IP addresses to [[Wikibooks:Sandbox]] instead? I am asking, because I noticed you had deleted an IP address sandbox recently, and IP address sandboxes could happen more often, left as is. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:27, 30 May 2014 (UTC)
:I usually delete IP user pages after a few days because they don't really serve a valid purpose. That is, they don't allow the IP editor to work in their &quot;own&quot; environment, as the IP could be used by somebody else, and could be confusing to the next person who happens along who was allocated that IP. If I was editing via an IP I wouldn't want to see a user page from the last person with a load of detail that didn't relate to me. I think we should do the same for IP User Talk pages once they are stale to remove old warnings.

:I deleted the one this morning because the editor had put &quot;I want this protected&quot; as a comment which suggested they intended to use it for an inappropriate person (inappropriate in the sense that they wanted to work on something in &quot;their&quot; space but didn't understand that editing via an IP means it could be changed by someone else). I don't think there is a major problem with having IP sandboxes any more than there's a problem with registered users having sandboxes, however, I see an IP sandbox as being temporary and deletable when it has been unused for a while rather than persistent until the registered editor requests deletion.

== About writing a Wikibook on Tor hidden services: Question about self-published *primary* sources (normally unreliable but Tor is an exception), and using *private* (not public) proxies to access Wikimedia ==

Hi,

You checked and approved my edits to the Wikibook [[Guide to Tor hidden services and elements of the Tor network]] (which I originally created a few months ago and haven't worked on since), which I quite appreciate.

I can't write this book all by myself, and am mainly trying to compose a good stub: filled with guidelines for future authors, as well as editorial precedents on Wikibooks and Wikipedia which could guide the creation of this article.

I don't want to be making up rules as I go along but:
* I suggested that all future authors use &lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;purple font&lt;/font&gt; (yes, they have to know some basic HTML) when making editorial comments (normally these would belong on the Discussion page, but sometimes they belong right next to the text they refer to, on the main page).
* I tried to do this in order to allow editors and fellow authors to comment on parts of the book that are under construction or that might be controversial.
* Please tell me whether using &lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;HTML purple font&lt;/font&gt; to label these comments, is OK under Wikibooks guidelines. If not, I can find another way to discuss changes with other editors (i.e. the Discussion page) but sometimes this seems more convenient.

'''In my opinion a guide to Tor hidden services and the Tor network''' is greatly needed---but it digresses (transgresses?) into a grey area where things are not fully covered by Wikibooks guidelines as to what sources are reliable/verifiable/notable--- this same issue caused my edits to get deleted from Wikipedia (an action I accept in practice but still dispute in theory).

'''If you know anything about Tor, you know that there is almost *no such thing* as a &quot;reliable&quot; secondary or tertiary source.''' This is why I accept Wikipedia's deletion of my edits and have moved the content to Wikibooks where I hope it will be accepted that I am making the best effort to keep my content reliable (and provide ample proof and first-hand evidence of its reliability). '''''However, it seems some editors on Wikipedia would rather accept unsourced content''''' than admit that the sources had to be on the Tor network itself. 

Basically, what I tried to do was to add Tor hidden services as sources about themselves on [[Wikipedia:List of Tor hidden services]], and cite their .onion addresses in the References list. This was in good faith. I understand why these edits were rejected '''but don't understand how they can reject my edits without having to delete the entire article because without &quot;my&quot; sources that I added, almost *all* of the material is unsourced'''. As I can firmly and easily establish (ask me for references), secondary sources, even media that's considered &quot;reliable&quot;, is often inaccurate about Tor.

Another thing I did was to '''use my own website as a source about itself''', since at the time I ran a Tor website which aimed to be a reliable directory of Tor hidden sites. (I no longer run it at this time and have removed or crossed out links to it.) '''Why I can justify this was,''' using primary sources '''''as sources about themselves''''' seems to be expressly permitted by Wikipedia (and Wikibooks) guidelines.

'''I was making *no* claim''' that my website was a reliable/verifiable/notable source about '''anything but itself'''---but I tried to make the point that '''neither is any other site on Tor''', even so-called secondary sources (The New York Times failed to publish the current address of Silk Road, for instance, in an article on Tor; they instead published an address that was months outdated). '''My actions were &quot;in good faith&quot;:''' because I made an earnest effort to ensure that all the content on my site was as reliable as any other source, and expressly noted  in the article discussion pages (in a way that could be substantiated with proof) that the other sources cited were no more reliable (including the ones that passed the &quot;notability&quot; and &quot;verifiablity&quot; tests).

&lt;u&gt;So I have to ask you the following two questions before I write any further:&lt;/u&gt;
# Can I use my own website as a source, (a) about itself, and (b) about other sites, if it can substantiate its own claims (i.e. if my site says a link works, you can click the link yourself and verify that it works, thus making it a verifiable primary source?)
# '''IMPORTANT QUESTION:''' Is it '''OK to use a proxy to access Wikipedia (and Wikibooks)?'''
## We're talking about a '''*private* proxy&quot;''', as opposed to an '''*open* proxy''' (which are already banned and blacklisted by Wikimedia). '''But *private* proxies are not banned, to my knowledge.''' Please correct me if this is wrong.
## I am '''NOT using a proxy to spam/vandalize,''' as you can see from my account and IP edit history; neither have been blacklisted, nor is there any reason to.
## I want to use a proxy to edit Wikibooks '''because I do business on Tor anonymously, and host websites anonymously, and &lt;u&gt;sharing what I know about Tor could be (at worst) incriminating and (at best) reveal things about my anonymous activities that I don't want to be traced back to my identity&lt;/u&gt;'''. I '''PRIVATELY LEASE the IP I am connecting from''', it is NOT shared by anyone else, and WILL NOT be used to spam/vandalize as long as I am in control of it. '''Please tell me if this is OK.'''
## I know Wikimedia bans editing from Tor, but this is totally different. Although I connect to the internet through Tor, it is rerouted through this unique IP that I privately lease. And therefore no spam will come from my IP address. '''PayPal, for instance, bans proxies/VPNs altogether''' but this is because it's illegal to conduct financial operations under an assumed identity. This case is totally different: I just want to write books as an anonymous author.
# '''If you tell me this is NOT OK,''' I can just go to a public library to edit Wikibooks anonymously although this is less convenient than a private proxy. '''I don't have to use a proxy,''' but I don't want to use my home computer directly to make these edits.

:Font colour - not a problem. Reliable sourcing is not considered a major issue here unless the subject is contentious (e.g., if it was negative material about a living person). You should have no problem using your website as a &quot;reference&quot; (let's call it an &quot;example&quot;). Wikimedia bans editing from Tor but it shouldn't cause you a problem editing from your registered account unless a global block is in place that prevents registered users editing. If this does impact you, we can flag your account as IP Block Exempt here. [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 09:43, 8 July 2014 (UTC)

== Well I'd love it if you'd make me exempt from IP blocks ==

I say this because currently I'm paying for a (private) proxy (as I mentioned above) --- basically paying so that I can connect through Tor and then reroute my connection through a proxy that isn't blacklisted by Wikimedia. I understand why this is necessary (and necessarily to comply with Wikimedia's &quot;No Open Proxies&quot; policy) because connecting through this IP address proves I'm me as opposed to a spammer/vandal.

Still, this isn't necessary, because when I log in with my username/password it proves I'm me (and am responsible for my edits) as opposed to a spammer/vandal. While people who use Tor or open proxies may want to vandalize and should be blocked in general, when a Tor/open proxy connects through my account, it will always be me.

So I would love to be placed on the whitelist.

Thank you if you can do this: from Wikimedia policy [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Open proxies]],

:::''&quot;for example, editors in countries where Wikipedia is censored, such as China, should sign up for free access to Wikipedia-only proxies at Wikipedia:WikiProject on closed proxies or read Wikipedia:Advice to users using Tor to bypass the Great Firewall. Additionally, because of the creation of the IP block exemption flag, '''editors,''' like those in China, '''who have a demonstrated need to use proxies or Tor to edit may be given the ability to edit from blocked IPs.''' See Wikipedia:IP block exemption for more.&quot;''

So I don't quite have a &quot;need&quot; to use blocked IPs, but being able to edit through Tor may save me money on an extra private proxy, as well as allow me to edit from more private anonymous locations like public libraries (even high schools if I ever wind up back in one).

There ''are'' things I would be able to say about Tor in Wikibooks that I wouldn't be willing to say if it could be traced to me, so this helps.

'''Oh, one other reason.''' I am considering running a '''Tor exit relay''' from my home internet connection. If I do this, I will be blocked from editing Wikipedia/Wikibooks even from my house unless my account is exempt from IP blocks.

&lt;u&gt;'''Thanks if you can help me.'''&lt;/u&gt;

== Groups of vandal IPs ==

I've been noticing, just lately, groups of similar IPs collaborating to do whole batteries of vandalism edits to a page.  The purpose, I'm guessing, is to try to trick counter-vandal editors into using rollback and failing to notice that their rollback only removed a little of the vandalism.  (Fortunately, rejecting the edits on a sighted page removes it all in one stroke even though rollback wouldn't.)  Have you observed this vandalism technique?

== An important message about renaming users ==

&lt;div class=&quot;mw-content-ltr&quot;&gt;
Dear QuiteUnusual,

I am cross-posting this message to many places to make sure everyone who is a Wikimedia Foundation project bureaucrat receives a copy. If you are a bureaucrat on more than one wiki, you will receive this message on each wiki where you are a bureaucrat.

As you may have seen, work to perform the Wikimedia cluster-wide [[mw:SUL finalisation|single-user login finalisation]] (SUL finalisation) is taking place. This may potentially effect your work as a local bureaucrat, so please read this message carefully.

Why is this happening? As currently stated at [[m:Global rename policy|the global rename policy]], a global account is a name linked to a single user across all Wikimedia wikis, with local accounts unified into a global collection. Previously, the only way to rename a unified user was to individually rename every local account. This was an extremely difficult and time-consuming task, both for stewards and for the users who had to initiate discussions with local bureaucrats (who perform local renames to date) on every wiki with available bureaucrats. The process took a very long time, since it's difficult to coordinate crosswiki renames among the projects and bureaucrats involved in individual projects. 

The SUL finalisation will be taking place in stages, and one of the first stages will be to turn off Special:RenameUser locally. This needs to be done as soon as possible, on advice and input from Stewards and engineers for the project, so that no more accounts that are unified globally are broken by a local rename to usurp the global account name. Once this is done, the process of global name unification can begin. The date that has been chosen to turn off local renaming and shift over to entirely global renaming is 15 September 2014, or three weeks time from now. In place of local renames is a new tool, hosted on Meta, that allows for global renames on all wikis where the name is not registered will be deployed. 

Your help is greatly needed during this process and going forward in the future if, as a bureaucrat, renaming users is something that you do or have an interest in participating in. The Wikimedia Stewards have set up, and are in charge of, a new community usergroup on Meta in order to share knowledge and work together on renaming accounts globally, called [[m:Global renamers|Global renamers]]. Stewards are in the process of creating documentation to help global renamers to get used to and learn more about global accounts and tools and Meta in general as well as the application format. As transparency is a valuable thing in our movement, the Stewards would like to have at least a brief public application period. If you are an experienced renamer as a local bureaucrat, the process of becoming a part of this group could take as little as 24 hours to complete. You, as a bureaucrat, should be able to apply for the global renamer right on Meta by the [[m:SRGP|requests for global permissions]] page on 1 September, a week from now.

In the meantime please update your local page where users request renames to reflect this move to global renaming, and if there is a rename request and the user has edited more than one wiki with the name, please send them to [[:m:SRUC|the request page for a global rename]].

Stewards greatly appreciate the trust local communities have in you and want to make this transition as easy as possible so that the two groups can start working together to ensure everyone has a unique login identity across Wikimedia projects. Completing this project will allow for long-desired universal tools like a global watchlist, global notifications and many, many more features to make work easier.

If you have any questions, comments or concerns about the SUL finalisation, read over the [[m:SUL|Help:Unified login]] page on Meta and leave a note on the talk page there, or on the talk page for [[m:Talk:Global renamers|global renamers]]. You can also contact me on [[m:User talk:Keegan (WMF)|my talk page on meta]] if you would like. I'm working as a bridge between Wikimedia Foundation Engineering and Product Development, Wikimedia Stewards, and you to assure that SUL finalisation goes as smoothly as possible; this is a community-driven process and I encourage you to work with the Stewards for our communities.

Thank you for your time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is the collection of R recipes for the analysis of one factor, two level experiments.  Each of these recipes are structured in the ''Setting, Design, Analysis'' paradigm and the ''Design'' portion is structured in four parts: ''Exploratory Analysis, Testing, Estimation and Model Adequacy Checking.''

Put your recipes here.&lt;br /&gt;

-&gt; These data are a collection of various measures, including variables such as elevation, temperature (surface and air), ozone, air pressure, and cloud cover. For this section, a t-test was conducted to explore whether a statistically significant difference existed between the two temperature variables. The H0 was that no difference existed between the mean temperature values of both factors, whereas the HA was that a statistically significant difference existed between the two factors. Based on the results of the test, the H0 was rejected W.R.T. an alpha value of .05. However, after model adequacy checking was performed, the results were invalidated due to the fact that the t-test assumes normality, and the Shapiro-Wilks normality test confirmed that the data are not normal. Further steps to &quot;coerce&quot; the data to be normally distributed include performing data transformations, but this action has not yet been completed.

-&gt; The following is an analysis of a data set which includes a collection of wind speed, barometric pressure, longitude, latitude and time points for a large number of storms recorded by NASA. In my analysis I decided to examine if there was a significant statistical difference in the wind speed and pressure readings between hurricanes and extratropical storms. This analysis was performed through the use of a t-test and a QQ plot as a check for model adequacy. http://rpubs.com/adamato/28910&lt;br /&gt;

-&gt; Using fuel economy data from the EPA collected from 1985-2015, a one-factor, two-level experiment is performed to see if the “make” of a vehicle has a statistically significant effect on the fuel economy of that vehicle. The two “makes” that are considered in this analysis include ‘Toyota’ and ‘Audi’. Additionally, this analysis separately considers two different metrics for measuring fuel economy, including both highway fuel economy [in mpg] (“hwy”) and city fuel economy [in mpg] (“cty”). Upon performing this analysis, it was determined that the fact that these two vehicles are classified by different “makes” likely &lt;i&gt;does appear to have an effect&lt;/i&gt; on the average &lt;i&gt;city fuel economy&lt;/i&gt; that is achieved when driving either “make” of vehicle. However, the fact that these two vehicles are classified by different “makes” &lt;i&gt;does not appear to have an effect&lt;/i&gt; on the average &lt;i&gt;highway fuel economy&lt;/i&gt; that is achieved when driving either “make” of vehicle. - Brendan Howell
&lt;br&gt;http://rpubs.com/howelb/29127&lt;br/&gt;

-&gt; The following analysis is conduced based on the EPA fuel economy data from 1985 to 2015. To explore the effect of vehicle engine power (number of cylinders) on fuel economy, a one factor (number of cylinders), two level (cyl = 4 and cyl = 6) experiment was carried out and a linear regression model is estimated to quantify the marginal effect. The result shows that the vehicle fuel economy decreases with the number of cylinders in the vehicle.  http://rpubs.com/serena049/doehw1&lt;br /&gt;

-&gt; The html file below utilizes fuel economy data that has been collect by the EPA from 1985 to 2015. Specific data is analyzed to conduct a one-factor, two-level experiment to determine if the variation in the make of a vehicle is responsible for the variation in highway gas mileage. The factor, &quot;make,&quot; is grouped into two levels, &quot;Toyota&quot; and &quot;Honda,&quot; with a response variable of &quot;hwy&quot; (the highway mileage). An unpaired, two-sample t-test, with a null hypothesis that the highway mileage means of both vehicle makes are equal, will be conducted.

This analysis utilizes ‘nycflights13’ data set containing all information about flights that departed from NYC (JFK, EWR and LGA) in 2013. There are 336,776 flights in total. In order to study the underlying causes of flight delay an experiment was conducted which can be termed as ‘one factor- two level’ experiment. Here ‘time-delay’ is the factor and ‘departure time-delay’ and ‘arrival time-delay’ are two levels. We conduct a t-test to test the null hypothesis , ‘mean of the departure time delay is equal to the mean of the arrival time delay’. This is essentially to try and test whether there are other factors that contribute to the delay of an aircraft apart from the delay in its take-off time. For this purpose we take a sub-set of the data (only UA flights departing from JFK). Our t-test experiment leads to the rejection of the null hypothesis. However, our exploratory data analysis as well as diagnostic check leads us to the conclusion that the data is not normally distributed. Therefore the assumption based on which we conduct the t-test is flawed. This leads us to the conclusion that our t-test is not valid for our current data set.

The following analysis is based on the data set called 'nasaweather' collected from National Hurricane Center. It takes the classification of different types of storms and their respective air pressure measurement to perform a t-test.  As you will see in the analysis, the results show that we reject the null hpothesis that the means of Tropical Storms does not equal the means of Hurricanes. http://rpubs.com/hsiac/28942&lt;br /&gt;


The following analysis investigates if electric/hybrid cars are actually more fuel efficient than cars with more traditional gasoline engines.  This analysis looked at both highway and city driving where the data was derived from an EPA fuel economy dataset from 1985 to 2015.  Individual analyses of highway and city driving were conducted in a one-factor, two-level manner using t-tests.  Cars with electric/hybrid engines were determined to get significantly better gas mileage than cars with traditional gasoline engines on the highway as well as around the city.  http://rpubs.com/JohnMariani/28953&lt;br /&gt;

-&gt;The following link utilizes the R data &quot;storms&quot; from the &quot;nasaweather&quot; package.  &quot;Storms&quot; includes 4 observations a day for every storm named from 1995 to 2000.  The storm name, year, month, day, hour, latitude, longitude, pressure, wind speed, and type of storm were recorded for each observation.  This analysis will focus on only two of the observations a day (hour 0 and 12) and one factor, two level testing to examine if the variation in wind could be explained by the hour of each day.  Exploritory data analysis, a t-test, and normality testing is performed.  There is also a section at the end that covers contingencies if the assumptions are broken.
http://rpubs.com/svoboa/28937 &lt;br /&gt;

The following analysis is based on the 'nycflights13' dataset which contains information of flights from NYC, including JFK, EWR and LGA. Also plane information and weather condition are recorded in this dataset. It is known to all that several airlines are usually not on time, and this analysis is in order to test effect of airlines on time delay and help passengers choose the best one. We take test for Delta Airline as an example, considering it as a 'one factor - two level' model, where 'departure delay' and 'arrival delay' are two levels. To block possible cofounding factros we only select flights from JFK. T-test shows there is no relationship between two factors, however, following tests reveal that data is not normally distributed, therefore it is not correct to conduct t-test in this case. This analysis is the first version, it is still needed to be improved in the future. http://rpubs.com/chenh16/29271

-&gt; The following is an experiment designed to investigate the relationship between year and storm wind speed from the 'nasaweather' dataset. The experiment will look into the normality of the data and also attempt to discover whether or not there is a significant difference between of the means via two-sample t-test.
http://rpubs.com/macchm/30638 &lt;br /&gt;

-&gt;This experiment is testing to see if there are differences in the Mean Surface Temperature from Clear Sky Composite and Mean Near-Surface Air Temperature in the month of January. The Mean Surface Temperature from Clear Sky Composite is the monthly mean temperature based on the energy being emitted from the Earth’s surface under clear sky conditions in K. The Mean Near-Surface Air Temperature is the monthly mean temperature of the air near the surface of the Earth in K.

-&gt; The following link is an experiment that utilizes flight data from NYC, in particular date of flight, departure and arrival times, departure and arrival times, departure and arrival locations and some information about the plane. The experiment looks to examine the effects of the origin on the departure delay time. The assumption being that the a flight's delay is due to the problems in the departure airport. The study firsts looks to explore the data with summary statistics, box plots and histograms. The data is analyzed using t-tests and the normality of the data is also checked using QQ plots and the Shapiro-Wilk test. Lastly it addresses possible contingencies in the experiment. http://rpubs.com/Tothk2/31630 -By Kevin Toth &lt;br /&gt;

-&gt; The following analysis examined flight data from planes leaving from three of New York City's major airports. The data includes factors such as the the date, the time of arrival/departure, the arrival/departure delays, the airline carrier, the origin and destination, along with multiple others. In particular, this experiment analyzed delays, and how they are related to the origin and departure city, along with the specific airline carrier responsible for the flights. A one factor, two level t-test was completed for two different airline carriers and two different origin locations. Unfortunately, after completing a Shapiro-Wilks test for normality, it was found that the data is nonparametric, and would therefore need additional testing using nonparametric methods. http://rpubs.com/braunj6/31855 &lt;br/&gt;

===&quot;Non-blocking&quot; Linkbot Functions===

Lets take an inventory of all of the functions that we've used so far to control various aspects of the Linkbot.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Function Name !! Function Description
|-
| &lt;code&gt;setLEDColor(r, g, b)&lt;/code&gt; || Changes the LED color based on red, green, and blue intensities.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;setBuzzerFrequency(Hz)&lt;/code&gt; || Makes the Linkbot buzzer play a frequency in Hertz.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;moveJoint(jointNum, degrees)&lt;/code&gt; || Makes a single motor move.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;move(degrees, degrees, degrees) &lt;/code&gt; || Makes multiple motors move simultaneously
|}

Using these functions, we can move our robot around, change the robot's LED color, and make the robot beep or play simple melodies. However, using only these functions, it is not possible to make a robot play a tune and change its LED colors while the robot is moving. For example, lets say we want to make our robot beep 2 times _while_ our robot is moving. We can try something like this:
{{Message box|heading = Note! | message=
The examples in this section are presented without the necessary initializing code shown in previous chapters. To run these examples, you will need to include the following lines of code at the top of your program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
import barobo
dongle = barobo.Dongle()
dongle.connect()
myLinkbot = dongle.getLinkbot('ABCD') # Replace 'ABCD' with your Linkbot's ID
&lt;/source&gt;
}}
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(440)  # 1
time.sleep(0.25)                   # 2
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(0)    # 3
time.sleep(0.25)                   # 4
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(440)
time.sleep(0.25)
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(0)
time.sleep(0.25)
myLinkbot.move(180, 0, -180)       # 5
&lt;/source&gt;
Lets reason our way through each major point of this program.

# First, we turn on the buzzer on the Linkbot. It starts buzzing
# Pause the program for 0.25 seconds
# Turn off the Linkbot's buzzer. 
# Pause the program for another 0.25 seconds. The end result of steps 1-4 is that the Linkbot buzzes its buzzer for 0.25 seconds. The next four lines do the same exact thing.
# At this point, the Linkbot has buzzed twice, and now the &lt;code&gt;move()&lt;/code&gt; function makes the Linkbot roll forward.

This is &lt;i&gt;almost&lt;/i&gt; what we want to do, except we want the robot to beep twice &lt;i&gt;while&lt;/i&gt; the robot is moving; not before it starts moving. Lets try again:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
myLinkbot.move(180, 0, -180)       # 1
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(440)  # 2
time.sleep(0.25)                   
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(0)    
time.sleep(0.25)                   
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(440)
time.sleep(0.25)
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(0)
time.sleep(0.25)
&lt;/source&gt;

This program is almost exactly the same as the program before except we relocated the &lt;code&gt;move()&lt;/code&gt; function to the beginning of the program. Will this program make the robot beep twice as the robot is moving?

# First, we call the &lt;code&gt;move()&lt;/code&gt; function which moves the robot's motors. The robot begins moving. However, the program stays at item 1 until the &lt;code&gt;move()&lt;/code&gt; function is completed. After the robot finishes moving, the program continues.
# Here, the robot turns the buzzer on similar to the previous example. Using &lt;code&gt;setBuzzerFrequency()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;time.sleep()&lt;/code&gt;, it makes the buzzer beep twice.

===The &lt;code&gt;moveNB()&lt;/code&gt; Function===
As we can see, we have failed yet again to make the robot beep twice while moving. In order to make the robot do these things simultaneously, we must use a similar but new type of function: Non-blocking functions. Lets take a look at an example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
myLinkbot.moveNB(180, 0, -180)     # 1
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(440)  # 2
time.sleep(0.25)                   
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(0)    
time.sleep(0.25)                   
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(440)
time.sleep(0.25)
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(0)
time.sleep(0.25)
&lt;/source&gt;

# Here, instead of using the &lt;code&gt;move()&lt;/code&gt; function, we use the &lt;code&gt;moveNB()&lt;/code&gt; function.
The &quot;NB&quot; in the function name stands for &quot;non-blocking&quot;. 
Both functions move the motors on the Linkbot, but there is one important difference: The NB version of the function &quot;returns&quot; immediately. What this means is Python continues on to the next line of code immediately without waiting for the movement to finish first. In other words, the &lt;code&gt;moveNB()&lt;/code&gt; function does not &quot;block&quot; Python from continuing on immediately after the function is called. 
# Now, the Linkbot begins playing its buzzer while the Linkbot is still moving. We've accomplished our task! This program will move the robot and beep twice while the robot is moving.

===The &lt;code&gt;moveWait()&lt;/code&gt; Function===
Now lets try one more example. Lets say we want to make the robot move its wheels 180 degrees to roll forward while beeping twice, and then change the LED color to green &lt;i&gt;after&lt;/i&gt; the movement is done. To accomplish this, we introduce the &lt;code&gt;moveWait()&lt;/code&gt; function. Lets take a look and see how it works:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
myLinkbot.moveNB(180, 0, -180)     # 1
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(440)  # 2
time.sleep(0.25)                   
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(0)    
time.sleep(0.25)                   
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(440)
time.sleep(0.25)
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(0)
time.sleep(0.25)
myLinkbot.moveWait()               # 3
myLinkbot.setLEDColor(0, 255, 0)   # 4
&lt;/source&gt;

# As before, this line tells the robot to begin moving motors 1 and 3. Since we used the &quot;NB&quot; version of the function, Python continues directly on to the next line of code even though the robot is still moving.
# The next several lines of code beep the robot twice, similar to before.
# Here, we call a function called &lt;code&gt;moveWait()&lt;/code&gt;. This function blocks until all motor movements on the robot are finished. In effect, Python will wait at # 3 until the motors are done moving.
# Here, we set the LED color to green. 

If we had omitted &lt;code&gt;moveWait()&lt;/code&gt; at # 3, the LED color would've been set whether the motors were still moving or not. By using the &lt;code&gt;moveWait()&lt;/code&gt; function, we force Python to wait for the motors to stop moving before setting the LED color.

===Other Non-Blocking Functions===
Almost all Linkbot movement commands have a non-blocking version with the &quot;NB&quot; suffix. The ones that do not have a non-blocking version are the ones that move a Linkbot's motor continuously forever. We haven't explored any of them yet, but they are out there. These functions do not have non-blocking versions because they would block forever.

All of the functions that begin with the prefix &quot;set&quot;, such as &lt;code&gt;setBuzzerFrequency()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;setLEDColor()&lt;/code&gt;, can be considered non-blocking because of how fast the buzzer and LED colors are set. For instance, if you run the following snippet of code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
myLinkbot.setBuzzerFrequency(440)
myLinkbot.setLEDColor(0, 255, 0)
&lt;/source&gt;
The Linkbot would appear to start buzzing and change the LED color to green simultaneously. Technically, the robot is actually doing one before the other, but the two things happen so fast (typically within 5 milliseconds of each other) that it is practically simultaneous.

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_of_a_function Roots (or Zeros) of a function f(x)] are values of x that produces an output of 0. Roots can be real or complex numbers. Finding the root of &lt;math&gt;f(x)-g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the same as solving the equation &lt;math&gt;f(x) = g(x)&lt;/math&gt;. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equation_solving Solving an equation] is finding the values that satisfy the condition specified by the equation.

Lower degree (quadratic, cubic, and quartic) polynomials have closed-form solutions, but numerical methods may be easier to use. 
To solve a quadratic equation we can use the quadratic formula:

:&lt;math&gt;ax^2+bx+c=0&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac\ }}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;

There are many [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-finding_algorithm root-find algorithms] for solving equations numerically.

==Bisection Method==
The bisection method starts with two guesses and uses a binary search algorithm to improve the answers. If a function is continuous between the two initial guesses, the bisection method is guaranteed to converge. Here is a picture that illustrates the idea:

[[File:Bisection method.svg|400px|A few steps of the bisection method applied over the starting range [a1;b1]. The bigger red dot is the root of the function.]]

The advantages of bisection method include guaranteed convergence on continuous functions and the error is bounded.

The disadvantages of bisection method include relatively slow convergence and non convergence on certain functions.
 
&lt;!--
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def function(x):
  return x**3-x-2

# inputs: function f, endpoint values a, b, tolerance
#         maximum iterations nmax
# output: value differs from a root of f(x)=0 by less
#         than tolerance
def bisection(f, a, b, tolerance, nmax = 100):
  i = 1
  while i &lt;= nmax:
    c = (a+b)/2.0
    if f(c) == 0 or (b-a)/2.0 &lt; tolerance:
      print &quot;solution is &quot;, c
      break;
    if f(a)*f(c) &gt; 0: # same sign
      a = c
    else:
      b = c
    i+=1
  if i&gt;nmax:
    print &quot;method failed.&quot;

bisection(function, 1, 2, 0.0001, 20)
&lt;/source&gt;
--&gt;
==Newton-Raphson Method==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method Newton's Method] (a.k.a Newton-Raphson Method) is an open method for solving non-linear equations. Contrary to a bracketing-method (e.g. bisection method) Newton's method needs one initial guess but it doesn't guarantee to converge. 

The basic idea of Newton's method is as follows:
: Given a function ''f'' of &quot;x&quot; and a initial guess &lt;math&gt;x_{0}&lt;/math&gt; for the root of this function, a better guess &lt;math&gt;x_{1}&lt;/math&gt; is 
:&lt;math&gt;x_{1} = x_0 - \frac{f(x_0)}{f'(x_0)} &lt;/math&gt;
: This is the Newton-Raphson formula.

The following animation illustrates the method:

[[File:NewtonIteration Ani.gif|400px|The function ƒ is shown in blue and the tangent line is in red. We see that xn+1 is a better approximation than xn for the root x of the function f.]]

Lets solve the following equations using Newton's method:
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^{2}+2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=sin(x)=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=a-\frac{1}{x}=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from sympy import Symbol, diff, sin
x = Symbol('x')
y = sin(x)
derivative = diff(y, x)

&lt;/source&gt;

===Limitations of Newton's Method===
====Division by Zero====
Because a division is involved in Newton's formula when the denominator becomes zero the method won't continue correctly. The following program demonstrates this issue.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
from sympy import Symbol, diff
x = Symbol('x')
y = 4 - 1.0/x
derivative = diff(y, x)

'''
Solve f with initial guess g using Newton's method.
Stop when the absolute relative approximate error is
smaller than the tolerance or the max # iterations
is reached.
'''      
def newton(f, derivative, g, tolerance, max_iteration):
  x_previous = g
  for i in range(max_iteration):
    x_current = x_previous - \
      y.subs(x, x_previous)/derivative.subs(x, x_previous)

    error = abs((x_current-x_previous)/x_current) 
    print &quot;current x:&quot;, x_current, &quot; error:&quot;, error
    
    x_previous = x_current

    if error &lt; tolerance:
      break;

newton(y, derivative, 0.5, 0.005, 15)
&lt;/source&gt;
Output:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$ python newton.py 
current x: 0  error: oo
current x: nan  error: nan
current x: nan  error: nan
current x: nan  error: nan
current x: nan  error: nan
current x: nan  error: nan
...
&lt;/source&gt;

====Divergence at Inflection Points====
When the initial guess is near a [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection_point inflection point] the method may diverge from the desired root.

The following code using the same implementation of Newton's method (assume the newton function is imported) demonstrates divergence at an inflection point (x=0).
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
from sympy import Symbol, diff
x = Symbol('x')
y = (x-1)**3 + 0.5

derivative = diff(y, x)
newton(y, derivative, 5, 0.005, 15)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

==Secant Method==
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secant_method Secant method] is similar to Newton's method in that it is an open method and use a intersection to get the improved estimate of the root. Secant method avoids calculating the first derivatives by estimating the derivative values using the slope of a secant line. 

The following figure illustrates the secant method with two initial guesses and two successive improved estimates:
[[File:Secant method.svg|400px|The first two iterations of the secant method. The red curve shows the function f and the blue lines are the secants. For this particular case, the secant method will not converge.]]

The formula for secant method is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;
x_{i+1}
=x_{i}-\frac{f(x_{i})(x_{i}-x_{i-1})}{f(x_{i})-f(x_{i-1})}
&lt;/math&gt;

==False-Position Method==
The false-position method is similar to the bisection method in that it requires two initial guesses (bracketing method). Instead of using the midpoint as the improved guess, the false-position method use the root of secant line that passes both end points. The following figure illustrates the idea.
[[File:False position method.svg|400px|The first two iterations of the false position method. The red curve shows the function f and the blue lines are the secants.]]  

The formula for false-position method is as follows:
:&lt;math&gt;x_{r}=\frac{x_uf(x_l) - x_lf(x_u)}{f(x_l) - f(x_u)}&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Expanding on the Event Loop=

In the first section, we covered the basic concepts of an event loop: we have an environment, into which we place entities; an 'event loop' will monitor the state of the environment and notify the entities of changes, which we view as events.
We can see how this process describes how our widgets work, but there is one significant thing that widgets do that is not captured in this process: widgets can draw themselves.

Last chapter, we mentioned that 'progress bars' can be placed in 'indeterminate mode', in which they will run an animation; we asserted that this indicates to the user that the application has not terminated; we did not discuss why this is the case.

In this chapter, we will modify the event loop that we developed previously to include the entities 'updating' their representation, from which we will develop the idea of the widgets 'drawing'.

=The Event Loop=

Recall the event loop from chapter one.
As an abstract:
*Set up entities
*Event Loop:
**Detect changes
**Generate events

This allows us to detect and respond to changes in the environment; if this loop runs quickly enough that the delay in responding to a change is imperceptible to a human user, we say that it runs in 'real time'.

Consider what form our responses take; in our simple example, we were only concerned with printing a message or calling some function in response to an event.
But what if we want to change the properties of the entities themselves?
In the particular case of widgets, what if we want to change their graphical representation - like when a button renders itself differently while it is being pressed?

=Drawing=

Let us add to the entities in our simple event loop a step in which the entities represent themselves to the environment - in the specific case of widgets, a step in which they 'draw' themselves.
We will place it after the event-processing step, so that changes caused by the events will be reflected when the widgets redraw themselves.
We then have the resulting loop:
*Set up entities
*Event Loop:
**Detect changes
**Generate events
**Update representation (Draw)

Consider the placement of the represent/draw step; it is a distinct step, after events are generated (and handled).
The reader might wonder why we do not redraw the widgets 'during' the event loop, perhaps when they receive events; it might reasonably seem that, if widgets were redrawn when and only when they received events, that this might save us having to redraw widgets that have not changed.
There are several problems with this: on is that our widgets could potentially receive more than one event in a single pass of the event loop.
This could result in our widgets needlessly re-drawing themselves several times.
This problem is gets worse if a change in a widget's state (including its properties) caused it to change size, which might generate more events and cause an explosive growth of needles widget re-draws.
Worse, in extreme cases, this might even cause recurrent event generation.

The solution is to mark the widgets when their properties  are changed by an event, and only re-draw the widgets so marked (or 'damaged') in the drawing step.
This allows us to only draw widgets that have changed, while not redrawing the same widget multiple times per pass.

=Animations and the Indeterminate Progress Bar=

Consider a widget that is displaying an 'animation' of some type, like the pulsing animation of the indeterminate progress-bar.
The widget might do this by correlating each frame to a certain 'time', and then marking itself as 'damaged' in its own draw function.
When its draw function is called, it checks the time; if the time for its next frame has elapsed, it redraws itself.
Whether the time has elapsed or not, it marks itself as damaged, so that it will check as often as the event loop runs.

This scheme will allow the widget to show its animation, but it is inelegant; it requires the event loop to constantly poll our widget.
What if we added a 'timer event' to our kit?
Suppose that we attach a timer event to some object, and allow the object to set a time for the event-loop to trigger the timer event.
Then the event loop could keep track of the progress of time for us.

In either case, the event loop must keep running for our widget to redraw itself: if the event loop stops, the animation stops.
This is how the indeterminate progress bar tells the user that our application is still running - or, at the very least, that the event loop is still running.

=Layouts and the Expanded Event Loop=

As a final observation, consider what happens if an event results in a change in the physical configuration; then our layout needs to be re-computed.
We can insert a 'perform layouts' step between the event-processing and drawing steps; we will put it after events have been processed for much the same reason that we placed the draw step after all events have been processed; before the draw step, so that the widgets will draw themselves with the appropriate size and positioning.

The resulting application process, with the event loop embedded with in, is:
*Set up entities
*Event Loop:
**Detect changes
**Generate events
***Mark changed widgets
**Update layout (of damaged widgets)
**Draw (damaged widgets)

=Layout and Draw as events=

The student might wonder what the layout and drawing machinery looks like.
If an entity is a class - like our &lt;code&gt;AbstractWidget&lt;/code&gt; class - then that class might include 'layout' and 'draw' functions.
The &lt;code&gt;AbstractWidget&lt;/code&gt; might include useful default implementation of these functions (most will), so that &lt;code&gt;AbstractWidget&lt;/code&gt; can lay their children out and draw themselves without requiring us to add any code.
However, we may also be able to 'override' these functions, to provide our own drawing methods and our own sizing logic.

The student might wonder if 'layout' and 'draw' are (or can be viewed as) events; they are steps in the event loop, after all.
This depends on the kit: in some kits, 'layouts' and 'draw' are event, while in others they are not; they are simply special functions, as described above.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Up to now, we have been discussing the widgets that we will compose to create our interfaces; the background of this discussion has been the process of creating GUIs by placing some of the component widgets into basic widgets (or some other analogous structure).
But our applications cannot consist of a single screen; in this chapter, we will have our first discussion of having multiple active windows

=Dialogs and Windows=

Almost every toolkit will give us the ability to create multiple windows and dialogs at a time.
This might seem unusual at first; how does the system keep track of which windows belong to which applications?

Many operating systems will treat windows as 'system resources' that a given process can 'own', much like files or memory.
In the same way that an application can request multiple files, the application can request multiple windows; much like file objects abstract the OS's low-level file access system, our tool-kit will likely provide us with some high level class that represents the window resource that the OS gives us.
For convenience, our tool-kits may also provide us with a class that both manages a window and inherits from &lt;code&gt;BasicWidget&lt;/code&gt;.

Notice that the event loop as we have developed it can flexibly adapt to a single application having multiple windows.

=What Ends the Application=

Having multiple windows requires us to think about what ends our application - and how we end our application.

To answer the last question first, we can end our application by telling the event loop to stop; if the event loop was the last thing in our main file, then, after program flow leaves the event loop, our main function will return and our application will end.
Many kits will provide us with a function to tell the event loop to terminate for precisely this purpose.

To answer the first question, perhaps the most obvious way is to attach a callback to some event, and to call the end-event-loop function in that callback.
The most obvious time to do so would be when some privileged window is closed; if our application provides us with an an_window_close event, we can register a callback to this event (on some particular main window) and call the end-event-loop callback in that function.

Since this is a fairly wrote task, many kits provide us with a convenience function that automates this process; jave, for example, as the &quot;set_default_close_operation&quot; function, which allows us to tell Swing to perform some specific operation when our window closes.

=Modality=

Sometimes, we want to block the user's access to other parts of an application while a particular screen is being displayed; this might be the case if, for example, if the user is interacting with a settings dialog that will affect the primary screen.
Most kits provide us with the ability to mark certain windows as 'modal' with respect to other windows; if a child window is modal with respect to a given parent window, then the user will not be able to interact with the parent window while the child window is being displayed.
As the reader may have guessed, most 'dialog windows' are modal.

=Dialogs=

Dialogs are special windows; they are used to display alerts to the user (such as an alert box reporting an application failure), or to ask the user to make a decision (such as a dialog asking the user if they wish to save a document or not) or for more detailed interactions (such as a file selection or color selection dialog).
In principle, dialogs are nothing more than modal windows that display appropriate contents, and we could create them by creating top-level windows, packing those windows with children, marking them as modal with respect to the application's main window, and then marking them as visible.
We typically will not build dialogs by hand, however, for two major reason.
The first is that building a dialog by hand is a tedious process, and one that can be easily automated.
The second, more important reason is 'platform integration'; users have expectations about how familiar dialogs will behave, based on how the other dialogs on their platforms behave.
If we create our dialogs by hand, we will have to reproduce every behavior of the platform's default dialog - every keyboard shortcut, ever feature.
If we do not, the user's interaction with our application will be disrupted when they discover that they cannot trigger our dialog's 'cancel' action by hitting escape - because we would have had to replicate that behavior in specific code, and perhaps we did not think to, or did not have time.

Because of the first reason, almost every kit in existence will provide you with a selection of dialogs, and convenience-functions to display the, for the second reason, you should use these default dialogs wherever possible.

=Show Functions=

Many kits will include a &lt;code&gt;show&lt;/code&gt; function that will display the given dialog; for some kits, this will be a member function of a dialog object, while for others it will be a static class function.
In most cases, these functions will suspend the operation of your code at the point that they are called, while the dialog is run; they will then resume at the same point in your callback, and will return the results of the user's action (for example, by having a &lt;code&gt;ShowFileDialog&lt;/code&gt; func*999999999999999999999999999999+-=====tion return the file path the user picked as a string).

While this is simple in concept, and makes our code simple, the student should be aware that this is in fact a complex operation internally.
These functions have to start a second main loop to manage the application while the show function has blocked the original main loop.

== Introduction ==

Julia is a recent arrival to the world of programming languages, and has yet to accumulate a profusion of introductory texts. This will surely change. Soon we might see:

* Julia in 24 hours

* Learn Julia the Hard Way

* Julia for Dummies

* Julia for Fun and Profit

and many others. But until then, here’s a collection of notes and introductory paragraphs that comprise a gentle introduction to the Julia programming language, in the form of a wikibook.

The advantage and disadvantage of Wikibooks, apart from being free and open, is that anyone can edit anything at any time. In theory, a wikibook can only get better as more people add improvements and corrections. In practice, a wikibook may lose focus and consistency as it gains accuracy and coverage. But, because the Julia community has established a good ethos of encouraging participation in the development of the language, it's right that this wikibook is freely editable by everyone.

The [http://docs.julialang.org/en/release-0.3/ official Julia documentation] is excellent, although aimed more at the early adopters, developers, and more experienced programmers. Refer to it as often as possible.

Much of the text in this wikibook should work with the current version of Julia, which is, as of September 2014, version 0.3.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background ==
=== What is end-stage renal disease? ===
End-stage renal disease (ESRD), also known as Stage 5 renal disease, is a classification of kidney dysfunction in which the individual must undertake external filtering and cleansing of the blood via hemodialysis for a period of greater than three months. It is the most severe form of kidney disease as without hemodialysis treatment the kidneys would be unable to adequately sustain life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bellamo&quot;&gt; Bellamo, R et al. (2004). Acute renal failure – definition, outcome measures, animal models, fluid therapy and information technology needs: the Second International Consensus Conference of the Acute Dialysis Quality Initiative (ADQI) Group. Critical Care. Vol 8. Pp 204-212.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Hemodialysis-en.svg|thumb|Hemodialysis treatment mechanism]]
=== What are the causes of end-stage renal disease? ===
There are three primary causes of ESRD. They are as follows:
* '''Diabetes''' - without the action of insulin to regulate blood sugar levels, large volumes of blood sugar can accumulate in the kidneys and damage the blood-filtering capillaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ausgov&quot;&gt; Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Authoritative information and statistics to promote better health and wellbeing (2013). Australian Government.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Glomerulonephritis''' - inflammation of the glomerulus reduces their proficiency in filtering waste products and excess fluids from the blood leading to impaired kidney function.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ausgov&quot; /&gt;
* '''Hypertension''' - the reduction in blood supply to the kidneys due to thickening of the capillary walls and narrowing of the vessel diameter compromises their ability to function optimally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ausgov&quot; /&gt;
=== Effects associated with end-stage renal disease ===
* Cachexia (atrophy of '''skeletal''' muscle and other tissue);&lt;ref name=&quot;Knap&quot;&gt;Knap, B et al. (2005). Regular Exercise as a Part of Treatment for Patients With End-stage Renal Disease. Therapeutic Apheresis and Dialysis. Vol 9. Pp 211-213.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Secondary anemia (red blood cell deficiency);&lt;ref name=&quot;Knap&quot; /&gt;
* Depression;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kouidi&quot;&gt; Kouidi, E et al. (1998). The effects of exercise training on muscle atrophy in haemodialysis patients. Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation. Vol 13. Pp 685-699.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cardiac abnormalitites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kouidi&quot; /&gt;

== What is Resistance Exercise? ==
Resistance exercise involves the use of an external force or load to oppose movements made by the body. It is traditionally used to increase strength and size of skeletal muscles and is prescribed in a progressive-overload manner to ensure constant adaptations are being made.&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, J. (1995). Variable resistance exercise device. US 5409435 A.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Benefits of Resistance Exercise ==
Although hemodialysis is an essential treatment option for end-stage renal disease patients, it is often associated with decreased levels of physical fitness, psychosocial deficits and meagre quality of life.&lt;ref&gt;Deligiannis, A et al. (2002). EXERCISE TRAINING IN PATIENTS WITH END-STAGE RENAL DISEASE ON HEMODIALYSIS: COMPARISON OF THREE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS. Journal of Rehabilitation in Medicine. Vol 34. Pp 40-45.&lt;/ref&gt; Atrophy of skeletal muscle is a particularly adverse ramification of hemodialysis therapy as illustrated by its high correlation with mortality in the ESRD population. The prescription of resistance exercise may therefore be a beneficial intervention to oppose muscle wasting and promote longevity for ESRD patients.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheema&quot;&gt; Cheema, B et al. (2007). Progressive Exercise for Anabolism in Kidney Disease (PEAK): A Randomized, Controlled Trial of Resistance Training during Hemodialysis. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology. Vol 18. Pp 1594-1601.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proposed benefits of resistance exercise for ESRD patients include the following:
* Increases in muscle quality;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johansen&quot; /&gt;
* Increases in total strength;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johansen&quot; /&gt;
* Improvements in body weight and BMI (body mass index);&lt;ref name=&quot;Johansen&quot; /&gt;
* Improved physical function;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johansen&quot; /&gt;
* Enhanced vitality and quality of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johansen&quot;&gt;Johansen, K. (2007). Exercise in the End-Stage Renal Disease Population. Journal of the American Society of Nephrology. Vol 18. Pp 1845-1854.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Recommended Implementation ==
The justification for prescribing resistance exercise to counter muscle degeneration in the ESRD population is well established. There are however physical barriers which could potentially impede this. In particular the inactivity inherited as a result of spending 12 to 18 hours per week receiving hemodialysis treatments. It should be encouraged however that the sedentariness occurring during these periods be substituted with a tailored resistance exercise program to combat the accelerated muscle wasting process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheema&quot; /&gt; Current evidence suggests that physical activity levels of &gt;30 min/session three times/week are needed to elicit fitness and quality of life responses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smart&quot; /&gt; However given the diminished physical capacity ESRD patients exhibit, '''Exercise and Sports Science Australia (ESSA)''' specifically developed recommendations as to how these patients should proceed when commencing a resistance exercise program. They specifically advocate resistance exercise for individuals who exhibit cachectic qualities. They also advise that the activities included in the program are able to be performed in a seated position so as to allow the patient to exercise whilst undergoing dialysis. The patient must then complete the following screening tools:
:1. Thorough medical review including medical history, cardiovascular and blood pressure profiles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smart&quot; /&gt;
:2. Detailed medication history with information regarding potential biochemical, hematological and medication-exercise interactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smart&quot; /&gt;
:3. Cardiopulmonary evaluation by virtue of an ECG (electrocardiogram) to determine suitability for the program and individual necessities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smart&quot; /&gt; 
The following is ESSA's protocol for resistance exercise which can be administered upon satisfactory completion of the aforementioned screening tools:&lt;ref name=&quot;Smart&quot;&gt; Smart, N et al. (2013). Exercise &amp; Sports Science Australia (ESSA) position statement on exercise and chronic kidney disease. Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport. Vol 16. Pp 406-411.&lt;/ref&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

In summary, resistance exercise (if conducted appropriately) is a beneficial mode of physical activity in the ESRD population to resist the insidious process of muscle wasting and improve quality of life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Early 18th century German theatre is led by Johann Elias Schlegel (1719-1749), who wrote &quot;Der Triumph der guten Frauen&quot; (The triumph of good women, 1749).

==&quot;The triumph of good women&quot;==

&quot;The triumph of good women&quot;. Time: 1740s. Place: Germany. 

&quot;The triumph of good women&quot; text at ?

Nicander left his wife, Hilaire, ten years ago, to pursue other women, including Julie, wife of Agenor. To win him back, Hilaire disguises herself as a man and pretends to court Julie. Seeing Hilaire as a competitor, Nicander threatens the disguised man to a duel, but she refuses to fight. When Agenor arrives, he talks to his wife apart from Hilaire to rid himself of her presence. After Hilaire leaves, Agenor declares that since their marriage he is unhappy about her behavior. She is too flighty and does not regulate her conduct according to his wishes. He especially does not want her to attend a ball she wishes to go to. Julie unhappily submits. She asks the help of her servant, Catherine, to obtain money from her husband because of a debt incurred to Hilaire in a matter concerning her husband's honor. When Catherine asks Agenor for household money, he gives her some but not for that reason: to spy on his wife. He then kisses her but when she cries out, he is forced to desist. She is next accosted by Nicander, who readily admits loving both her and her mistress. To win Julie, though unconscious of what had just occurred, he requests Catherine to say that Agenor tried to seduce her while he works on his friend's jealousy by speaking against Hilaire. Instead of keeping the money, Catherine gives it to her mistress, specifying that it is a gift Agenor does not want to hear mentioned. But when Agenor sees Julie with a happier demeanor than usual, he becomes suspicious and insists on knowing why. She admits it is because of the gift. He counters that it is not a gift of his but from one of her admirers. Convinced of his honesty, Agenor encourages Nicander to remind Julie of her duties towards her husband. Instead, Nicander encourages Julie to betray her husband and thereby get the upper hand on him. She declines and intends to speak to her husband against him. But when she hears her husband speaking heatedly with Catherine, she decides to spy on them, thereby discovering how the money was obtained and Agenor's desire to seduce their servant. When Julie comes out of hiding, Catherine quickly realizes she has heard everything and reveals this to Hilaire, who considers the matter of small importance but yet encourages Julie to avenge herself by betraying her husband. She refuses. Meanwhile, Nicander is pursued by creditors, but, to his surprise, is saved from debtor's prison by Hilaire. Feeling grateful towards his new-found friend, Nicander reveals to Hilaire what she already knows, that he is married to a woman named Hilaire. Because Catherine refuses to cooperate with his designs, Agenor fires her and justifies the action to Julie by saying it is because she carries gifts from her admirers. But Julie reveals she overheard his conversation with their servant and knows of his attempt at seducing her. Nevertheless, Agenor is adamant. To aid Julie's plight and promote Hilaire's pretended love-interest, Nicander proposes that Hilaire disguise herself as her new-found servant. Instead, Hilaire presents herself to Nicander as her own sister but still disguised in such a way that he does not recognize his own wife, though charmed by her manners and conversation in such a way as to seem to fall in love with her a second time. As a favor, Hilaire requests him to obtain letters from her banker, to which he agrees. When Julie enters, Hilaire presents herself as her disguised male friend. Julie turns away Catherine's replacement and now fears her husband's reaction. Hilaire proposes to take her away from him. &quot;I fear much less my husband: he works merely against my peace, while you work against my virtue,&quot; she answers. Agenor suddenly enters and, finding Hilaire at his wife's feet, threatens to kill him. To his astonishment, Hilaire reveals her true sex. When Nicander returns, she then reveals she is his estranged wife. Touched at her persistence in trying to win him back, he readily agrees to return to her while an abashed Agenor promises to amend his domestic tyranny.</text>

Hi, I would like to operate this bot for automatic archiving of discussion pages. The bot will need to be flagged, otherwise it will have to poke people unnecesarily.  [[User:MiszaBot]], the original bot for the task, appears to have been dysfunctional globally since late March. I am willing to take over the task if there is interest in the community.  I have been doing [[m:Meta:Requests for bot status/ArchiverBot|the same for Meta since April]]. The function had been [[Special:WhatLinksHere/User:MiszaBot/config|used]] on pages like [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Projects]].

I see that the Reading Room pages and some others use &quot;keys&quot; in their configurations - these will have to be updated and I'm willing to do that once approved. [[User:Whym|Whym]] ([[User talk:Whym|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Whym|contribs]]) 14:11, 13 June 2014 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol question.svg|15px]] '''Question: ''' I understand ArchiverBot uses the Pywikibot framework just like MiszaBot did. What do you mean by &quot;keys&quot; will need to be updated? I think for transparency sakes, the community should know what to expect before approving the bot. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:13, 13 June 2014 (UTC)
::[[User:Darklama|Darklama]], a correct &quot;key&quot; value written in the template will permit the bot to archive when the archive is not a subpage of the discussion page. [//git.wikimedia.org/blob/pywikibot%2Fcore.git/ba530041c847232e39ae8dc457ac67f329bb1c6e/scripts%2Farchivebot.py#L52]  It is a hash value calculated from the current page name and a &quot;salt&quot; value specified by the operator; I don't know what was the salt value used by MiszaBot, and will need to use a new value. Alternatively, I could enforce the bot to perform archiving no matter where the archive page is, though. [[User:Whym|Whym]] ([[User talk:Whym|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Whym|contribs]]) 22:56, 13 June 2014 (UTC)

#[[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] '''Support''' Since MiszaBot stopped working and this bot can take its place. I also support dropping the bot flag for MiszaBot since it doesn't need it any more. Whym should update keys to allow archives to continue to be placed in their current location after ArchiverBot has received the bot flag. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 11:42, 14 June 2014 (UTC)

#{{oppose}} Would appreciate a more detailed discussion regarding the continual archiving automation process (what pages are included, since it never took place) before granting it the flag. I have standing objections to several Discussion Rooms talk pages being archived without validated conclusions. Not that I have a problem with [[User:Whym|Whym]] running a bot for this, it is just a good place to prompt the addressing of the issue before resuming the silent obfuscation.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 05:34, 15 June 2014 (UTC)
#: Hi [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]], I think the issue you raised is addressed page-by-page. I'd suggest anyone is free to change the settings anytime (with a good reason, of course). Here is the full list of the pages from [[Special:WhatLinksHere/User:MiszaBot/config]] (user talk pages excluded): &lt;div class=&quot;toccolours mw-collapsible mw-collapsed&quot; style=&quot;width:400px&quot;&gt;
#:*[[Talk:Wikijunior]]
#:*[[Talk:Main Page]]
#:*[[Cookbook talk:Table of Contents]]
#:*[[Wikibooks:Reading room/General]]
#:*[[Wikibooks:Reading room/Projects]]
#:*[[Wikibooks:Reading room/Technical Assistance]]
#:*[[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance]]
#:*[[Wikibooks:Requests for import]]
#:*[[Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance]]
#:*[[Wikibooks:Reading room/Proposals]]
#:*[[Wikibooks:Requests for renaming]]&lt;/div&gt;
#: For example, you can edit [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General]] and change &quot;minthreadsleft = 1&quot; to &quot;minthreadsleft = 4&quot;, the bot will keep at least 4 newest threads even if they are 3 months old or older.  When there is disagreement, a common practice is to use a more conservative setting, and wait and see how the log grows, I'd say. [[User:Whym|Whym]] ([[User talk:Whym|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Whym|contribs]]) 13:51, 17 June 2014 (UTC)
#::: Thanks, can you please copy and extend some of what you wrote above and add it to the bot's page with other pertinent links for the community. I also think that the pages would benefit from a simple visual indication that they are automatically archived. But my main concern is the present configuration, in this case since you will be responsible for the task I would ask you if you are happy with the setting, what would you like to change and are there other pages you see that would benefit from the bot's action ?
#::: My opposition concerns any forum where a thread is initiated and requires a conclusion and someone to be responsible for the closing of the issue. From Proposal to any of the Assistance pages I don't think that those should be automated, in fact closing those topics are part of the administrative tasks of the project and most of the time we suffer by the silent automatic achievement that has been occurring.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:27, 17 June 2014 (UTC)
#::::There has also been no prior consensus or detailed discussion requiring that a conclusion be made/reached, issues be closed, and someone is to be responsible for that for reading room discussions. However people have discussed and as a result extended the length of time required before an inactive discussion is archived. From 7 days to 21 days, and most recently 50 days for the reading rooms. I think the proposals reading room is a better place to debate archiving of the reading rooms. I think RFP is the wrong place to debate what pages should or shouldn't be archived by bots and what settings to use for individual pages. This bot can also be used to archive people's user talk pages as they see fit, and that in itself is sufficient need for the bot flag. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:37, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
#:::::I can object to running a bot that performs a task I disagree with making this is the proper place to express what I object and see it addressed. 
#:::::I don't know what people participated or how they reached that time extension for the reading rooms (I would have participated if aware). This type of issue should be stated with the one that is to run the archival bot (the one responsible for the task) and so this is a good place to centralize the information about the subject for the rest of the community.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 17:44, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
#::::::I can also object to objections that I disagree with. I can also suggest alternatives or solutions. I understand the objection to be only relevant to specific pages or specific archive settings of specific pages, rather then as an objection to the bot archiving pages in general. I disagree with your objections, because they are page-specific objections which are not relevant to the bot archiving pages in general. I think page-specific objections to archiving should be discussed where most people that would be effected by any changes in archiving would reasonable expect such a discussion to take place, which for the reading rooms would be the proposals reading room. I object to whether the bot gets the flag or not depending on page-specific objections being addressed first, as it isn't relevant to the bot archiving other pages, and getting the flag to avoid flooding recent changes while it archives other pages. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:33, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
#:::::::No one said you can't disagree with my objections, in fact you are the one pointing that this is not the place to state my objection not the other way around. In any case I fail to see you suggesting any alternatives or solutions besides a reference to some talk (that I, and probably more aren't aware regarding a extension of time for archival, that to me is born from the deeper problem I'm again pointing at) and so in regards to the relevancy you fail to notice that it affects 50% of the pages that would be silently and automatically archived. Your objection to my objections are noticed but I fail to see you addressing them beyond attempting to dismiss them in this discussion...
#:::::::My opposition stands while safeguards or an rational explanation is not provided in regards to why for instance the RfD is excluded from automatic  archival but not the Requests for renaming (not to mention graver problems like the silent archival of discussion in the areas of Proposals and administrative action that results in inconclusive outcomes and fosters inaction by the administrative body).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 19:36, 18 June 2014 (UTC)
#::::::::Each page is configured for auto-archive behavior separately.  If you think Requests for renaming shouldn't be automatically archived, that's a topic for discussion &amp;mdash; quite separate from whether it should be impossible for ''any'' page on the project to be automatically archived.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 04:34, 19 June 2014 (UTC)
#:::::::::I think that Panic is making a very good point.  Is there any way that a concluded conversation can be highlighted as having concluded so the bot knows which bits can be archived and which can't?  A simple ''tick'' template could be added when a discussion is finished and then only those discussions could be archived?  A few months ago I changed the settings for most of the Reading rooms - the original setting was to archive after 30 days but I increased it to 50 or 60 days.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_the_Isle_of_Mann.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:06, 19 June 2014 (UTC)
#:{{outdent|::::::::}}
#: Fwiw, I recall a time or two seeing a thread blocked from archiving by embedding a future timestamp in it.  This tended to happen by accident, but was occasionally deliberate.  Either way, it could be difficult to undo because one had to find the trick timestamp.  And when used deliberately it sometimes got folks rather annoyed.  Of course whether it would even work depends on the algorithm used by the bot.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 02:21, 20 June 2014 (UTC)
#:: @[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]], [[User:Panic2k4|Panic]]: [[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] is correct. Please see [[mw:Manual:Pywikibot/archivebot.py/setup]], which I have linked on the bot's user page, for ways to block the bot from archiving particular sections. You might also want to ask [[c:User:Euku|Euku]] to run [[c:User:SpBot]]. It specifically archives sections marked by human as resolved. [[User:Whym|Whym]] ([[User talk:Whym|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Whym|contribs]]) 04:20, 22 June 2014 (UTC)
#::::Yes, in regards to the time stamp &quot;feature&quot;, but that does not address my initial concerns that automation will act (resume acting) silently in pages that really do not require or benefit from automatic archival. In any case I don't see it able to work as Xania indicated (it is an exclusion/delay from automation) not as to &quot;specifically archives sections marked by human as resolved&quot; (for example like the RfDs).
#::::I have no issue in regards to the bot working under you or its general functioning (that was not the intention here, this is an objection to resuming the silent archival of some pages), in fact I would change my vote to support if you accept to exclude some of the problem pages from the bot's function until we reach a detailed consensus regarding what purpose the automatic archival of those pages serves (mostly those that require communal/administrative agreed/formal resolution or conclusions).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 21:45, 22 June 2014 (UTC)  
#:::::[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]], would you want to edit and remove the template &lt;nowiki&gt;{{User:MiszaBot/config}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; from whatever page as you see necessity? I agree in that on certain pages sections are indefinitely waiting for resolutions.  However, because I don't regularly participate in discussions on English Wikibooks, I cannot confidently identify which pages should be treated as such.  An operator has no special power over it - it's decided on-wiki by the community. [[User:Whym|Whym]] ([[User talk:Whym|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Whym|contribs]]) 14:08, 25 June 2014 (UTC)
#::::::Well we seem to be in agreement on the necessity of a communal consensus so even if so far no one made opposition to my objections (only the locale) I agree with the previous view that granting you the flag would result in a substitution of MiszaBot I see no point or necessity to edit MiszaBot's config as to progress forward on this request. We also should start a request for the removal of MiszaBot's flag as the consensus seems to be that only one should be active (haven't noticed anyone opposing that).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:03, 26 June 2014 (UTC)

#{{comment}} Any remaining issue to solve before the flag can be granted?  FWIW, here is a log that shows what the bot will do in the first run: [http://tools.wmflabs.org/archiving/enwb.txt] (temporary link, I might delete it at some point). As the log shows, Reading rooms wouldn't be archived until I issue new keys.  I wouldn't start working on them at least until confirming it works fine for the other pages.

It is not so simple, as in 1/p case,  to compute orbit portrait&lt;ref&gt;[[w:orbit portrait|wikipedia : orbit portrait]]&lt;/ref&gt; of parabolic fixed point.

Algorithm :
* choose child period p
* compute internal angle ( rational number) = n/p ( where n&lt;p and n/p is ... ( to do ))
* compute denominator of external angle = &lt;math&gt;2^p-1&lt;/math&gt;
* find parameter rays that land on the root point which is on the boundary of main cardioid : 
** compute all pairs for periods 1-p
** remove pairs which land not on the main cardioid ( inside &lt; 1/3; 2/3 &gt; [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Wake|wake]] )
** compute pairs of external angles which are not inside pairs of lower periods (see image on the right )
** choose n-th pair  of angles which land on the root point
* switch to dynamic plane : use one angle from pair of parameter rays ( rays with the same angles land on the parabolic fixed point) to compute orbit portrait of parabolic fixed point

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Mobile Phones=

==Fashion phones==


Fashion phones are phones that have a unique design but don't really have a lot of features on them. They may not be able to do most things that smart phones do but they would benefit someone who just wants a phone that looks good with a sleek design. On fashion phones the keypad might have a funky design or if its a slide phone it may slide out in a different way to a normal slide phone and the phone would be small and thin whereas some smart phones would have a larger design.

==Multi-functional phones==

these are combine both style and business features, appealing to the mass market rather than a niche. they have the best of both worlds: high spec features, large amounts of storage, high speed processing, slim design with touch screens and access to the Internet

==Mobile phone safety advice==

When thinking about a mobile phone there are many things to consider these include:

*'''Cost'''
A child can lose a mobile phone more than once; this will cost a fortune for the parents Mobile phones also contain harmful chemicals which can be dangerous if not disposed of properly and to dispose of these properly will cost money also this will cause a problem for the environment . A child will also want to keep up with the latest fashion causing them to change pones and phones tend to get more and more expensive.

*'''Crime'''
Police officers have come up with an idea to reduce the theft of mobile phone. This started of in the Colwyn Bay area the idea involves attaching the phones with the ultraviolet (UV) pen so that when stolen the phone can be easily detected. Mobile phones are stolen every 3 minutes so this would really help a person worried about theft.

*'''Peace of mind'''

Parents need to know where their child is and how they are. Having a mobile phone can help this situation. If a child has to be somewhere after school the parents wouldn’t know which will get them worried and think of the worst things but if the child carries a mobile phone the parents would have peace on their minds.

*'''Invasion of privacy'''

Privacy can also be an issue when it comes to mobile networks because the user can easily me hacked and their private things can be messed with mobile payment is also a problem when it comes to privacy.

*'''Environmental cost'''

It may not cost as much to go through the making of a mobile phone but when it comes to the disposal phase that’s when the environment is at stake, mobile phones contains dangerous chemicals of not disposed of properly. Heavy metals such as mercury, lead and cadmium which are found especially in old mobile phones can be harmful. Problems begin if the handsets end up in landfill sites or if they are dumped illegally because this could lead to toxic substances seeping into the soil and groundwater.


In conclusion i believe that when buying a mobile phone the main things to consider are;
weight, function and cost.

==Difficulties using mobile phones==
There are many difficulties using mobile phones, especially when elders are trying to use them. Some elders have hearing problems therefore they may not be able to hear the other person on the other line.

Other problems also apply to everyone such as the keyboard may be too small/too big, therefore using the keyboard to get to certain applications on the handset may be difficult.

Most people also find it hard getting around the handset to find certain applications or pieces of data.  

When some people want to see the last calls they had made they find it difficult to find their way around also when they want to send a text message they may not know where the certain application is for creating text/ or maybe the keyboard for the handset maybe too big or too small.

==Advantages of using mobile phones==
It is for a fact that having a mobile phone nowadays is a sort of a necessity and it is an inevitable truth that mobile industry is taking everyone by a storm. From the very basic thing of making a call to texting, and now Internet access for just a touch of your finger tips. Do you have one of these? or do you know somebody who enjoys having such stuff? I do have one of those too and I wont deny the fact that I enjoys using them. So as one of the million subscriber of this technology I will share you some of the advantages and disadvantages I found, out of having a mobile phone.

First here are some advantages of having it:

*It keeps you in constant contact with people you consider important 
*It can help you seek help immediately during emergency cases 
*It's a sense of being financially uplifted. 
*Through mobile phones you can lessen your boredom,example listen to your favorite music and as well as watching movies through downloading. 
*It can take photos 
*Mobile phones also gives us easier access on the Internet
*You can carry it anywhere 
*It has a lot of useful functions like calendar, making notes, alarm clock, timer and calculator.

No doubt, our mobile phones makes our lives more convenient, but as the saying goes every technology has it's equal negative side and mobile phones are not so special to be exempted. Here are some disadvantages of having one: 
*Expensive 
*People spend less time bonding with there family and friends 
*People just contact through phone and became too lazy meeting outside 
*Disturb us on our works and studies 
*People spend lots and lots of money buying the latest model 
*May have a physiological effect because of radiation it produces 
*Easily broken 
*mobile phone makes it easier to invade privacy

In the end, it is up to the end user to weigh the advantages and the disadvantages of responsible mobile phone use.

==Worms==
A computer worm is a self-replicating malware computer program. It uses a computer network to send copies of itself to other computers and it may do so automatically. This is due to security shortcomings on the target computer. Unlike a virus, it does not need to attach itself to an existing program. Worms almost always cause at least some harm to the network, even if only by consuming bandwidth, whereas viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer. Worms can replicate in great volume. For example, a worm can send out copies of itself to every contact in your e-mail address book, and then it can send itself to all of the contacts your contact's e-mail address books.

Some of the ways to prevent worms are:
*Use a fire wall
*Use antivirus software

You should always keep antivirus software up to date as new worms and malware are created regularly so require the antivirus software to be updated as well.

==Viruses==

Computer viruses are small software programs that are designed to spread from one computer to another and to interfere with computer operation.  A virus might corrupt or delete data on your computer, use your e-mail program to spread itself to other computers, or even erase everything on your hard disk. 

What can a computer Virus do to your computer?

*Your computer runs more slowly than normal
*Your computer stops responding or locks up often
*Your computer crashes and restarts every few minutes
*Your computer restarts on its own and then fails to run normally
*Applications on your computer don't work correctly
*Disks or disk drives are inaccessible
*You can't print correctly
*You see unusual error messages
*You see distorted menus and dialog boxes

==Spyware==

What is a Spyware?

Spyware is a category of computer programs that attach themselves to your operating system in nefarious ways. They can suck the life out of your computer's processing power. 

What can a spyware do to your computer?

Other kinds of spyware make changes to your computer that can be annoying and can cause your computer slow down or crash.

==Implications of Technology==

==Economics Implications==
====Cultural Implication====
The cultural impact on technology is not something new to be found. Technology has been used in many ways i.e. to create new things.

We all underestimate the influence of technology on culture,this problem arises when we are thinking of the relationship between culture and technology. 

Technology exists within the cultural boundary.

Culture runs the technology, as well as producing its applications, cultural forces can limit as well as remove the practical applications of technology, this may be due to societal predispositions.

Because of culture and technology are extremely intertwined, we must also think about religious, governmental,demographic and ethical influences as this can have serious cultural implications on technology.

====Social Implications====

There are many social implications of technology, some examples are:
*'''virtual gaming'''
*'''social networking site'''
*'''mobile phones'''

'''Social networks'''
Sites like Facebook have changed the way we socialize dramatically, they enable friends globally to organize events, share pictures and much more
 
'''Mobile Phones'''
*20 years ago mobile phones were used only by businessmen, but today just about everybody has one. This has lead to a big social change, friends can organize social events from anywhere at anytime. Also mobile phones mean that friends globally can keep in touch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Factors Related to Inputs ==
=== Access to Labour ===
'''Related industry type''': Labour-oriented industry, labour-intensive industry
* Suburbs have better access to quality labour.
* Labour-intensive industries - Industrial areas near residential ones have access to a large amount of labour.

=== Access to Raw Materials ===
'''Related industry type''': Raw material-oriented industry
* Industries for which raw materials are important include metal refining, etc.

=== Access to Power ===
'''Related industry type''': Power-oriented industry
Industries that need a huge amount of energy for daily operations tend to be located near to the source of energy to reduce energy loss and leakage during transport and reduce costs. Coal, in particular, is heavy and bulky and thus coal-based industries tend to locate near power sources. Oil and natural gases can be transported by oil tankers and pipelines. Other sources of electricity may be transported through power lines or even the electricity grid.

== Factors Related to Markets ==

=== Proximity to Markets ===
'''Related industry type''': Market-oriented industry
Industries that tend to be located near markets include:
* Perishable products, e.g. fresh food
* Fragile products, e.g. expensive vases
* Timely products that go out of date quickly, e.g. newspapers
* Heavy and bulky products, e.g. iron and coal

The significance of market depends on:
* Individual demand of consumers (incl. their purchasing power)
* Number of consumers

=== Proximity to Clients ===
Some industries need to be close to the clients to meet their needs individually, e.g. property agencies and insurance companies.

=== Proximity to Suppliers ===
Some industries need close connections with suppliers to tell them their needs, e.g. fashion outlets.

=== Access to Management ===
Some industries need efficient management to run effectively. Functions of management including:
* Planning production methods and locations
* Organising workers and assigning posts
* Coordinating various departments in the firm
* Monitoring other departments
* Formulating strategies, such as expansion, integration or changing plant location

== Inputs vs. Markets: Which is more important? ==
* '''Procurement costs''' are the costs of transporting inputs (raw materials and power) to the plant.
*'''Distribution costs''' are the costs of distributing final outputs to the markets.

*When procurement costs exceed distribution costs, the firm is raw-material- or power-oriented.
*When distribution costs exceed procurement costs, the firm is market-oriented.

*In general, '''weight-gaining industries''' such as processing are raw-material or power-oriented because procurement costs exceed distribution costs. (e.g. sugar cane, iron and steel, copper smelting...)
*In general, '''weight-losing industries''' such as assembly are market-oriented because distribution costs exceed procurement costs. (e.g. car manufacturing...)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Computing is fundamentally about information processes. On a digital computer such processes are carried out via symbol manipulations in binary logic. With the advancement in semiconducting technology we have been able to keep making computers run faster -- manipulate bits at a higher speed -- by cramming more transistors into computer chips. This is known as the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law Moore's law] originated around 1970's. The trend of increase has slowed down and will eventually flatten due to limits in physics as predicted by some [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bm6ScvNygUU physicist], who also predicted potential new technologies that may replace semiconductors (silicon) in computer hardware manufacturing.

In the meantime, hardware companies have tweaked their technologies to maintain the growth in hardware capacity. Multicore technology replaces one fast CPU ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_processing_unit Central Processing Unit] -- the brain of a computer) with many slower ones (called cores) to avoid overheating the chip. Even though each core is a slower but we get more of them and could get more done if we can arrange the work properly. For instance, a strong worker can lift 100 bricks a minute and a normal worker can only lift 34 bricks. Three normal workers can outperform one strong worker even though they are much slower individually. This is the idea of parallel processing. 

Traditionally computer program has been written to describe sequential processes, which means the steps can only be carried out one at a time and one after another in a sequence. This type of program works fine on a computer with a single processor because the computer can perform one symbol manipulation at a time any ways. In fact we have been reaping the benefit of Moore's law: every two computer hardware double it speed causing our program run twice as fast without us doing anything. This trend has stopped. Each individual processor (core) is not getting faster but we have more of them in a computer. As a result our existing sequential program will run slower even though the hardware's capacity has become larger. Before the next generation of computers are invented we can [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_computing parallel computing/processing] to solve problems faster computationally. 

The idea of parallel processing is not new. For example, a car assembly line allows multiple cars to be built at the same time. Even though different parts of the car are being assembled at a given time this assembly line keeps all the workers busy increasing the throughput (number of cars built per unit time) of the whole system. We can make the workers work faster to further increase the throughput or we could add another assembly and hire more workers. This is one form of parallel processing - pipelining. Another form of parallelism divides the whole computing task into parts that can be computed simultaneously and run them physically on different CPU (computers). This is similar to putting a jigsaw puzzle together with friends. As you can imagine having some extra help will definitely help solve the puzzle faster, but do it mean the more the better. The answer is no. As the number of helpers increase the amount of coordination and communication increases faster. When you have too many people they may start stepping on each other's toes and competing with each other for resources (space and puzzle pieces). This is known as the overhead of parallel processing, which causes the diminishing return on investment. We can see this pattern clearly when we measure the improvement in performance as a function of the workers involved.

In the context of parallel processing/computing we use a metric called [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedup speedup] to measure the improvement in performance. The achieved speedup equals the solution/execution time of a program with out parallel processing divided by the execution time of the same task with parallel processing.

:&lt;math&gt;S = \frac{T_{old}}{T_{new}}&lt;/math&gt;
'''where:'''
*&lt;math&gt;S \ &lt;/math&gt; is the speedup.
*&lt;math&gt;T_{old} \ &lt;/math&gt; is the old execution time without the parallel processing.
*&lt;math&gt;T_{new} \ &lt;/math&gt; is the new execution time with the parallel processing.

If parallel processing makes a program run twice as fast the speedup is two (a.k.a two-fold speedup). Theoretically as we double the number of workers or resources we can expect a two-fold speed up. Practically it is hard to achieve this optimal speedup because some tasks are not always parallelizable. For example you can not usually lay the carpet before the floor of house is constructed and you cannot always add more painters to get the painting job down faster. Computational tasks often have similar dependency and resources constraints to keep us from fully utilize the parallel processing systems (e.g. multi-core computers) we have.

Exercise:

With a washing machine and a dryer you could work on one load of laundry at time. You wash it first and then put it into the dryer. Assume the whole task takes an hour. This works perfectly when you have only one load to do and there is nothing you can do to make it go faster. What if you have many loads of laundry to do? You can at least at one load done every hour. Can you &quot;speed it up&quot;? If the number of loads can be arbitrary larger what is shortest average per load laundry time you can achieve?</text>

;Purpose and usage
This page simplifies discussing book project categories by providing a short link by name only and a pretty-print output which can be controlled without long distracting direct links in prose that needs constructed and proofed.
* It forms the simple link: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:{{{1}}} |{{{1}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; sans any other parameters.
&amp;nbsp;
* Define the parameter ''''F'''' anything to prefix 'Category' in front of the prettied up name, which as shown above, will otherwise appear just as the bare Title of the category name, which is the controlling pass parameter (i.e. &lt;nowiki&gt;|1 or {{{1}}} &lt;/nowiki&gt;).
&amp;nbsp;
* Define the second placeholder parameter '''&lt;nowiki&gt;|2 ({{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' or ''''2' )''' to display different hyperlinked text as desired. {{indent|5}}When both ''''F'''' and ''''2'''' are defined, ''''2'''' overrides and has precedence.

* The first parameter is the text inside the box. If the box also contains template calls, you might need to express this as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt; | 1= &lt;/nowiki&gt;''some text'' &lt;/code&gt; 
* '''image''' (optional) : the image to be used.
**Adapted from {{Tlx|textBox}} but totally rewritten since in table form as a more robust template with default formatting.
;Some optional parameters that can be adjusted: '''Note:''' most should be left as is, unless using the template as a sub-template as {{tl|TRS-warning}} did with this. &lt;br/&gt;'''Note as well:''' this is a double table wrapper around inner table with image and text areas, and these parameters below do not give you full control!

# BG2 - (background,  #dfdfdf), of the Framing Table, defaults to a light blue-grey 
# CLR - defaults to clear:left
# FLT - float: left is default
# M&amp;nbsp; - margin: 0px 2px of the inner table text box, different margin from the following.

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/OpSys/{{{3}}}/{{{1}}} | {{{2}}}]], pipe-linked as {{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: if and when given, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}/&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;u&gt;MUST HAVE&lt;/u&gt; a trailing '/' to form a proper link.
&amp;nbsp;
The observant and discerning reader will have noted the ''''| p='''' for'' 'pretty parameter' ''overrides ''''2'''', as it does for most all {{lc|Trainz link templates}}. 
&amp;nbsp;
'''&lt;u&gt;Example-1, expanded paste down&lt;/u&gt;:'''
:This is because all template default parameters, formally 'numbered parameters' can also be specified like this:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TA
 |1=Tips And Tricks
 |2=Tips
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 which ''in wiki-markup language'' is processed exactly
 the same as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TOS |Tips And Tricks |Tips }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
&amp;nbsp;
{{TRS-warning|other=&lt;small&gt;caution|
When using a template such as this which forms a link, it is best to NOT use spaces between the pipe characters &quot;{{!}}&quot; as done for clarity above.&lt;/small&gt;}}
{{TrainzTip|'''However...''' ''Spaces in the 'pretty-text' part are fine and dandy!'' Indulge yourself in clarity!
}}
'''&lt;u&gt;In-line Examples&lt;/u&gt;:'''
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TOS|Tips And Tricks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; links as: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/OpSys/Tips And Tricks|Tips And Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the other formulation: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/OpSys/Tips And Tricks|Tips And Tricks]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; both would.
:But... is much easier to edit around on a page when trying to get the best prose presentation.

* Similarly: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TOS|Tips And Tricks|Tricks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; links as if the constructs: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/OpSys/Tips And Tricks|Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/OpSys/Tips And Tricks|Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is perhaps part of the phrase you want.
Which do you think is easiest to look past in a paragraph filled with prose and multiple links?
&amp;nbsp;
* Sub-subpage links will mainly be needed in the forthcoming page-threaded series of tutorials such as the Programmed Instruction (Trainz A-Z) linked progressive skills building tutorials off their own sub-TOC base page. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The following should be included the written Case Study Report:

* Summary 
* Annotated List of Actors
* Timeline of Events
* Maps of Locations 
* Clear Identification of Policy Issues
* Narrative of the Case
* Discussion Questions 
* Complete References of Cited (primary and secondary) Documents (with hyperlinks as appropriate)

The report should be written from a Neutral Point-of-View. Online encyclopedias are not acceptable sources for citation (feel free to read to get background information, but they are at best tertiary sources).

The report should be on the order of 3000-5000 words. It should be fully referenced. Additional readings on the order of 30 -100 pages  should be assigned with the case, these will be linked on the case web page or handed out in class.

Do not copy material you find on the Internet - copyright violations will be deleted and you may be blocked from editing again.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Since most of the foods here are pretty healthy, I don't think hot dog fits here. It might make kids make a connection between hot dogs and healthy foods. I know that hot dogs CAN be healthy, it's just that they generally are made from &quot;mystery meat&quot; and lots of preservatives. Perhaps hazelnut, hawthorn, or hackberry could be used instead?

&lt;!-- Please add categories to the bottom of this page, and add interwikis to Wikidata. --&gt;
== Usage ==
;Purpose and usage
;This template asserts the above message as the default 'middle mode' and has two others. It always
:auto-categorizes a page to the hidden auto-categories:
# [[:category:Trainz pages needing attention ]]
# [[:Category:Trainz new pages underconstruction ]] '''Or conditionally:''' {{nowrap|[[:Category:Trainz new linked pages to-be-constructed]]}} 
&lt;big&gt;'''The three modes can be classified as:&quot;'&lt;/big&gt;
# This page is really a dream (NEW=1), but has been linked to as a page requiring future development
# This page has been begun, but has warts and omissions, and is not quite far enough along to call a stub page. 
## Somewhere about 30-50% with stubbed in sections, a page can be reclassified as a stub.
## If about or over 75-80% complete, only retain in-line {{Tl|TRS-sect-stub}} templates
# This is a dated page (REV=1), which has been tagged for OVERHAUL. It displays a message accordingly.
----
The look of these template uses is shown below. {{BL|It will always calculate the time since the page was last edited and display it with boilerplate and several text insertion options:}}
&amp;nbsp;
==Template's modes==

&amp;nbsp;
* The placeholder parameter ''''1'''' may be defined to alter the upper message line with a bit about the work in progress. This is particularly useful when the template is used to allocate new pages with very little on them, planned pages in other words. It also manifests in Older Overhaul messages in the same relative place when the below parameter is defined.
===Add text in default mode===
Passsing the following text (with some additional formatting for color:
:&lt;code&gt;on the WXYZ Trainz topic and it's complications. (This is where an argument passed as '1' is displayed.) &lt;/code&gt; 
{{TTip|Note this same string is used below as a pass value, but DOES NOT manifest, keep that difference in mind.}}

{{TRS-underconstruction|inhibit=1|1={{col| on the WXYZ Trainz topic and it's complications.|#0F0F0F}} (This is where an argument passed as '1' is displayed.) &lt;br/&gt;Note how the text should lead into the boilerplate of the timestamp message...}}
&amp;nbsp;

===Add text in NEW topic page mode===
* The named parameter ''''NEW'''' bypasses (ignores) ''anything passed in'' as the ''''1'''' parameter, and alters the message boilerplate to show the page has been earmarked (and is currently a  pre-stub pre-underconstruction placeholder page title) but displays the definition of NEW which is syntaxed with other boilerplate text to allow a list or outline of what the page will hold. 
:* Use the |1= {{TN|define}} to ready text more suitable for a later change of status, after the page has been started for real.
:* The ''''LINK'''' named parameter manifests ''ONLY IN NEW mode'', and is meant to take a {{lc|Trainz link templates|Trainz Link Template}} as a pass parameter to display said hyperlink and will in it's turn, somewhat modify the standard boilerplate of the NEW message, inserting glue text to mention the current page has been linked to as a reference on another page.{{BullR
}}This of course aids and helps in integrating the topics and their respective coverages.
&amp;nbsp;
Passing the following strings, (one disappears):
&lt;pre&gt;
|1= on the WXYZ Trainz topic and it's complications. (This is where an argument
 passed as '1' is displayed.) 
| NEW= This page has been allocated and is not yet begun...
| LINK= [[Trainz/CMP|Content Manager PLUS]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{TRS-underconstruction|inhibit=1|NEW= This page has been allocated and is not yet begun...|LINK={{TL|CMP|Content Manager PLUS}}|1={{col| on the WXYZ Trainz topic and it's complications.|#0F0F0F}} (This is where an argument passed as '1' is displayed.) &lt;br/&gt;Note how the text should lead into the boilerplate of the timestamp message...}}

&amp;nbsp;
===Add text in Remodeling mode===
* The named parameter ''''REV'''' (&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{REV|}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;) acts as a control switch to change the lede message from that shown above to {{BL|one more suitable to overhauling an older and dated page.}}
:* As with the default mode above ''''1'''' can be defined to refine the boilerplate message displayed with a bit about the work planned or under way. 
&amp;nbsp;
The Overhaul box mode displayed boilerplate says:
{{LeftBox|'''This older [[Trainz|Trainz Wikibooks]] topic page''' is undergoing an Overhaul &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#if:{{{1|}}}|{{{1}}}|&lt;br/&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; (shows the switching logic if ''''1'''' defined or not. 
* Note the enclosure of the break HTML command... Your custom message should end with one and tie in with the Timestamp message so everything reads nicely!
}}
;which displays like this (unlike the NEW parameter, REV does not display)
{{TRS-underconstruction|inhibit=1|REV=GLOPS|1={{col| on the WXYZ Trainz topic and it's complications.|#0F0F0F}} (This is where an argument passed as '1' is displayed.) &lt;br/&gt;Note how the text should lead into the boilerplate of the timestamp message...}}
&amp;nbsp;

== [[W:Category:52-card deck solitaire card games]] ==

Most of the pages in that Wikipedia category, and its sister categories, are roughly just guide on how to play the games, thus I have created [[Solitaire card games]] here, Thank you --[[User:TheChampionMan1234|TheChampionMan1234]] ([[User talk:TheChampionMan1234|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TheChampionMan1234|contribs]]) 22:27, 9 April 2014 (UTC)

* [[Solitaire card games/Aces Up]] - done
* [[Solitaire card games/Agnes (card game)]] - done
: I've made a start on these but as I don't know of any quicker way to mass import it would take a long time to import all of these.  Could you say which of these are the most needed especially as the original category on Wikipedia seems to have been deleted and/or merged with another category.  The above that I've imported so far have been put in the Solitaire card games book but haven't been linked to from the main page of that book.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:09, 12 April 2014 (UTC)
::There is a way of doing it in bulk. On Wikipedia you would use [[Special:Export]], which allows a whole category to be exported, then you'd use [[Special:Import]] here to import the XML file that was exported from Wikipedia.

== Site Notice / Featured Books ==

I have had a clear out of old discussions on Featured Book Nominations (and also VfD).  As there seems to have been so little activity with regards to such discussions recently I have added a notice about Featured Books and the discussions on the site notice.  I noticed on other Wikimedia sites that they frequently include similar notices encouraging community discussion (see Wikinews and Wikivoyage).  Any opinions?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:48, 12 May 2014 (UTC)

== Archiving ==

Is it easy to change the frequency of archiving for the various Reading Rooms.  Wikibooks (or at least the Reading Rooms) is a lot less active than in the past and it's a pain returning after a break to have to plough through all of the various archives.  Seems to be archiving everything after 21 days of no activity - would it be feasible to change this to 45 or 60 days?  Also noticed that [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives]] didn't have lists for 2013 so I've added them.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:42, 17 March 2014 (UTC)
: Each page should have a template call at the top to {{tl|User:MiszaBot/config}}.  One of the parameters is&amp;nbsp; {{nowrap|1=algo = old(21d)}}&amp;nbsp; which can presumably be changed from 21 to 45 or 60 with the desired efect.  I'd be okay with 60.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 01:24, 18 March 2014 (UTC)

== Welcome template for Class Project users ==

Since there are so many new users involved in academic projects I thought it was a good idea to create a welcome template for such users.  I have created [[Template:Classwelcome]].  I hope somebody can edit it further as more should be said.  As with all welcome messages it should be substituted.  Maybe it would be better to refer to the users as being involved with academic projects as many of these seem to be university students so ''class'' isn't the appropriate word (at least not in Europe).--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:46, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

: Should welcome messages be substituted?  I'm not actively disagreeing, just wondering about the reasoning involved.  On Wikinews, we never (intentionally) substitute the {{((}}[[n:Template:Howdy|Howdy]]{{))}} template, which is transcluded on a humongous number of user talk pages (I see it's over a million now); every few years, when we decide to upgrade it, the upgrade gets deployed to ''everyone's'' user talk page.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 18:59, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
::I have always substituted them because I recall reading somewhere that I should and there's no need for old welcome messages to be updated I'm guessing (as the message has already been read).  I don't know much about the technical side of all this except that people claim that substituting is less demanding on the servers but to what extent I don't know.  As for academic project people, I know it's not always clear if a new user is here for an academic project but often the type of page they edit or their username will give it away (for some projects everybody has a similar username).--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:16, 5 May 2014 (UTC)
::: True, there ''is'' a server demand issue:  a single edit to the Wikinews Howdy template would require the server to update over a million pages.  So it's not something to do unless distributing the change like that is really what one wants.  Fair enough.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 02:36, 6 May 2014 (UTC)
== Do we need 7 different Reading rooms? ==

In the Discussion category we have:
General | Proposals | Projects | Featured books

In the Assistance category we have:
General | Technical | Administrative

Do we really need this many reading rooms?  Could the General discussion and Proposals be merged?  And the General and Technical Assistance be merged too?  Having two rooms named General also seems a bit confusing?  I can see why Wikipedia needs so many rooms but other projects seem to manage with fewer - I only see one regularly used at Voyage.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:43, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
:And after my little rant I now realise that I've probably filed this message in the wrong reading room.  Another problem possibly?  People often are not sure where to put their messages.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 21:45, 19 May 2014 (UTC)

:: At en.wn we have five water coolers.  Nowadays some of them might not see anything posted in a given month.  Nobody's even suggested consolidating; it's a given that better times are ahead, and the infrastructure for keeping things straight is already in place for when it's more needed than it is now.

:: '''However''', the point about people not knowing where to post is important.  I'd want to address it by some means other than collapsing the infrastructure, but it should be addressed.

:: And, well, yes, the preferred reading room for the topic would probably be &quot;Proposals&quot;. ;-)&amp;nbsp; --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 22:03, 19 May 2014 (UTC)

(edit conflict) English Wikinews has 5 places in their [[n:Wikinews:Water cooler|water cooler]], plus the Newsroom (which I think is like the Projects Reading Room). English Wikinews may not have featured news because they list many current news stories on their main page. I think the General Discussion and General Assistance reading rooms could be merged. I think proposals should be kept separate to keep from overwhelming any other discussions or assistance people may need. I think technical assistance should be kept separate to ease tracking by people who can help. Administrative assistance might make sense to discontinue as administrators already watch the other reading rooms, and because there might not be much there that doesn't overlap with other requests for assistance or discussions. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:26, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
: (Just an aside &amp;mdash; The Newsroom isn't a place for discussion, it's a place where unpublished articles are automatically listed sorted by status; mainly, not yet submitted for review, and failed review so potentially in need of repairs.  Articles can't be nominated for [[n:WN:FA|Featured Article status]] until they're archived, a week or more after publication; there's a page for discussing [[n:WN:FAC|FA nominations]].)

: Merging General Discussion and General Assistance seems fairly reasonable to me.  It ''should'' be raised at the proposals rr, though, because there's a reasonable expectation by people who may care about the decision, and who might not be watching here, that such a thing would be raised there.

: I'm uncomfortable about discontinuing administrative assistance; there should always be a place to ask for help from the admins.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 23:11, 19 May 2014 (UTC)
:: I agree this proposal should be moved to the proposals rr for the reasons you mentioned. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:30, 19 May 2014 (UTC)

:''This topic has been moved from [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Assistance]]''--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:49, 19 May 2014 (UTC)

About administrative assistance, there are already specific pages to request specific assistance from administrators. The only remaining requests seems to be ones that may require discussion or anyone can do, much like anyone can discuss whether to keep or delete books at RFD/RFU and anyone can evaluate what the consensus is. Administrative action is only required when/if consensus is to delete.

I think the distinction between discussion and assistance might be the main problem with the organization of the reading rooms. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:18, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

: On the second point, if the distinction between discussion and assistance is a problem, then I expect the solution to be difficult to work out.  Actually, looking at the nav bar at the top of this page, it looks more intuitive the more we discuss changing things.  We'll want to think this through very carefully.

: I'd like to explore the first point.  You say &quot;there are already specific pages to request specific assistance from administrators&quot;.  Hmm.  What pages are you referring to?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 01:17, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

:: I think the solution is easy with General and Assistance merged there is no overlap with the rest:
::* Technical − Ask questions, request assistance, and discuss technical issues
::* Proposals − Suggest and discuss ideas for improving Wikibooks
::* Projects − Ask questions, request assistance, and discuss book-related problems
::* Imports − Request material and files be imported to Wikibooks
::* Permissions − Request access to addition tools
::* Renames − Request name changes
::* RFD/RFU − Request and discuss (un)deletions
::* Featured books − Request and discuss featured status for books
::* General − All other questions, requests, and community discussions

:: Imports and Renames are requests for specific assistance from administrators. Requests in the other reading rooms may require assistance from administrators to implement depending on what is being requested. People don't always understand what requests may require assistance from administrators and what requests do not. Requests may also not be clear from the beginning whether there is a need for administrator assistance or not. I think ambiguities in who assistance is needed from should be addressed with either specific request pages with focus on the request type and not the who, or when unknown should be addressed with something more general that isn't administrator specific with the assumption that anyone can generally help and if a request really does request assistance from someone with access to specific tools then a person with those tools can join the discussion and address the problem. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:20, 20 May 2014 (UTC)
: Intuitive?  Hardly.  Just look at the amount of discussions in the various rooms which begin with ''Not sure if this is the right place, but...''.  And any kind of message or proposal can turn into a discussion.  Though I quite like the description above Darklama - I had no idea that that was what the Proposals and Projects rooms were for.  I'd presumed Projects was related to ''class'' projects and I had gathered that Proposals was for this kind of discussion but also guessed it was for book-related proposals.  Anyway, most of these pages are not ''reading rooms'' - maybe there could be one ''reading'' room and several other things with a somewhat different name (just as RfD is not the Deletions reading room).--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 09:35, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

:: @[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]]. What pages are not ''reading rooms''? What do you propose to change now? Maybe we agree. Maybe we disagree. I do not know.

* Regarding the exitence of many specific pages for different kinds of adminstrative requests &amp;mdash; that's no substitute for having a simple, easy-to-find place to ask for administrative help.  There's a good chance that sort of request may come from folks who are either already having trouble figuring out what's what, or already feeling harassed/frustrated/generally put-upon and don't need another hassle figuring out where to go to ask for assistance.  I would expect any sister project to have a single general-purpose clearinghouse for administrative concerns, regardless of how many more specialized pages there are.

: Other issues here seem to be about knowing where to go, and I think that's very bound up with the way the menu bar is constructed.  I'm gonna need to think about that a bunch more.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 11:25, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

:: @[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]]. I think people don't need the added hassle of figuring out where to go to ask for assistance, where to go to discuss things, or to whom it may concern. I think the priorities are getting answers to questions and getting problems fixed, rather than who answers or fixes the problem. I would expect any community-driven project to have a single general-purpose place where people can get answers and have their problems fixed, regardless of how many more specialized pages there are. I think what should or shouldn't be brought up on the administrative page is added hassle people don't need and is the result of the page being either too specialized or not specialized enough.
:: I think the main issue is about knowing where to go. I too think the layout of the navigation bar/menu is part of the problem. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:40, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

::: I suspect we agree on a ''lot'' more than we disagree on here.  If someone brings a question to one place, and some other place would have been better, they ought not to be (a)&amp;nbsp;berated for being in the wrong place, or (b)&amp;nbsp;told that such-and-such would be a better place and told to go reask their question there.  And they souldn't ''worry'' that either of those things might happen.  Various helpful responses are possible, neither (a) or (b) amongst them.  This is, perhaps, an important ingredient to keep in mind for any upgrade:  the nav bar should help them to usually pick a pretty okay place to ask ''without'' creating anxiety over where the user should be taking their concern.  The clarity, and the reliably pretty-good choice, and the lack of anxiety are all parts of what we want.

::: Keeping in mind the non-anxiety factor, I'm saying there should be a place one can raise issues that are meant to be particularly brought to the attention of admins.  One certainly ought not to respond to ''other'' placement of such a post with any of the unhelpful responses such as aforementioned, but there should be a place for admin-relevant concerns particularly.  Some people will be ''expecting'' that there is such a place, and if they can't find it, ''that'' may cause distress to them.

::: Note that this is not ''only'' about the user knowing where to post.  That's obviously hugely important.  But it ''is'' also a matter of where each discussion ultimately gets archived.  Admin concerns ''ought'', I suggest, to be archived in a place where one can find such things collected.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:12, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

:::: I want to reduce distress and anxiety about where posts ought to be placed, who ought to address particular concerns, and where past discussions ultimately ought to be archived. People also shouldn't be hassled because only administrators or whoever can address their problems and told they need to repost somewhere else to get attention from the &quot;right&quot; people. Getting attention from the &quot;right&quot; people should not be a problem. I think there should be no &quot;wrong&quot; place to post, or one &quot;right&quot; approach to get attention from the &quot;right&quot; people. Wikibooks has made searching the archives easier, but there is probably more that could be done so that one search will return all relevant community discussions. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:54, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

::::: It occurs to me en.wn has one other page, not considered part of the water cooler, related to this discussion:  [[n:WN:AAA|WN:AAA]] &amp;mdash; Admin Action Alerts.  That's the page that corresponds, roughly, to our Administrative Assistance reading room &amp;mdash; and, as I say, it's not considered a water cooler (equiv reading room) at all.

::::: The five water coolers (while we're accumulating comparisons that might provide some snippet of relevant insight) are Policy, Proposals, Technical, Assistance, and Miscellaneous.  Those seem to me to be considerably better defined than our set of reading rooms, even though there are situations where more than one choice is reasonable.  Food for thought.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 17:52, 20 May 2014 (UTC)

:::::: For the sake of disclosure and any potential bias, I draw a comparison with the water cooler because I made the original proposal that resulted in the split of the reading room, I was influenced by Wikinews' approach, and the name &quot;reading room&quot; was proposed along with it. Prior to that, the reading room consisted of a single page named &quot;staff lounge&quot;, and the administrative assistance was known as the &quot;administrator's noticeboard&quot;. I think I may have suggested merging the administrator's noticeboard into the general reading room then as well. I know I felt a far clearer overlap between the two pages existed back then. The general reading room is like the miscellaneous water cooler. I didn't suggest a policy page back then because the common practice at the time was to discuss on a proposed policy's discussion page and announce the discussion in the site notice. I think there is still no need for a policy page because those can be discussed here in the proposals reading room should the need ever arise, plus consensus from proposals can lead to policy changes, which has happened in the past. What do you think needs to be better defined? I guess maybe my involvement in the reading room's conception leads me not to see how the reading rooms aren't clearly defined already. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:40, 30 May 2014 (UTC)

Broadly I'm neutral on this, with the following exceptions. There are two groups of people who come here from other Wikimedia project and are looking immediately for assistance (so their first edit is usually to a Reading Room): The Small Wiki Monitoring Team (&quot;SWMT&quot;) including Global Rollbackers and Global Sysops who want to make vandalism reports / block requests; editors wanting to usurp an account in order to complete their Single Unified Login and are directed here from Meta. The renames / usurps are handled by Bureaucrats so are better left on their own page IMO. It can be named something else if people want but I think it is best just left as is because I've only seen a couple of misplaced rename requests so it obviously works. For the SWMT, a page that is familiarly named is most useful as not all are English first-language speakers. So &quot;Administrative Assistance&quot;, &quot;Administrators Noticeboard&quot; or something similar is best I think. [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 13:52, 30 May 2014 (UTC)

: I think everything in the requests part of the top navigation is clearly defined and should be kept as is. I think the administrative assistance is not clearly defined. Based on your comment, I think a reading room to discuss and report problematic behavior would be clearer than &quot;administrative assistance&quot;. How about the &quot;user mediation&quot; reading room? Administrative assistance could be renamed leaving the redirect behind, or simply redirected, either would leave a redirect behind for SWMT to find. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:10, 30 May 2014 (UTC)

:: A passing thought:  mediation pretty much doesn't work.  It's basically begging to escalate a situation and maximize how disruptive it is for as long as possible.  I'm not saying I know an ideal alternative, but mediation is horrible and definitely ought not to be encouraged as a default way of thinking.  Mediation is part of the interlocking infrastructure by which Wikipedia makes itself a troll-haven.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:43, 30 May 2014 (UTC)

::: Mediation/Arbitration hasn't worked for English Wikibooks either. Maybe people are anxious about any page being used to discuss and report problematic behavior out of the fear that it is begging to escalate a situation to maximize disruption for as long as possible. Maybe that is why these type of pages always use a less specific name compared to other request pages. Meta has RFC, which people use to propose things and to propose blocks. I remember when I was new to Wikibooks, before I knew anything about how the wikimedia projects work, I sought out help on the irc channel for my questions because I didn't know where else to go, and figured anyone who ran the website would be there. Seems like other people new to Wikibooks now often resort to an admin's user discussion page when they have questions or need help with something. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 16:54, 30 May 2014 (UTC)

::::My original concern was simply that so many rooms were unnecessary because it means looking in several rooms to find what you want and because it may bewilder new users (or me).  I also felt that the descriptions weren't clear enough.  But it's clear people don't want anything to change so no bother.  As for mediation - Wiki attitudes to this are often ridiculous as can be seen on Wikipedia where old-timers simply baffle less-experienced editors with their knowledge of Wiki jargon thus getting their own way or the fiasco of Panic's ridiculous mediation / arbitration / whatever many years ago (although that is all very amusing looking back at the long discussions and blocks / unblocks in the archives).--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 18:53, 30 May 2014 (UTC)

== Blue text ==

Hi, I am a new user and am working as part of a group of six people looking at the &quot;Always On&quot; aspect of the Digital Media and Culture Yearbook project at the University of Stirling. 

My query is how do I get certain words that are already in Wikipedia, such as 'bandwidth' to appear in blue (so that they link to Wikipedia) when I use these words in my own contribution? Sorry if this is a really silly question. Hope you can help. Thanks.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 21:59, 31 March 2014 (UTC)

: Hi [[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]].
: Because this is Wikibooks, if you write an ordinary wikilink, it only links to a page with that name on Wikibooks.  If you write markup &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Reykjavík]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, you get a redlink, [[Reykjavík]], because there isn't a book called that.
: Books are relatively self-contained; that's part of what makes them books.  So we don't link all that often to other wikimedia projects, such as Wikipedia.  There's a prefix for each of the sister projects, that can be used to create links to them; but sister links within a book are relatively few, and are typically set aside from the text, such as in a box on the right or in a list at the bottom of a page.  Here's a link to a Wikipedia page:  [[w:Reykjavík|Reykjavík]].  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 01:45, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

Thanks for insight re usual practice for Wikibooks - really appreciated. If I were to make a link - such as the one you made for Reykjavik - how would I do this? I thought perhaps highlighting the word, then right-clicking to save the short-cut would work - but it doesn't. I suspect I have to use some markup codes - is that correct? Thanks again.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 17:27, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

: If you edit the markup code of this thread, you'll find that the markup code I wrote to produce that wikilink to Wikipedia was &lt;nowiki&gt;[[w:Reykjavík|Reykjavík]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.  The &quot;w:&quot; tels it to link to Wikipedia, and the part after the pipe (the &quot;|&quot;) is how the link appears on the page.

: (This touches on a sore spot of mine, in Wikimedia Foundation politics.  I think it's a mistake for the foundation to be pouring resources into building tools to isolate users from the wiki markup.  When working directly with wiki markup, you can learn by seeing what others have written, and slowly learn the few simple techniques that make up nearly all of wiki markup writing, as you need them, each step building on the previous ones you've learned.  And tack on advanced techniques when you really need them, as small add-ons to what you already knew.  But when working with all those tools, you often don't get to learn by seeing others' work, and the things you learn don't get you any closer to the really advanced things.)

:: Seconded.

Thanks very much once again - I've cracked it now. I do agree with the sentiments from both of you - it seems as if a lot of energy (at least in the initial stages of learning) can go into learning/navigating the markup code rather than learning/advancing a topic per se.[[User:George Berrie|George Berrie]] ([[User talk:George Berrie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/George Berrie|contribs]]) 16:33, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

== Glossary Help ==

Hi all, I'm new to Wikibooks and I am engaging in a collective project looking at Online Identity. Our project is going well, however I have noticed that our glossary is lacking and we are perhaps slightly unsure of how to use it. I was wondering what sort of words we should be considering adding? Is it in general that we should be adding words which are the main focus of our project, or should we be considering any words in our project that have the potential to be contentious?

:As a book creator I rarely see a need for a glossary in today's connected world, unless the terms are very obscure and would consider only doing it at a lower priority for a book that would be intended for print. As a reader (and in normal editorial practice) I prefer linking the terms to Wikibooks, Wikipedia or Wikitionary (in that order) or even cross linking to the section of the book that provides the information.
:Keeping a glossary complete and accurate is a work into itself, if we considered how wikibooks are edited it would require extreme dedication as not to be a futile effort.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 20:05, 2 April 2014 (UTC)

[[User:GemmaMiller|GemmaMiller]] ([[User talk:GemmaMiller|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/GemmaMiller|contribs]]) 16:26, 1 April 2014 (UTC)

: The most easy way to upload images to be used anywhere in the [[wmf:Our projects|WikiMediaSphere]] (including Wikibooks) is, I believe, to do so via [[commons:|WikiMedia Commons.]]

: The rules are pretty simple, – you can upload an image if either:
:* you’ve made it all by yourself – it may be a drawing, a photography of nature, etc. – and agree to release it under the terms of one of the [[w:Free content#Legal matters|free licenses;]]
:* you’ve got it off the Web, and its respective copyright holder (which may be its author, publisher, or some other party) have allowed its unlimited redistribution and use under (again!) a free license;
:* the copyright on the work has expired and it entered [[w:Public domain|the public domain.]]

: Be sure to check the Commons’ [[commons:Special:UploadWizard|Upload Wizard]] – it’s supposed to guide you through some of the intricacies of the rules.

The majority of the ideas I am referring to are from the same author, so do I only reference him once, or do I reference each idea with the correlating page number to his book? Probably a really obvious answer, just not too sure how to go about it! Thank you.

== Contacting Wikibooks participants ==

: &lt;small&gt;Moved from [[Wikibooks talk:Reading room]].&lt;/small&gt;

Hi, I just wanted to know why some user names on WikiBook come up as red and say that the user does not exists and others are in blue? What does this mean?

Also I wanted to know how I get in contact with a person if I have their wiki name, how would I go about finding their personal wiki page?

: A red link in user’s signature may mean that the user in question has not created a personal page at this project.  In this case, the wiki will tell that it’s the ''user page'' that does not exists, not the user, however.

: Alternatively, may mean that the user has configured his or her signature to use red color for the link.

: The simplest way to contact the user is probably to write a message on his or her own ''talk'' page, such as [[User talk:Ivan Shmakov]] or [[User talk:SmithBiancaAnn]].  Typically, a link to that page will be included in the user’s signature.

== Content Publication ==

Hey guys, I'm also working with an educational group on the Technological Determinism page - I am wondering about the etiquette of publishing information to the page before it is entirely complete. Of course, we are looking to get as much accurate and complete information as possible, but at what stage would it be advisable to publish to the public page so that we have something presentable, although inevitably imperfect? e.g. in terms of referencing complete, etc.

== Using a single reference for an entire sub-section? ==

Hi there, I'm a new user and I'm slightly confused as to what the rules are for using a single in-text citation for an entire sub-section. Within the sub-section I have written I have split the text up into three separate paragraphs, all of which use the same in-text citation. Should I just put one in-text citation at the end of the sub-section or should I have the same citation at the end of each paragraph within the sub-section? Any help would be much appreciated! [[User:SilentJamie|SilentJamie]] ([[User talk:SilentJamie|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SilentJamie|contribs]]) 09:40, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

== Links to glossary? ==

:It's unusual to see it done. I have used this model in my book. You'll see an example in this [[Castles of England/Methods of Attack|chapter]]. Go to the '''Mining''' section and click on the last word in the section ('''countermine''') and it will link you to the definition in the Glossary. The way this is implemented is to label each word in the Glossary. To continue with Countermine, the code looks like this in the Glossary: &quot;'''&lt;nowiki&gt;;Counter mine (or countermine) : &lt;div id=&quot;Countermine&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''. Then within the Mining section the code is the same as that used to go to any section on a page: '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Castles of England/English Castle Glossary#Countermine|counter mine]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''. If you use section headers in the Glossary (e.g., put each definition under its own head of the format '''&lt;nowiki&gt;=====Glossary Word=====&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' then you can link to it in the same way. I just used the &quot;div&quot; method because it made the Glossary look prettier.[[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 11:48, 3 April 2014 (UTC)

The their route was disconnected near Rion. The range of the Reps is limited, over 50. They might cooperate, but only if we provide the support for them, this is not possible at this level, but if we rebuild NEW Atlantis (beta), it's a different story, otherwise they will probably retaliate to cover their own ass. I believe they have done this 5 times. Also the reps are based at spio, they can not leave the base, but they have access to the tech, it is their source code.

: Hi, [[User:MisterRogors|MisterRogors]].
: A tip that may help you make sense out of things.  The word you actually want there is ''wikimedia'' rather than ''wikipedia''.  That's because wikipedia is just one of several sister projects in the wikimedia family.  This sister here, where we are now, is Wikibooks; we write textbooks here.  Wikipedia, [[w:|over there]], writes encyclopedia articles.  And there are other sisters too, of course:  [[wikt:|Wiktionary]] is a dictionary (not just of English words &amp;mdash; it gives definitions of words in all the world's languages.  [[wikt:|Wikinews]] writes news articles (with its own unique challenges and rewards).  And so on.
: Knowing that will probably help you make more sense out of the welcome messages of the different sisters:  each sister has a different welcome message, that tells you stuff about that sister, but may be a little different, or sometimes a lot different, from how things work on the other sisters.  (I see you've already gotten a welcome on your user talk page here at Wikibooks.  Welcome!).
: (A trick to keep in mind, btw:  if you sign your message with three tildes (&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;) it'll sign just your name, like your sig above; four tildes will produce your name and the time and date when you signed.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 10:53, 5 April 2014 (UTC)

:Unfortunately the majority of people at Wikibooks find themselves working alone. You will get help in terms of copy-editing, etc., but in terms of new content creation you are unlikely to find someone to help out with substantial contributions. Typically they want to work on their own book. One option to get you started is to identify articles on Wikipedia that can be incorporated with some revision into your book. These can then be imported (via a request at [[WB:RFI]], do not just copy / paste the material).

Does there already exist a wikibook -- or a section of a wikibook -- that lists typical periodic laptop maintenance tasks?

[[How To Assemble A Desktop PC/Choosing the parts]]
briefly mentions cleaning the screen.

[[Minimizing Hard Disk Drive Failure and Data Loss/Data Reduction]]
mentions &quot;routine cleanup&quot;.

[[Minimizing Hard Disk Drive Failure and Data Loss/Data Redundancy]]
mentions backups, but I am surprised at its insistence that &quot;having a backup of all their data can be entirely impractical&quot;,
and its implication that backups must be done manually
(rather than, say, scheduling automated backups every night at 1 am).

Where can I find a listing of all the typical periodic laptop maintenance tasks together on one page?
If one does not exist, which wikibook would be the most appropriate for starting a rough draft of such a list?

== I introduce myself ==

Lafcadio, my username, is from Lafcadio Hearn, who was a famous New Orleanian who edited a cookbook of creole cookery. Subsequently he went to Japan, where he is more famous than here. 

I am from a creole family in the country, along river road. I have lived my entire adult life in New Orleans, however, and greatly admire its authentic cuisine, which is often confused with cajun cuisine. Creole cuisine is based on the haute cuisine of France, with the addition of ingredients from the new world and Africa. 

I am putting my family recipes in the Wikipedia cookbook, in the hope of preserving them for posterity. Most of these are my mother's recipes, but some are recipes that I have obtained from friends or adapted from cook books, and used for years.

Hi! I just edited the 8th grade science book, and I was hoping someone could take a look. I generally work on Wikipedia, but I thought to give Wikibooks a try. Nice to meet everyone!

== Copy/Paste Moves of Content Within Wikibooks ==

I have just started renovating [[Microsoft Office]]. I have added some code to the [[Microsoft Office/Windows Basics|Windows Basics subpage]], but I now want to move some of that content to different pages. I don’t simply want to move that page, as I will be splitting the named subpage into two different subpages (I’m planning on calling them “Windows Versions” and “Logging In and Out”, if you’re curious). It would seem that the best way to do this is to create a new page and copy/paste the relevant text into the new page.

However, Wikipedia has rules that restrict the use of copy/paste moves of content from one Wikipedia page to another. I was wondering what is the policy for such moves here. (By the way, if anyone has a better way to split a page in this fashion, please don’t hesitate to tell me.) Thanks!

: Note: As no one has responded, and having researched Wikipedia’s policy on copying within the project, I am going to proceed following their rules as if they apply here. If this isn’t true, please tell me. Specifically, I will place {{[[Template:Copied|Copied]]}} on the source page’s talk page, as required by [[w:Wikipedia:Copying within Wikipedia|w:Copying within Wikipedia]].

::You can move content freely inside the same work (if no opposition arises from the changes made, note that if the book is active or well developed you should probably post about the intended changes first). You can even copy (duplicate) content with some considerations across distinct projects or better yet if the content benefits from keeping synchronized and updated you can also try trasnclusion of the significant part or you can simply merge projects (if the source project is &quot;dead&quot; and not great loss of content will result from it).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 06:47, 5 July 2014 (UTC)

:: … But in any case, my personal advice would be to ''always'' include a link to the source page in the “summary” for the edit.  (As in: &lt;nowiki &gt;Copying contents of [[Example Book/Its section#And subsection]].&lt;/nowiki&gt;)  Otherwise, the text added may ''seem'' an original contribution (as per its “history” record), and thus violate the “BY” clause of the CC BY-SA license used here.  — [[User:Ivan Shmakov|Ivan Shmakov]] ([[User talk:Ivan Shmakov|d]] ▞ [[Special:Contributions/Ivan Shmakov|c]]) 06:59, 5 July 2014 (UTC)

:::Agree, adding the comment should be a no-brainer (what else would one put in&lt;s&gt;t&lt;/s&gt; as a comment) but the licensing/copyright part is not correct, the general view is that the Wikibooks project ^(as the aggregate of all projects) is a itself a aggregation of works and so site wide umbrella license exists and inside the wiki environment of Wikimedia servers licensing issue do not occur, any licensing problem may only occur outside of Wikibooks (in the segregation of the individual works, like the required attributions etc and in importing content into the project). 
:::As for the page history capability of shading ling on copyright issue I have been for years very vocal that people that have/need/want interests in asserting copyright should not rely too much on them.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 08:34, 5 July 2014 (UTC)

:::: Personally, I’d consider the “BY” clause to be violated if the link to the author becomes unreachable from ''either'' the history (whether directly or indirectly, – via a link to the source page) ''or'' the talk page.  Besides, without this, determining authorship becomes quite an issue, which may be required irrespective of the specific license used here.

::::: Notice also that the CC is more lenient/less detailed in this respect than the GFDL but we are in agreement authorship/rights ownership should be protected and preserved where merited. This is something that sadly does not concern (or is fully understood, even in its simple implications) by a large part of the community and something that seems to not concern Wikimedia beyond protecting their own interests.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 17:13, 13 July 2014 (UTC)</text>

== This is a minor edit ==

Is there any way to change it so that the ''minor edit'' link just above the Save Edits button will open in a new window?  It is extremely frustrating to write lots of text and then accidentally click on the ''minor edit'' button by mistake and then have to go back and start all over again.  This is especially frustrating on a notebook mousepad or a touch screen notebook.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:35, 31 May 2014 (UTC)

: Already checked so it either doesn't work or it's intended for something else (not sure what).  Has nobody else experienced this?

== Beta Feature Bug Report ==

I just enabled the Compact Personal Bar site beta feature, and found out that it greatly improves the aesthetics of the user interface. However, I found a bug in the new UI. Namely, the “Help” link doesn’t work. I understand that it is supposed to point to https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Help:Contents, except that it really points to &lt;code&gt;https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Help:Contents&lt;/code&gt;, which doesn’t actually exist. Does anyone know how this could be fixed? (Not that I’d ever use this feature, but I still thought I would bring this issue to light.)

== Read-only back-ups of Wiki books? ==

I have pretty much by myself created the Wikibook &quot;International Postage Meter Stamp Catalog&quot;. Several changes have been made to it by others. Some were useful as they corrected errors or added new information. A few others may have been done with good intentions but ended up deleting links, destroying the formatting, or otherwise causing more problems than they solved. In an effort to recover from such mistakes I was wondering if there is a way I can store a read-only copy of the catalog somewhere online as a backup. This could be used as a starting point if the Wiki version goes FUBAR (screwed up beyond all repair). At some point I will be too old, senile, or deceased to continue monitoring the catalog, so a back-up would be valuable. I don't know how to do this. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

:You can use the PDF creator to create a saved version. Alternatively you can ensure that all the pages have been [[WB:Reviewer|reviewed]]. If you review every page to the highest level (Good) then this enables that version to be retrieved at any time in the future. Or you could just save a permanent link to the current version of each page (click the &quot;Permanent link&quot; link on the left hand sidebar) somewhere like your userpage. Of if you really want to go to town do the following:
*Go to [[Special:Export]].
*In &quot;Add Pages from Category&quot; enter the name of your book (it should have every page in the book in the category of the same name as the book).
*Click &quot;Add&quot;. You will see a list of all the pages.
*I suggest you tick all three checkboxes (Include only the current revision; Include templates; Save as file
*Click export
*You will be prompted to save the file (about 3.1Mb in size)
:This file contains all the pages and templates for the book and can be imported into any other wiki (assuming you have access), even your own wiki. For example, you could import it into a Wikia site. As a backup, this is the most complete and secure way to do it.

== Random book becomes random page? ==

Is it just me or did the Random book button on the sidebar use to point to a random book?  Now it just seems to load a page.  I actually prefer this because a problem with random book was that 70% of the time you ended up with a Cookbook recipe (as it thinks each recipe is a separate book).  Was something changed recently?  Could we maybe have both on the sidebar?--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_the_Isle_of_Mann.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:55, 19 June 2014 (UTC)

== Acknowledging contributors? ==

Hello all. I am trying to persuade colleagues to contribute to our Wikibook. The downside for them is that they could put a lot of work into a page, but their name won't appear on it (unless someone looks at the history), so their work won't be acknowledged. I am wondering if there is any established best practice for acknowledging contributors who put time into contributing to a book? Thanks, [[User:Peterz|Peterz]] ([[User talk:Peterz|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Peterz|contribs]]) 11:11, 19 May 2014 (UTC)

: Some books have a page to list contributors who wish to be acknowledged. However anyone who contributes must agree to [[Foundation:Terms of Use#7. Licensing of Content]] and because of that agreement anyone may choose to include a hyperlink or URL to a copy of the book rather than include the list when distributing copies of the book or when making derivative works. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:54, 19 May 2014 (UTC)

: Yes, many books at Wikibooks have a page where contributors (if they want their name to appear in the book) can add their own name.
: The most common arrangement I've seen is an &quot;About&quot; page that has an &quot;Authors&quot; section --
: [[Indonesian/About#Authors]], [[Video Game Design/About the Book#Authors]], [[English in Use/About#Authors]], [[German/About#Authors]], [[Nanotechnology/About#Authors and Editors]], [[C++ Programming/About the Book#Authors]], [[Isometric Pixel Art/About]], [[Transportation Economics/About#Authors]], [[Fundamentals of Transportation/About#Authors]], [[Hypnosis/About the Book#Authors]], [[Urdu/About#Authors]], etc.

== Guidance on Research ==

Hi, Wikibooks! I am considering contributing significant amounts of material to the [[Subject:Computer software|computer software section]], but am unsure about the rules regarding research from printed sources. Specifically:

I have access to a substantial library of printed computer reference material. What is the policy for using such materials as research? I understand that I cannot simply copy/paste or transcribe material from copyrighted sources. However, what is the rule for using printed books as reference, and then writing the final version in my own words? As much as I’d like to, I cannot research ''everything'' myself, as I do not have immediate access to some of the software I want to document. Any pointers?

Thanks! — [[User:SupremeUmanu|SupremeUmanu]] ([[User talk:SupremeUmanu|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/SupremeUmanu|contribs]]) 23:05, 6 June 2014 (UTC)

: You can use printed books as references. Usually published books have an ISDN that can be used to refer to a book in combination with [[Special:BookSources]], like &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Special:BookSources/0615538665|US History]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;. People will often reference material available for free online as well. References to multiple materials should be collected together in a [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style#Bibliography|bibliography]] like page within a book, rather then referencing material on every page like Wikipedia does. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:04, 7 June 2014 (UTC)

== Listen and Learn Science ==

Hello, 
I am in the process of writing a science book for Visually Impaired students.
The completed modules have been given to some students, in MP3 format, along with a player.
Feed back is positive.
Wish to publish ( and keep adding and updating ) this book in Wikibooks.
The objective, is to reach out to more visually impaired students.
They would be able to access the contents, using a screen reader.
The content has no diagrams, or visuals.
The contents ( like punctuation, spelling ) is tweaked, for a better audio experience.
Though sighted children could refer to this book,
I would expect the lack of visuals would be a handicap.
Have put in a sample page called - Atomic Structure.
I have a broad structure for the book.
It is about 20% complete.
I invite suggestions and contributions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background: ==
===What is Crohn's Disease? ===
Crohn’s disease (CD), categorized under a broader group of illnesses known as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal system.  Evidence suggests that CD is a large cause of morbidity within Australia,&lt;ref name=Ruthruff, B.,&gt;	Ruthruff, B., 2007, Clinical review of Crohn’s disease, Journal of American Academy of Nurse Practitioners &lt;/ref&gt; and it is estimated that 50 people per 100,000 are suffering this chronic disease&lt;ref&gt;	Colorectal Surgeons Sydney, Crohn’s Disease, http://colorectalsurgeonssydney.com.au/?page_id=397&lt;/ref&gt;. CD commonly effects people within their 20s and 60s&lt;ref name=&quot;number 3&quot;&gt;	Wick, J.Y., 2010, Crohn’s Disease: Managing a Complex and Chronic Condition, Pharmacy Times &lt;/ref&gt; and may also affect any portion of the alimentary tract, from the mouth to the anus, most commonly&lt;ref name=Ruthruff, B.,&gt;1.	Ruthruff, B., 2007, Clinical review of Crohn’s disease, Journal of American Academy of Nurse Practitioners &lt;/ref&gt;:
*Ileum and Cecum - 40% of CD cases 
*Small Intestine - 30% of CD cases 
*Colon - 25% of CD cases

=== Signs/Symptoms&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Y., &amp;Noble, E.G., 2008, is exercise beneficial to the inflammatory bowel diseases? An implication of heat shock proteins, School of Kinesiology, Faculty of Health Sciences, University of Western Ontario, London &lt;/ref&gt;:===
*Cramps/Abdominal pain
*Diarrhea 
*Weight loss
*Fatigue  
*Muscle weakness

=== Causes of Crohn's Disease&lt;ref name=&quot;number 3&quot;/&gt;:===
The main cause of Crohn’s disease is unclear although a number of possible causes have been suggested including: 
*Genetics - pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory markers 
*Microbial infection - microbial balance disrupted 
*Immunology - abnormalities of the immune system
*Environment - smoking etc. 
*Diet 
*Vasculature  
*Psychological factors 
A number of these possible causes of CD could be preventable, including: 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Preventable Factors     !! Non-Preventable Factors
|-
| * Poor diet&lt;br&gt;* Smoking. || * Age&lt;br&gt; * Race and gender&lt;br&gt;* Family History/Genetics 
|}
===Comorbidities:===
A number of comorbidity’s are associated with Crohn’s disease, mainly caused by medications, malabsorption, cell changes, lesions and intestinal blockages&lt;ref name=&quot;number 3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;number 4&quot;&gt;	Mazal, J., 2014, Crohn Disease: Pathophysiology, Diagnosis, and Treatment, Radiologic Technology, vol 85, No. 3&lt;/ref&gt;These include: 
*Osteoporosis and osteopenia 
*Depression 
*Reduced skeletal muscle mass and strength&lt;ref name= &quot;number 7&quot;&gt;Langenberg, V., Della Gatta, P., Hill, B., Zacharewicz, E., Gibson, P.R., &amp; Russell A.P., 2013, Delving into disability in Crohn’s disease: Dysregulation of molecular pathways may explain skeletal muscle loss in Crohn’s disease, Department of Gastroenterology &amp; Hepatology, Monash University, Box Hill, Victoria, Australia&lt;/ref&gt; and 
*Cancer
Patients who suffer comorbidities have a decreased quality of life, but prevention is possible.

==Common Treatments: == 
There are a number of treatments currently used to manage the symptoms associated with CD, including: 
*'''Medication''' - which is dependent on: the stage of the disease (active or remissive) and the level of severity (mild to severe) &lt;ref name=&quot;number 3&quot;/&gt;
*'''Surgery''': surgery is used to rectify problems including stricture, obstruction, fistulae 
*'''Complementary and Alternative Treatments'''&lt;ref name=&quot;number 4&quot;/&gt;:including probiotics, prebiotics and acupuncture. 
*'''Diet and lifestyle changes''': quit smoking etc. 
*'''Exercise:''' Aerobic and Resistance training

===Exercise&lt;ref name=&quot;number 5&quot;&gt;Perez, C. A., 2009,  Prescription of physical exercise in Crohn’s disease, Faculty of Education and Sport Science, University of Vigo, Spain &lt;/ref&gt;: ===
Recent research suggests that physical activity is now being recommended to a large number of people suffering from chronic illnesses, including CD. The positive effects associated with physical activity have the potential to improve an individual’s physical condition and quality of life. The table below illustrates some of the potential benefits physical activity possesses for individuals with Crohn’s disease.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Symptoms !! Type of Exercise !! Exercise Effects 
|-
| '''Pain''' – cramps located in the abdominal region produced by inflammation of the intestines.|| Stretching exercises and Extended swimming exercise.  || Induced analgesia – pain suppression. 
|-
| '''Bone Mineral Loss''' – due to calcium and vitamin D malabsorption, malnutrition and medications, || Aerobic, Muscular training and Balance exercises.  || Counteract bone mineral loss and reduce falls/fractures.
|-
| '''Fatigue''' – due to lack of physical exercise (decreased aerobic fitness and muscle strength).  || More research is needed to know which type of physical activity would obtain the best results. || Physical activity has a direct effect on a person’s feeling of energy, exercise could attenuate perceived fatigue. 
|-
| '''Intestinal Problems''' – diarrhea and constipation.|| Light to moderate exercise. . || Beneficial effects are mainly due to decreased gastrointestinal blood flow, neuroimmuno-endocrine alterations, increased gastrointestinal motility and mechanical bouncing whilst exercising.  
|-
| '''Body Composition''' – weight loss and malnutrition.   || Resistance training. || Increases total body weight and improves body composition, by increasing skeletal muscle mass. 
|-
| '''Sleep Disturbances''' - poor sleep patterns e.g. feeling hot and cold, abdominal pain, bad dreams and breathing problems.  || Aerobic exercise.  || Evidence suggest that aerobic exercises help people with sleeping problems, therefore CD patients may benefit.  
|-
| '''Anaemia'''  || Aerobic exercise.  || Reduce or prevent declines in erythrocyte levels.
|-
| '''Depression and Anxiety''' || Social/Team exercises.   || Anti-depressant effects e.g. hormonal changes. 
|}

==Recommendations:==
To determine physical activity for individuals suffering from CD including the type, frequency, intensity and duration, more research is needed to understand the '''exact''' benefits provided. However, recent evidence suggests there appears to be two main types of exercise that are beneficial for individuals with CD: aerobic activity and muscular resistance training. The following recommendations refer to the ideal training for maximum efficiency at reducing the signs and symptoms of Crohn’s Disease.

'''Aerobic Exercise&lt;ref name=&quot;number 5&quot;/&gt;:'''
*2-3 days per week for 20-30 minutes at low intensity 
*Exercises can include walking, cycling, swimming and low impact aerobics 
*'''Progression:''' increase to most days of the week when comfortable
'''Resistance Exercise&lt;ref name=&quot;number 5&quot;/&gt;:'''
*2–3 days per week completing 2-3 sets, 8-12 repetitions 
*Exercises that utilize the major muscle groups of the trunk and legs 
*Exercises completed at 50% 1RM (moderate intensity)
*Exercises can include the use of elastic bands and free weights 
*'''Progression:''' increase repetitions performed at 60% 1RM  

==Limitations and Considerations&lt;ref name=&quot;number 6&quot;&gt;Ng, V., Millard, W., Lebrun, C., &amp; Howard, J., 2006, Exercise and Crohn’s disease: Speculations of potential benefits, Can J Gastroenterol Vol 20, No. 10 &lt;/ref&gt;:==
It is important to note that exercise programs should be individualised and when planning an exercise routine, it is also essential to consider the physical limitations a CD patient may be suffering including: 
*'''Dehydration - ''' due to the high rate of diarrhea, fluid intake is essential (1-2 L per day).
*'''Age -''' important factor that influences physical ability. 
*'''Severity of disease - ''' the severe cases of CD experience a number of symptoms which make exercise difficult. 
*'''Medications - '''side effects may inhibit a patient from exercising comfortably. 
*'''Lack of Motivation - '''due to depression and negative self-image.
*'''Comorbidities - '''several comorbidities are associated with CD and may inhibit exercise further.
*'''Improving compliance - '''it is suggested that Crohn's patients participate within supervised exercise sessions or group activities.

== Further Reading:==
Research suggests that there is a positive link between exercise and its role in preventing or managing the burden of Crohn's disease, however the clinical recommendations and knowledge for exercise prescription are limited. Future studies into standardising an exercise regime for CD sufferers would be extremely beneficial in both prevention and treatment.

==Australia's weight loss industry==
Australians are continuing to invest increasing amounts of money towards becoming thinner and healthier. Throughout 2014-2015, Australians are expected to spend approximately 603 million dollars on weight loss services, low calorie foods and dietary supplements. &lt;ref name=&quot;IBISWorld&quot;&gt; IBISWorld, (2014). Weight Loss Services in Australia: Market Research Report, Retreived from: http://www.ibisworld.com.au/industry/default.aspx?indid=1704, &lt;/ref&gt;  
At any given time approximately one third of people are actively trying to lose weight and another third are trying to maintain their lost weight. &lt;ref name=&quot;Rankins&quot;&gt; Rankins, J., Williams. M., Montgomery, D &amp; Wilton, D. (2007). Demystifying weight loss diets. Ecology of Food and Nutrition, 45 (5), 379-403, DOI: 10.1080/03670240600985498. &lt;/ref&gt; However, regardless of these efforts we are still seeing an increase in the rates of overweight and obese Australians. In 2011-2012 approximately 63.4% of Australians were either overweight or obese, largely increased from 56.3% in 1995. &lt;ref name=&quot;ABS&quot;&gt; Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS). (2014). Australian Health Survey: First Results, 2011-12  , Retrieved from: http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/Lookup/4364.0.55.001main+features12011-12. &lt;/ref&gt;

Despite Australians efforts and financial investments into weight loss services we are not overcoming our battle with obesity.

==What is a fad diet?==

Fad diets promises rapid weight loss and a quick fix solution to health. They work by promoting restrictive and unbalanced diet behaviours, such as focusing on consuming single foods or nutrients, or by eliminating specific foods or food groups. &lt;ref name=&quot;Crowe&quot;&gt; Crowe, T. (2014). Are fad diets worth their weight? Australasian Science. Retrieved from: http://www.australasianscience.com.au/article/issue-januaryfebruary-2014/are-fad-diets-worth-their-weight.html. &lt;/ref&gt; These habits are focusing on short term changes that are unsustainable in the longer term and usually are not backed up with scientific evidence. &lt;ref name=&quot;Bredbenner&quot;&gt; Bredbenner, C., Beshgetoor, G., &amp; Berning, J. (2007). Wardlaws Perspectives in nutrition (8th ed.). New York: Michelle Watnick. &lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:A hanging carrot.jpg|thumb|]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==The four main diet approaches to weight loss:==
==1. Reduced energy diet==
Provide approximately 1000-1800 kcal per day with a balanced portion of energy from macronutrients, carbohydrates (CHO), protein and fat. &lt;ref name=&quot;Bredbenner&quot;&gt; Bredbenner, C., Beshgetoor, G., &amp; Berning, J. (2007). Wardlaws Perspectives in nutrition (8th ed.). New York: Michelle Watnick. &lt;/ref&gt;
Aims to create an energy gap by consuming less energy through foods than your body burns through functioning and daily activates.

'''Example: Weight watchers'''

==2. Low carbohydrate (CHO) diet ==
[[File:Foods (cropped).jpg|thumb|'''The Atkins Diet- Foods restricted: Breads, cereals, pasta, rice, fruits and vegetables''' ]]
 [[File:Protein (1).jpg|thumb|'''The Atkins Diet- Foods eaten freely: Animal products, red meats, eggs, fats, oils''' (1)]]
Works by limiting carbohydrates to between 20-100g per day while allowing unlimited amounts of protein and fats. &lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;&gt; Thomas, B., &amp; Bishop, J. (2007). Manual of Dietetic practice (4th ed.). Oxford (UK): Blackwell Publishing Ltd. &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

'''Example: The Atkins diet''' 

Restricts CHO to 20-30g per day. Results show that low CHO diets have better results at the 6 month point, but at 12months and beyond there was no difference from low fat diets. Research has shown this diet may increase LDL (bad) cholesterol by 2-3%. &lt;ref name=&quot;Clifton&quot;&gt; Clifton, P. (2006). The science behind weight loss diets: a brief review, Australian Family Physician, ,35 (8). Retrieved from: http://0- search.informit.com.au.alpha2.latrobe.edu.au/documentSummary;dn=362827884143825;res=IELHEA. &lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the American Heart Association cautions against following this diet due to its high saturated fat content. &lt;ref name=&quot;American Heart Foundation&quot;&gt; American Heart Association. (2014). High protein diets. Retrieved from: http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/GettingHealthy/NutritionCenter/High-Protein-Diets_UCM_305989_Article.jsp. &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==3. Low fat==

Fat is restricted to approximately 5-10% of total energy intake. Low fat diets are usually less energy dense. As fats contain more energy per gram 
compared to carbohydrates and protein you generally fill up on less energy dense foods. &lt;ref name=&quot;Clifton&quot;&gt; Clifton, P. (2006). The science behind weight loss diets: a brief review, Australian Family Physician, ,35 (8). Retrieved from: http://0- search.informit.com.au.alpha2.latrobe.edu.au/documentSummary;dn=362827884143825;res=IELHEA. &lt;/ref&gt;

| Fat|| 37kj
|-
| Protein|| 17kj

| CHO|| 16kj
|}

==4. Novelty diets==

Usually allows one specific food or food group and exclude almost all others. Generally very unbalanced diets which are difficult to sustain in the long term. &lt;ref name=&quot;Bredbenner&quot;&gt; Bredbenner, C., Beshgetoor, G., &amp; Berning, J. (2007). Wardlaws Perspectives in nutrition (8th ed.). New York: Michelle Watnick. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Example:'''

* The cookie diet
* The cabbage soup diet
* The lemon detox diet
* The raw foods diet.

==What do the results say about their success?==

Weight loss is a very complex process involving many physical and mental processes. Unfortunately there is no magical pill or quick fix solution to weight loss. While some diets promote themselves as an easy weight loss solution generally fad diets are highly restrictive and unsustainable. This often results in people feeling more disheartened about themselves than they started. 

Research has compared different diets consisting of varying amounts of protein, CHO, and fats, ranging from high CHO to a low CHO and high fat diet. Results found that at the six month point all diet groups had lost an average of 6kg, and by 12 months people had begun to regain weight. By 2 years all diets had similar results with no diet being more superior to another.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Sacks&quot;&gt; Sacks et al. (2009). Comparison of weight loss diets with different compositions of fat, protein and carbohydrates, The New England Journal of Medicine, 360 (9). 859-873.

The total energy intake is more important than the nutrient composition in determining weight loss 
results. &lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;&gt; Thomas, B., &amp; Bishop, J. (2007). Manual of Dietetic practice (4th ed.). Oxford (UK): Blackwell Publishing Ltd. &lt;/ref&gt;

==What should we do from here?==
In the US Americans are spending $33 billion dollars per year on fad diets. Instead people would be 
better off investing in a healthy eating and exercise plan which they can follow for the rest of their 
life. &lt;ref name=&quot;Bredbenner&quot;&gt; Bredbenner, C., Beshgetoor, G., &amp; Berning, J. (2007). Wardlaws Perspectives in nutrition (8th ed.). New York: Michelle Watnick. &lt;/ref&gt; For a majority of people, fad diets will not result in long term weight loss. Small and sustainable 
lifestyle changes will help to ensure long term weight management. &lt;ref name=&quot;Crowe&quot;&gt; Crowe, T. (2014). Are fad diets worth their weight? Australasian Science.

I used the code in this page, and other examples of Image in python, but in any of these cases, the cmd im.show() doesn't present anything. I'm using ubuntu, and I've downloaded xv.

      <comment>genesis, morph into a general /doc subpage though as representative syntax</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{doc-page-head}}{{typeTdoc}}
&lt;!-- Please add categories to the bottom of this page, and add interwikis to Wikidata. --&gt;
;Pupose:This is the main Named Division linking template for the [[Trainz|Trainz Wikibook]] divisions by Tabs 'binder' organization.
&lt;/noinclude&gt;{{TRS-hdrbox|no=no|altititle1=Trainz Linking Template}}{{Documentation subpage}}
=== Usage ===
;Note this \doc sub-page is included by more than one {{lc|Trainz link templates}}, as representative of the family of similar templates using the same syntax to link different groups of pages.

Template {{Tl|TL}} code: 
&lt;pre&gt;
{{#if:{{{1|}}}|[[Trainz/(TabName){{{1}}}{{#if:{{{3|}}}|#{{{3|}}}}}
    |{{{p|{{{3|{{{2|{{{1}}}}}}}}}}}}]]
    |[[Trainz (TabName)|(TabName)]]
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
The above code for {{Tl|TL}} has nothing where '(TabName)' snippet occurs, AND WHICH is characteristic of the other Trainz simple linking templates to book divisions.
* Hence for 'containers' (TabName)=containers in {{Tl|TRC}} and the no argument link formed is to &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/containers|containers]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; as can be seen in the header RHS bottom link.&lt;/code&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
;General usage
This template forms an internal link to the [[Trainz]] wikibook with parameter &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, and incorporates an option to access a section title on a page given the optional 3rd default parameter: &lt;code&gt; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}} or just |3=somepage&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as well allowing for as an optional pretty-link re-title parameter &lt;code&gt;'2' allowing &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}} and/or '|3=sub-page/' &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; formatted link calls ... all forming the link and all links in the wikimarkup as:&lt;br/&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/{{{1}}}{{#if:{{{3|}}}|#{{{3|}}}}}|{{{p|{{{3|{{{2|{{{1}}}}}}}}}}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/code&gt;
&amp;nbsp;
* Users unfamiliar with wiki-markup parameter parsing, just focus on &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{2}}} or '|2=text' &lt;/nowiki&gt; overriding the presented text of the link, 
* and &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}/  or '|3=sub-sub-linktext/' &lt;/nowiki&gt; giving a prefix to a sub-sub-page, so &lt;nowiki&gt;{{{3}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;,
: if and when given, &lt;u&gt;MUST HAVE&lt;/u&gt; a trailing '/' to form a proper link.
&amp;nbsp;
'''&lt;u&gt;Example-1, expanded paste down&lt;/u&gt;:'''
:This is because all template default parameters, formally 'numbered parameters' can also be specified like this:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL
 |1=Tips And Tricks
 |2=Tips
 }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 which wiki-markup language is processed exactly
 the same as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL |Tips And Tricks |Tips }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. 
;caution
When using a template such as this which forms a link, it is best to NOT use spaces between the pipe characters &quot;|&quot; as done for clarity above.
{{TrainzTip|Spaces in the 'pretty-text' part are fine!
}}
'''&lt;u&gt;In-line Examples&lt;/u&gt;:'''
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL|Tips And Tricks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; links as: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/Tips And Tricks|Tips And Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and the other formulation: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Tips And Tricks|Tips And Tricks]] &lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; both would.
:But... is much easier to edit around on a page when trying to get the best prose presentation.

* Similarly: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{TL|Tips And Tricks|Tricks}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; links as if the constructs: 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Trainz/Tips And Tricks|Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and 
:::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Tips And Tricks|Tricks]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; which is perhaps part of the phrase you want.

* Sub-subpage links will mainly be needed in the forthcoming Errorfixing series of tutorials and the Programmed Instruction (Trainz A-Z) linked progressive tutorials off their own sub-TOC base page. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
:Planned use of Sub-sub-pages... '''Better than splitting the book down the multiple tracks'''... we're going to make ''a lot of new pages'' in the PI tutorials! Whether for beginners or intermediate Trainzers, they'll all end in content creation and other advanced topics like TransDEM map generation anyway.

&lt;noinclude&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;

=== '''Background:''' ===

Depression is a condition that affects one in five Australians between 16- 85&lt;ref&gt;Facts and Figures about mental health and mood disorders, Black Dog Institue pdf, 2012, www.blackdogintitute.org.au (accessed 26 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== '''How Exercise affects the brain:''' ===

- Exercise stimulates the release of endorphins within approximately 30 minutes from the start of activity which assists in mood enhancement &lt;ref name = &quot;McGovern&quot;&gt;The Effects of Exercise on the Brain, MK McGovern, http://serendip.brynmawr.edu/bb/neuro/neuro05/web2/mmcgovern.html (accessed 21 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

- Exercise activates molecular and cellular cascades that support and maintain brain plasticity

- Promotes brain vascularization, neurogenesis (or the creation of new neurons), functional changes in neuronal structure and neuronal resistance to injury. 

=== '''What is Resistance Training:''' ===

Resistance Training is exercise that increases strength by making your muscles work against a weight or force.  Resistance or strength training includes free weights, machines, resistance bands or your own body weight. Generally resistance exercise is categorised as a Low to moderate intensity type of exercise, which is recommended by health experts for those suffering depression, however it can also be included as part of high intensity training such as circuit training.

=== '''Effect of Resistance training on Depression''' ===
 

Research indicates that resistance exercise can have positive effect on individuals suffering from depression. The general consensus among health professionals is that as long as an individual is participating in some form of moderate exercise there are usually positive effects on individuals affected by depression

- Improved self esteem

- Improved strength

- anti-depressive and anxiolytic effects

- increases endogenous opioid activity in the peripheral and central nervous
system

=== '''Exercise Recommendations''' ===

The Australian department of health recommends that adults aged between 18 -64 follow the following guidelines in relation to exercise. &lt;ref&gt;Physical Activity Guidelines, http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/Content/F01F92328EDADA5BCA257BF0001E720D/$File/brochure%20PA%20Guidelines_A5_18-64yrs.PDF, (accessed 17 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

|-
| '''Exercise type''' || Moderate || Vigorous
|-
| '''Duration (per week)''' || 150mins (2.5hrs) || 75mins (1.25hrs)

|}

The exercise type or intensity refers to how hard your body is working during physical activity.

Moderate exercise is defined as physical activity that burns between 3 - 6 METs (Metabolic equivalents) and Vigorous exercise is defined as physical activity that burns more than 6 METs. &lt;ref&gt;Examples of Moderate and Vigorous Physical Activity, hasp.harvard.edu (accessed 26 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

A MET or Metabolic Equivalent is the unit used to measure how much energy the body uses during a particular activity.&lt;ref&gt;Exercise Physiology,Theory and application to fitness and performance, eighth edition, Powers &amp; Howley,McGraw-Hill publishers NY 2012,(pg 22)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Physical activity Australia also recommends that we do muscle strengthening activities on at least 2 days each week &lt;ref&gt;Physical Activity Australia,  http://www.physicalactivityaustralia.org.au/index.php/resources/physical-activity-guidelines/ (accessed 17 September 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

= &lt;big&gt;The Effects of Exercise on Breast Cancer Recovery&lt;/big&gt; =

== Breast Cancer Prevalence ==
Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer related death in women (1). Prevalence is greater in more developed western countries; whereas the rates in less developed countries are low but increasing (1).  In 2002, more than 4.4 million women were reportedly living with breast cancer (2), while in 2008, estimates showed 1.38 million new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed, with 458,000 breast cancer related deaths (3). While breast cancer predominantly effects the female population, males are also susceptible, with 1500 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States alone (4).

== Risk Factors for Breast Cancer ==
While it is hard to decipher the exact cause of breast cancer, there are a number of risk factors associated with breast cancer development. It has been suggested that the incidence of breast cancer increases with age, with incidence rates doubling about every 10 years through until around the age of 50 when menopause occurs, following menopause, the rate increase substantially slows (5). Family history also plays a role in increased risk factors for breast cancer. Research suggests breast cancer risk was significantly greater for women with first-degree relatives with breast cancer.  This risk factor also increased with the number of first degree relatives whom had breast cancer (6). Additional personal risk factors for breast cancer include race, ethnicity, BMI, physical activity, alcohol use and smoking (6).

== Common Treatments and Interventions ==
Among the most common, successful treatments for breast cancer is radiation therapy and hormone control. The use of breast conserving treatment, which includes a partial mastectomy and radiation therapy on residual breast tissue, as an alternative for a full mastectomy for early-stage breast cancer has increased due largely to its cosmetic results (7). Multiple high-quality randomized trials has demonstrated the use of radiation therapy to play a crucial role in supporting breast conservation, enhancing local-regional control and improving the chance of survival, with approximately 120,000 breast cancer patients treated with radiation annually (8).

The development and implementation of diverse selective endocrine therapies has led a shift from ablative surgery and chemotherapy to a more targeted, less aggressive form of breast cancer treatment. The endocrine therapies have reportedly been better tolerated and have improved both quality of life and mortality in patients suffering from hormone-responsive disease (3). 

The use of diet and exercise interventions for breast cancer survivors helps to promote a healthy lifestyle. These interventions are commonly aimed at increasing levels of daily physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake and the levels of healthy lifestyle practices. Diet and exercise interventions have proven to reduce co-morbidities in cancer survivors and can protect against the recurrence of cancer-specific mortality (9). 

== Benefits of Exercise for Breast Cancer Recovery ==
Exercise interventions for breast cancer recovery should be used to help preserve or restore physical and psychological functions that are adversely affected by a cancer related therapies (10). Benefits from exercise based interventions for individuals recovering from breast cancer include improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness (11), greater peak oxygen consumption, (12), better physical functioning and a reduction in the symptoms of fatigue (11). It is a combination of these characteristics that leads to an increase in quality of life (11) (12) (13), which for people recovering from breast cancer should be an outcome held in high regard.

== Considerations for Exercise and Breast Cancer Recovery ==
Before commencing any exercise program, it is important for the prescribing practitioner or fitness professional to have an understanding of common therapeutic approaches to treating cancer (14). As a whole, most cancer patients will undergo some form of surgery, whether it be major or minor. Furthermore, around 50% or cancer patients will undergo some form of radiation therapy throughout their treatment (14). In addition to the abovementioned treatments, breast cancer patients will often be exposed to hormone therapies, with the type and duration of the treatment assigned on an individual basis (14). To prescribe a safe and effective exercise intervention, the specifics of the cancer diagnosis and treatment must be acknowledged. Further insight into pre-diagnosis fitness levels may also help to distinguish body systems adversely affected by therapies used (14). Other changes from breast cancer therapies may also include, but are not limited to, second cancers, fatigue, pain, changes to the cardiorespiratory and endocrine systems, and musculoskeletal variations (14).

== Exercise Recommendations ==
Prior to the commencement of an exercise programming, adequate testing from a medical team should be conducted. For breast cancer patients, this will include an evaluation of peripheral neuropathies, musculoskeletal morbidities and risks of fracture (14). Following a satisfactory outcome from medical evaluation, low to moderate intensity aerobic exercise, performed 3-5 times per week for at least 20 minutes per session, should be conducted with the aim to return the patient to regular daily activities (14) (15). Resistance exercise selection should be dynamic in nature and use both eccentric and concentric contractions (15). Resistance training should be conducted 1-3 times per week and incorporate 6-10 exercises, with 1-4 sets per muscle group. Intensity for resistance training should be between 50-80% of 1 repetition maximum (15).

== Atherosclerosis ==
Atherosclerosis is a disease of arteries where white blood cell accumulations and lipid aggregations of the endothelium start forming a plaque in the arterial wall, following by thickening of the vessel wall. Later, within decades, to may start causing stenosis in the lumen&lt;ref&gt;Stoll G, Bendszus M. Inflammation and atherosclerosis - novel insights into plaque formation and destabilization. Stroke. 2006;37:1923-1932&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stary&quot;&gt;Stary H.C. et al. A definition of advanced types of atherosclerotic lesions and a histological classification of atherosclerosis. Circulation. 1995;92:1355-1374&lt;/ref&gt; This results in smaller amount of blood flowing in the arteries which leads to lower levels of oxygen running in the arteries. In the heart atherosclerosis predisposes to coronary heart disease and possible myocardial infarction later but it can also cause serious consequences in the brain, kidneys and prevent oxygen supply also in the periphery causing claudication (pain in the feet caused by ischemia in the tissue) and impairing the healing of wounds, especially with diabetics.

=== Inflammation factor ===
As a background for stenosis is a damage in the endothelium caused by hypertension, hyperglycemia (pre-diabetics and diabetics), inflammation and toxins from smoking, for example. The low-density lipoprotein (LDL) -particles get into the vessel wall and attract monocytes and other white blood cells to the sub-endothelial space which cause chronic inflammation in the intima layer of the vessel&lt;ref name=&quot;Stary H.C.&quot;&gt;Stary H.C. et al. A definition of the intima of human arteries and of its atherosclerosis-prone regions. Circulation. 1992;85:391-405&lt;/ref&gt;. 
=== Lipid aggregates ===
The monocytes are activated into macrophages by different cascades and they start absorbing the oxygenated LDL-aggregates in. If there is not enough high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -particles reducing the amount of fat in the vessel wall, the macrophages become bigger foam cells and the plaque formation continues&lt;ref name=&quot;Stary H.C.&quot;/&gt;. Within the time, there is calcification and fibrous tissue formation among the smooth muscle cells in the arterial wall and a fibrous cap is formed around the plaque&lt;ref name=&quot;Stary&quot;/&gt;.

== Prevalence ==
The inflammation process and the plaque formation may start at an early stage in life but the people can be asymptomatic for decades until the stenosis is big enough to cause symptoms. In developed countries atherosclerosis is a leading cause of death and is a big factor behind many other diseases&lt;ref&gt;Tuzcu E.M. et al. High prevalence of coronary atherosclerosis in asymptomatic teenagers and young adults. Circulation. 2001;103:2705-2710&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2005 the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases in the general practice patient population of Australia was 30%&lt;ref&gt;Knox S.A. et al.

= Effect of aerobic exercise training on atherosclerosis =
It has been difficult to prove the beneficial effect of exercise training on atherosclerosis but studies show that aerobic exercise prevents the development of coronary artery disease (CAD) and reduces symptoms in patients with established cardiovascular disease, pointing to the health benefits of exercise training&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;&gt;Thompson P.D. et al. Exercise and physical activity in the prevention and treatment of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Circulation. 2003; 107: 3109-3116&lt;/ref&gt;. It also reduces the concentration of total cholesterol (TC), triglyserides (TG) and LDL-cholesterol, as well as increases the good HDL-cholesterol. Triglyserides are reduced for up to 72 hours after finishing the exercise and acutely, vigorous exercise decreases systolic blood pressure&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;/&gt;. Exercise is also beneficial for diabetics, as well as pre-diabetics by controlling the blood glucose. It was noticed that the intensity of exercise didn't make such a big difference but the health effects increased as the weekly amount of time spent exercising increased&lt;ref&gt;Kelley G.A, Kelley K.S. Aerobic exercise and lipids and lipoproteins in men: a meta- analysis of randomized controlled trials. The Journal of Men's Health and Gender. 2006;3(1):61–70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kodama S. et al.

Effects of the amount and intensity of exercise on plasma lipoproteins. N Engl J Med. 2007;347(19)&lt;/ref&gt;.

= Summary and recommendations =
Exercise is an important factor when it comes to preventing atherosclerosis and the diseases following it. Since the development of atherosclerosis starts at an early stage in life, it is important to start preventing it by exercising, avoiding sedentary behavior and eating healthy, even if you don't have any illnesses diagnosed. According to the Australian Government Department of health physical activity guidelines, adults (18-64 years) should do aerobic exercise preferably everyday consisting of 150-300 minutes of moderate intensity exercise or 75-150 minutes of vigorous intensity exercise per week&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government Department of health physical activity guidelines&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Breast Cancer Prevalence ==
Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer related death in women &lt;ref name=&quot;Key&quot;&gt;Key, T. J., Verkasalo, P. K., &amp; Banks, E. (2001). Epidemiology of Breast Cancer. 2(3).&lt;/ref&gt;. Prevalence is greater in more developed western countries; whereas the rates in less developed countries are low but increasing &lt;ref name=&quot;Key&quot;/&gt;.  In 2002, more than 4.4 million women were reportedly living with breast cancer, &lt;ref&gt;Veronesi, U., Boyle, P., Goldhirsch, A., Orecchia, R., &amp; Viale, G. (2005). Breast Cancer. 365(9472)&lt;/ref&gt;, while in 2008, estimates showed 1.38 million new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed, with 458,000 breast cancer related deaths &lt;ref name=&quot;Sainsbury&quot;&gt;Sainsbury, R. (2013). The Development of Endocrine Therapy for Women with Breast Cancer. 39(5).&lt;/ref&gt;. While breast cancer predominantly effects the female population, males are also susceptible, with 1500 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States alone &lt;ref&gt;Giordano, S. H., Buzdar, A. U., &amp; Hortobagyi, G. N. (2002). Breast Cancer in Men. 137(8).&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Risk Factors for Breast Cancer ==
While it is hard to decipher the exact cause of breast cancer, there are a number of risk factors associated with breast cancer development. It has been suggested that the incidence of breast cancer increases with age, with incidence rates doubling about every 10 years through until around the age of 50 when menopause occurs, following menopause, the rate increase substantially slows &lt;ref&gt;McPherson, K., Steel, C. M., &amp; Dixon, J. M. (2000). Breast Cancer - Epidemiology, Risk Factors and Genetics. 321(7270).&lt;/ref&gt;. Family history also plays a role in increased risk factors for breast cancer. Research suggests breast cancer risk was significantly greater for women with first-degree relatives with breast cancer.  This risk factor also increased with the number of first degree relatives whom had breast cancer &lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;&gt;Nelson, H. D., Zakher, B., Cantor, A., Fu, R., Griffin, J., O'Meara, E., &amp; et. al. (2012). Risk Factors for Breast Cancer for Women Aged 40 to 49 years. 156(9).&lt;/ref&gt;. Additional personal risk factors for breast cancer include race, ethnicity, BMI, physical activity, alcohol use and smoking &lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;.

== Common Treatments and Interventions ==
Among the most common, successful treatments for breast cancer is radiation therapy and hormone control. The use of breast conserving treatment, which includes a partial mastectomy and radiation therapy on residual breast tissue, as an alternative for a full mastectomy for early-stage breast cancer has increased due largely to its cosmetic results &lt;ref&gt;Shimozuma, K., Ganz, P. A., Petersen, L., &amp; Hirji, K. (1999). Quality of Life in the First Year After Breast Cancer Surgery: Rehabilitation Needs and Patterns of Recovery. 56(1).&lt;/ref&gt;. Multiple high-quality randomized trials has demonstrated the use of radiation therapy to play a crucial role in supporting breast conservation, enhancing local-regional control and improving the chance of survival, with approximately 120,000 breast cancer patients treated with radiation annually &lt;ref&gt;Smith, B. D., Pan, I.-W., Shih, Y.-C. T., Smith, G. L., Farris, J. R., Punglia, R., &amp; et.al. (2011). Adoption of Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer in the United States. 103(10).&lt;/ref&gt;.

The development and implementation of diverse selective endocrine therapies has led a shift from ablative surgery and chemotherapy to a more targeted, less aggressive form of breast cancer treatment. The endocrine therapies have reportedly been better tolerated and have improved both quality of life and mortality in patients suffering from hormone-responsive disease &lt;ref name=&quot;Sainsbury&quot;/&gt;. 

The use of diet and exercise interventions for breast cancer survivors helps to promote a healthy lifestyle. These interventions are commonly aimed at increasing levels of daily physical activity, fruit and vegetable intake and the levels of healthy lifestyle practices. Diet and exercise interventions have proven to reduce co-morbidities in cancer survivors and can protect against the recurrence of cancer-specific mortality &lt;ref&gt;Denmark-Wahnefried, W., Clipp, E. C., Lipkus, I. M., Lobach, D., Clutter Snyder, D., Sloane, R., &amp; et.al. (2007).

Myotonic Dystrophy differs from other forms of muscular dystrophies as it is associated with a number of other disorders including myotonia (delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction), endocrine changes , cataracts and heart conduction defects. There are two forms of myotonic dystrophy, including DM1 (type 1) and DM2 (type 2), both inherited but affecting a different gene.&lt;ref&gt;Genetic Home Reference. 2010. What is myotonic dystrophy?. [ONLINE] Available at: http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/myotonic-dystrophy. [Accessed 29 September 14].&lt;/ref&gt;.   

=== Symptoms &lt;ref&gt;Muscular Dystrophy Australia. 2013. MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY . [ONLINE] Available at: http://www.mda.org.au/disorders/dystrophies/myt.asp.&lt;/ref&gt;. === 
Symptoms may occur from birth onwards but as the disease is slow progressing, it isn't usually till adulthood until signs are present.  One of the first signs of myotonic dystrophy is muscle stiffness caused from myotonia.  Other symptoms may include heart problems, breathing troubles, difficulty swallowing, excessive tiredness and digestive problems. Hormonal problems are also often related to the disease and may include reproductive abnormalities, diabetes and thyroid dysfunction . 

=== Cause &lt;ref&gt;Up to Date . 2013. Myotonic dystrophy: Prognosis and management. Available at: http://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-prognosis-and-management.&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Myotonic Dystrophy is caused by a genetic mutation of the DMPK gene found on chromosome 19. The DMPK gene contains an area where the three building blocks of DNA, CTG and genetic material are repeated. A normal gene will contain 5-35 repeats CTC repeats but an individual with Myotonic Dystrophy will have anywhere from 50 to 10,000 depending on the severity of the case.

== The effects of high resistance training &lt;ref&gt;Tollba¨ck, A.,  Eriksson, S., Wredenberg, A.,  Jenner, G., Vargas, R., Borg, K., and Ansved, T. (1999) EFFECTS OF HIGH RESISTANCE TRAINING IN PATIENTS WITH MYOTONIC DYSTROPHY 31: 9–16&lt;/ref&gt; ==
* Although their is minimal research surrounding the effect of resistance training in myotonic dystrophy patients. There is evidence to suggest a patient with DM can benefit from resistance training with no side effects. 

* A study from the Departments of Neurology and Radiation Physics at the Karolinska Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden illustrated that although Resistance training will have no effect on isokinetic concentric and eccentric torque values, it can increase the muscular strength in patients suffering from myotonic dystrophy. 

* The same study found not only can resistance training increase muscular strength it can also prevent atrophy of the muscle and in some cases even promote hypertrophy in type 1 muscle fibers. 

* An increase in muscular strength and size in patients with DM means diminishing of symptoms including muscular pain, myotonia and balance, allowing patients to move more freely and improve their overall wellbeing. &lt;ref&gt;Wiles CM, Busse ME, Sampson CM, et al. Falls and stumbles in myotonic dystrophy. J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2006; 77:393.&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Although high intensity resistance training may benefit some patients, depending on the severity of the disease some patients may have no training potential.

== High Intensity Resistance Training &lt;ref&gt;18.Voet NB, van der Kooi EL, Riphagen II, et al. Strength training and aerobic exercise training for muscle disease. Cochrane Database Syst Rev 2013; 7:CD003907.&lt;/ref&gt;==
High intensity resistance training involves the combination of both training for strength and hypertrophy. The following table gives a basic guideline on training protocol. 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Rep Range !!Percent of 1 Rep Max  !! Muscular Changes
|-
| 1-5 Reps ||  85-100% || Strength
|-
| 9-12 Reps || 70-75% || Hypertrophy
|}

A high intensity resistance training program involves using this guideline, targeting each muscle group twice a week.

&lt;!-- Please add categories to the bottom of this page, and add interwikis to Wikidata. --&gt;
{{TRS-underconstruction|NEW=this page is the '''old original template basic usage''' sans updates. Many new modes were added last night as well as preliminary integration of Page to Page navigation logic. These options will be put up soon, time permitting&amp;mdash;right after proof of concept and debugging of the page to page navigation in {{tl|TRS-hdrbox}} (subtemplate) has been validated.}}
=== Usage ===
;Purpose
:This template is used with {{Tl|FUN-bot}} to set off Trainz Beginner oriented and organized Wiki pages from intermediate, or advanced topics, and ''[[:category:Trainz reference pages|Trainz reference classed topics]]'' on the Wiki. It is a multipurpose template used on many pages of the Trainz Wikibook.
;Parameters and their effects
  
* The ''''''hold'''' parameter'' can be used to suppress the assertion of the {{tl|beginner links}} table and auto-TOCright.
:* Similarly, defining the named parameter ''''no''' to any value totally suppresses the beginner links, which merges the same controls across several header templates.
* It will not auto-categorize the page to the [[:category:Trainz fundamentals pages]], you must use {{Tl|FUN-bot}} to do that, which may be modified on this wiki to do page navigation.

* It can be given the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{noTOC}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter to suppress the automatic assertion of {{tl|TOCright}} moving the Table of Contents to the left margin in the default position. 

&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{TRS-warning|As of closing this /doc page edit, the below examples aren't all displaying what is expected, or meant. We still have a bit of message and or {{BL|priority evaluation debugging to do}} now that the template logic nests properly, albeit with some ordering or message line issues! {{BL|BUT! Not too bad for a Beta test!}}
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt; '''Exercise for reducing the risk of stroke''' &lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

=== Background- What is a stroke? ===
A stroke is a brain attack which blocks off the blood flow that carries oxygen and nutrients to brain tissue&lt;ref name =&quot;National STROKE Association&quot;&gt;National STROKE Association. (2013). &lt;http://www.stroke.org/site/DocServer/STROKE_101_Fact_Sheet.pdf?docID=4541&gt; [Accessed: 29/09/14].&lt;/ref&gt;. When deprived of this blood supply two million brain cells die every minute, every moment increasing the risk of permanent brain damage, disability or death&lt;ref name= &quot;Mayo Clinic&quot;&gt; Mayo Clinic Staff. Mayo Clinic. (2014). &lt;http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/stroke/basics/definition/con-20042884&gt; [Accessed: 29/09/14]. &lt;/ref&gt;. 

==== What are the different types of stroke? ====

# Ischemic stroke – This is the most common type of stroke accounting for 87% of stokes suffered. Ischemic stroke occurs when a blood clot or fatty deposit (i.e. plaque, atheroma) block the arteries&lt;ref name=&quot;National STROKE Association&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heart foundation&quot;&gt; Heart Foundation. (2014). &lt;http://www.heartfoundation.org.au&gt; [Accessed: 29/09/14].&lt;/ref&gt;. 
# Hemorrhagic stroke – This is only responsible for 13% of all strokes, however, is more fatal accounting for 30% of all stroke deaths. Hemorrhagic strokes occur when a blood vessel in the brain bursts and leaks blood into the brain &lt;ref name= &quot;National STROKE Association&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Heart foundation&quot;/&gt;. This is typically as result of high blood pressure and/or diseases involving the blood vessels in your brain.
# Transient ischemic attacks [TIA] – these are also known as ‘mini strokes’. These are a major precursor for strokes as 40% who suffer a TIA will go on to have a stroke&lt;ref name= &quot;National STROKE Association&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Heart foundation&quot;/&gt;. As you age, risk of suffering a TIA increases&lt;ref name= &quot;National STROKE Association&quot;/&gt;.

==== What are some risk factors for stroke?&lt;ref name= &quot;National STROKE Association&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Heart foundation&quot;/&gt;  ====
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Medical risk factors !! Lifestyle risk factors&lt;ref&gt;Shinton, R. Lifelong exposures and the potential for stroke prevention: the contribution of cigarette smoking, exercise, and body fat. Epidemiology and community health. 1997; 51:138-143.&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Suffered a stroke before || Smoking
|-
| Suffered a TIA before || Being overweight
|-
| High cholesterol || Excess alcohol consumption
|-
| High blood pressure || High sodium diet

|-
| Carotid artery disease&lt;ref name= &quot;Gordan, N.F.&quot;/&gt; || 
|-
|}

Strokes are not biased to age, sex, or race, and so everyone has a stroke risk&lt;ref name= &quot;National STROKE Association&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Heart foundation&quot;/&gt;. Some factors do increase an individual’s risk. Those over 55 years of age have an increased risk&lt;ref name= &quot;National STROKE Association&quot;/&gt;. Men when they are younger have a greater risk than women, but as women age they are more at risk, especially to fatality as result of stroke&lt;ref name= &quot;National STROKE Association&quot;/&gt;. African Americans have an increased stroke risk as do diabetics and those with a family history of stroke&lt;ref name= &quot;National STROKE Association&quot;/&gt;. But no matter the number of factors someone has, everyone should do what they can to minimise their risk factors.

=== What benefits will I see from exercise?&lt;ref name= &quot;Heart foundation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;Gordan, N.F.&quot;/&gt; ===

Up to 80% of all strokes are avoidable. This is because most strokes occur as result of unhealthy lifestyle choices.

=== Recommendations for Exercise ===

Simply by meeting the daily recommended physical activity guidelines, stroke risk can be dramatically decreased&lt;ref&gt;Australian Government Department of Health. (2014). &lt;http://www.health.gov.au/internet/main/publishing.nsf/content/health-pubhlth-strateg-phys-act-guidelines&gt; [Accessed: 29/09/14].&lt;/ref&gt;. More specific exercise programs can be prescribed to cater for individual medications, disabilities, requirements and so forth.

Exercise not only lowers the risk factors of having a stroke, it also minimises the disability of someone who has had a stroke and improves their quality of life. Exercise in a stroke survivor prevents complications of prolonged inactivity, decreases risk of recurrent stroke and cardiovascular events, increases aerobic fitness and enhances psychological functioning including concentration, memory and so on&lt;ref name= &quot;Gordan, N.F.&quot;/&gt;.

==== Guidelines you should know before getting started ====
If you are on and medications to lower blood pressure, cholesterol or any other health risks it is crucial that you see your doctor before participating in any exercise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background ==
=== ''Prevalence'' ===
Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is prevalent in society at 6.4% of the population of Australia &lt;ref&gt;Australian Bureau Of Statistics (2007). National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing. Canberra, Australia.&lt;/ref&gt;. When this is compared to those in the military it is higher, believed to be between 7-16% &lt;ref&gt;Richardson, L. K., Frueh, B. C., &amp; Acierno, R. (2010). Prevalence estimates of combat-related post-traumatic stress disorder: critical review. Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 44(1), 4-19.&lt;/ref&gt;.
Sedentary behavior within the military is unlikely to occur due to the values it places on being physically fit and active &lt;ref&gt;Messinger, S. D. (2010). Getting Past the Accident. Medical anthropology quarterly, 24(3), 281-303.&lt;/ref&gt;. It is suggested that as rank increases, the amount of time spent sedentary increases posing future health risks &lt;ref&gt;Kennedy-Armbruster, C., Evans, E. M., Sexauer, L., Peterson, J., &amp; Wyatt, W. (2013). Association among functional-movement ability, fatigue, sedentary time, and fitness in 40 years and older active duty military personnel. Military medicine, 178(12), 1358-1364.&lt;/ref&gt;.
=== ''What is PTSD'' ===
PTSD is a heightened state of stress and anxiety on an individual due to the occurrence of a traumatic event, such as combat or a car accident &lt;ref&gt;Walker, S. (2010). Assessing the mental health consequences of military combat in Iraq and Afghanistan: a literature review. Journal of psychiatric and mental health nursing, 17(9), 790-796.&lt;/ref&gt;.
=== ''What is sedentary behavior'' ===
Sedentary behavior is a distinctive set of behaviours which are shown by having little physical activity and a low energy expenditure &lt;ref&gt;Chinapaw, M. J. M., Proper, K. I., Brug, J., Van Mechelen, W., &amp; Singh, A. S. (2011). Relationship between young peoples' sedentary behaviour and biomedical health indicators: a systematic review of prospective studies. Obesity Reviews, 12(7), 621-632.&lt;/ref&gt;.
== Effects on health ==
Sedentary behavior leads to the following:&lt;ref&gt;Proper, K. I., Singh, A. S., Van Mechelen, W., &amp; Chinapaw, M. J. (2011). Sedentary behaviors and health outcomes among adults: a systematic review of prospective studies. American journal of preventive medicine, 40(2), 174-182.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Body weight/BMI gain
* Being overweight/obese
* Waist gain
* Type 2 diabetes
* Cardiovascular disease risk
* Endometrial factors
* Mortality due to cardiovascular disease and cancer 
PTSD often leads to sedentary behavior despite the known benefits of physical activity on both physical and mental self &lt;ref&gt;Rosenbaum, S., Tiedemann, A., Sherrington, C., &amp; van der Ploeg, H. P. (2014). Assessing physical activity in people with posttraumatic stress disorder: feasibility and concurrent validity of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire-short form and actigraph accelerometers. BMC research notes, 7(1), 576.&lt;/ref&gt;. When someone suffers PTSD they are known to go into isolation and resort from performing physical activity
== Current interventions ==
=== ''PTSD''&lt;ref&gt;Imel, Z. E., Laska, K., Jakupcak, M., &amp; Simpson, T. L. (2013). Meta-analysis of dropout in treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder. Journal Of Consulting And Clinical Psychology, 81(3), 394-404&lt;/ref&gt; === 
* Exercise/physical activity
* CBT
* Exposure therapy
* Hypnotherapy
* Trauma desensitization
* Relapse prevention therapy
* Interpersonal therapy
* Pharmacotherapy
=== ''Sedentary behavior'' ===
Public health stance is to currently increase physical activity with little reference to decreasing the amount of sitting/screen time&lt;ref&gt;Dunstan, D. W., &amp; Owen, N. (2012). New exercise prescription: don't just sit there: stand up and move more, more often: comment on “sitting time and all-cause mortality risk in 222 497 Australian adults”. Archives of internal medicine, 172(6), 500-501.&lt;/ref&gt;
== Exercise benefits on health ==
Exercise for PTSD sufferers looks to offer a distraction, taking the mind off of the symptoms, elevate mood levels, decrease anxiety&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, G.E. &amp; Shamus, E. (2009). Depressed, low self-Esteem: What can exercise do for you? The Internet Journal of Allied Health Sciences and Practice, 7(2).&lt;/ref&gt; and act as a stress buffer&lt;ref&gt;Tsatsoulis, A. &amp; Fountoulakis, S. (2006). The protective role of exercise on stress system dysregulation and comorbidities. Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 1083, 196-213.&lt;/ref&gt;. Aerobic exercise has been shown to be beneficial&lt;ref&gt;Fetzner, M. G., &amp; Asmundson, G. J. (2014). Aerobic exercise reduces symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized controlled trial. Cognitive behaviour therapy, (ahead-of-print), 1-13.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as taking part in exercise with groups is shown to have greater effects.

Exercise to physical health helps to overcome many of the problems which are caused by sedentary behaviour.
== Exercise recommendations for improving health ==
Research has shown that there is no difference between high intensity, moderate intensity and low intensity exercise in helping combat veterans suffering PTSD&lt;ref&gt;Stanton, R., &amp; Reaburn, P. (2014). Exercise and the treatment of depression: a review of the exercise program variables. Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport, 17(2), 177-182.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus by meeting the physical activity guidelines for Australia would be enough to help.
Physical activity guidelines for Australia:
* Accumulate 150-300 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity or 75-150 minutes of vigorous physical activity, or an equivalent combination of both each week.
* Perform muscle strength training activities on at least 2 days a week.
* Be active on most, preferably all days of the week
Sedentary behavior guidelines:
* Minimize the amount of time spent sitting
* Break up long periods of sitting as often as possible
As the military has a history of being physically active, by once again becoming physically active will become a saving grace for not only their physical self, but also their mental self  as they will return to do something they were once passionate about. It will also improve their health as they will not be sedentary any longer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Dr. Muduly. Thank you for your many wonderful contributions to the [[Radiation Oncology]] wikibook. We're grateful for your contributions. Just for your information, you don't need to feel compelled to track every edit you've made on the [[Radiation Oncology/Authors|Authors]] page.  The edit counts on that page are deprecated (last updated: July 2010). There are now much easier tools available for keeping track of edits, tools that didn't exist when we first created the wikibook.  It's much easier to make use of these tools rather than to keep track of the edit count manually, so we don't worry about it any more.  However, if you find it useful to do so, there's no problem.  I just didn't want you to feel that you needed to do it.  Cheers! &amp;mdash; [[User:Brim|Brim]] ([[User talk:Brim|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Brim|contribs]]) 00:56, 22 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

{{TRS-hdrbox}}
;Purpose and usage
&lt;/div&gt;
This template inserts the code appearing above the box message in style statements on the background color shown in this section in the Trainz header templates for a &lt;code&gt;uniform page&lt;/code&gt; appearance. &lt;/div&gt;
* It has no options and takes no arguments; Use by placing inline inside the double quotes of the header template &amp;lt;div style=&quot; ... &quot;&amp;gt; statement beginning each page.
;Notes during workup

;Final Color of choice du jour: #F7FCFA; (#F9FFFA close, but too light to show code tags well enough! Ditto #F9FCFA;)
&amp;nbsp;
;(eventually) replacing #FFF8DC; aka Cornsilk --- too dk green=#D8F8DC closer, but a bit too off yellow-greenish #DEFFDC; not sickly, but ... eh!
... most any of these would be better choices: (X11 colors from [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_colors Wikipedia])
 White 	FF FF FF 	255 255 255
 Snow 	FF FA FA 	255 250 250
 Honeydew 	F0 FF F0 	240 255 240

 GhostWhite 	F8 F8 FF 	248 248 255
 WhiteSmoke 	F5 F5 F5 	245 245 245
consider trying blends with

&lt;!-- Please add categories to the bottom of this page, and add interwikis to Wikidata. --&gt;
;Purpose &amp;mdash;this page is used in pairs with the above type template to style link and, in the case of this template, properly group articles into autocategories if given the same switches as the header template.
== Usage ==

;Purpose
:This template is used with {{Tl|FUN-top}} to set off Trainz Beginner oriented and organized Wiki pages from intermediate topics, content creation, and ''[[:category:Trainz references|Trainz reference classed topics]]'' on the Wiki.
&lt;/div&gt;
* It will also auto-categorize the page to the [[:category:Trainz fundamentals pages]], or with divisions, Introductory pages depending upon page counts to be determined by article counts. The provisional controls ID, IR, IS, IT, and TBKR should be defined the same as any page header and if auto-categorization is needed, the presence of these switches will gate any new subcategories. 
&amp;nbsp;
:* Given any of the above, currently they act as if defining the parameter 'IT', so the pages are therefore auto-categorized into [[:category:Introductory Trainz]] instead of {{lc|Trainz fundamentals pages}}.
&amp;nbsp;
:* Parameter 'ref2' or 'both' also asserts the auto-[[:category: Trainz references]] for use on pages like how to set up Trainz topics, that have a valid life in appendices or references as well.

&amp;nbsp;
* It can be given the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; default parameter to alter the sort order of the reference page as listed in that category.

==Bumping Priorities==
;&lt;big&gt;Taking control of your Computer's resources&lt;/big&gt;
:''This article is about tweaking Windows when you are asking Trainz to work at long tasks in the background, while you work in a foreground process.''

The trigger for this tutorial about a power user technique was the {{TA|Cross-loading JA and libraries}} HowTo page with the recommendation that once JA's are accepted into a Trainz release, it is best to attempt to root out various incompatibility situations, mainly those involving scripting and the occasional shift in KIND mapping to the script libraries before they ambush you. This requires a systematic re-validation route by route beginning with a set of sessions and the route, built up into a large comprehensive list of dependencies.

It was suggested, this operation is one where the user might want to proceed with undemanding foreground tasks, and let CM chunk away re-validating assets a screenful or two at a time.

== What is Obstructive Sleep Apnea ==
Apnea is defined as a ‘cessation of breath’ for at least 10 seconds&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawati&quot;/&gt;. Obstructive Sleep Apnea(OSA) also called Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome(OSAS) is the most common form of sleep apnea, affecting 9% of middle aged men and 4% of women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawati&quot;/&gt; It occurs when there are repeated episodes of complete or partial blockage of the upper airway during sleep. During a sleep apnea episode the diaphragm and chest muscles work harder to open the obstructed airway (that is blocked by the collapse or narrowing of the soft tissue) so air can flow to the lungs. Breathing resumes with a loud gasp, snort or body jerk. These episodes interfere with sleep patterns, can reduce the flow of oxygen to vital organs, and cause irregular heart rhythms.&lt;ref name=&quot;name it&quot;&gt;Understanding Obstructive Sleep Apnea, 2005-2014. WebMD&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Obstructive sleep apnea event.tif|thumbnail|right|Blocked airway in Obstructive sleep apnea]]
== Signs &amp; Symptoms&lt;ref name=&quot;name it&quot;/&gt; ==
*Daytime sleepiness or fatigue
*Dry mouth or sore throat upon awakening
*Headaches in the morning
*Trouble concentrating, forgetfulness, depression, or irritability
*Night sweats
*Restlessness during sleep
*Sexual dysfunction
*Snoring
*Sudden awakenings with a sensation of gasping or choking
*Difficulty getting up in the mornings 
==Risk Factors==
===Obesity===
Obesity and indicators for central obesity, such as neck circumference, is one of the main risk factors for developing OSA. Ways in which obesity predisposes to OSA include: 
*Narrowing of upper airway
*Alterations in upper airway function
* Reductions in lung volume
Studies have shown the a 10% in weight was associated to a 6-fold increase in risk for developing OSA &lt;ref name=&quot;Peppard&quot;&gt;Peppard T, Young M, (2000)'Longitudinal study of moderate weight change and sleep-disordered breathing'pp. 3015–3021&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Risk Factors===
*Gender - men have twice the risk of developing OSA. This could be due to upper airway fat deposition, larger amounts of soft tissue in the upper airways and hormones are believed to play a role. &lt;ref name=&quot;Peppard&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lawati&quot;/&gt;
*Ethnicity - African Americans and Asians appear to be at a greater risk
*Family history/genetics - The risk of OSA in an individual rises with the increasing number of affected relatives &lt;ref name=&quot;Redline&quot;&gt; Redline S, Tishler P &amp; Tosteson P. 'The familial aggregation of obstructive sleep apnea'
Am J Respir Crit Care Med, 151 (3 Pt 1) (1995), pp. 682–687&lt;/ref&gt;
*Nasal obstruction - Increases risk of OSA through the increased negative upper airway pressure produced by inspiratory efforts against a partially occluded nasal airway, turbulence, nasal reflexes, and snoring causing damage/edema to the upper airway soft tissues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mirza&quot;&gt; Mirza N &amp; Lanza D. 'The nasal airway and obstructed breathing during sleep'. 32 (1999), pp. 243–262&lt;/ref&gt;
*Alcohol - Relaxes the upper airway and may induce OSA on healthy people or chronic snores. And increases the duration and frequency of episodes in those who suffer OSA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scanlan&quot;&gt; Scalan M, Roebuck T &amp; Little P. 'Effect of moderate alcohol upon obstructive sleep apnea'.6 (2000), pp. 909–913&lt;/ref&gt;
*Smoking - Increase risk could be due to smoking-related airway inflammation and interference in sleep. &lt;ref name=&quot;Kashyap&quot;&gt; Kashyap R, Hock L, Bowman T.'Higher prevalence of smoking in patients diagnosed as having obstructive sleep apnea'Sleep Breath, 4 (2001), pp. 167–172&lt;/ref&gt;
Underlying diseases such as hyperthyriodism and acromegaly and structural abnormalities have also been identified as risk factors.

==Long Term Effects==
*Cardiovascular disease &lt;ref name=&quot;Java&quot;&gt;Javaheri S, Parker TJ, Liming JD, Corbett WS, Nishiyama H, Wexler L &amp; Roselle GA, (1998) 'Sleep apnea in 81 ambulatory male patients with stable heart failure. Types and their prevalences, consequences, and presentations'. PubMed 2;97(21):2154-9.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Gunnarsson SI, Peppard PE, Korcarz CE, Barnet JH, Aeschlimann SE, Hagen EW, Young T, Hla KM &amp; Stein JH, (2014) 'Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with future subclinical carotid artery disease: thirteen-year follow-up from the wisconsin sleep cohort'. PubMed (10):2338-42. doi: 10.1161/ATVBAHA.114.303965.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Heart failure &lt;ref&gt;Peppard PE, Young T, Palta M &amp; Skatrud J, (2000) 'Prospective study of the association between sleep-disordered breathing and hypertension.'PubMed 342(19):1378-84. doi: 10.1056/NEJM200005113421901 &lt;/ref&gt;
*Cardiac arrhythmias &lt;ref&gt; Gami AS1, Pressman G, Caples SM, Kanagala R, Gard JJ, Davison DE, Malouf JF, Ammash NM, Friedman PA &amp; Somers VK, (2004) 'Association of atrial fibrillation and obstructive sleep apnea.'Pubmed 110: 364-367 doi: 10.1161/01.CIR.0000136587.68725.8E. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Java&quot;/&gt;
*Premature death &lt;ref name=&quot;Lawati&quot;&gt; Lawati A, Patel S, Ayas N. (2009) 'Epidemiology, risk factors, and consequences of obstructive sleep apnea and short sleep duration.'51(4):285-93. doi: 10.1016/j.pcad.2008.08.001.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Development of diabetes &lt;ref name =&quot;Lawati&quot;/&gt;

==Treatment==
Common treatments used for OSA are Continuous Positive Airway Pressure(CPAP) and Mandibular advancement devices which pumps steams of air through a mask to hold open the airways. Avoiding alcohol and smoking is recommended and weight loss for those who are overweight&lt;ref&gt; Qaseem A, Holty J, Owens D, Dallas P, Starkey M, Shekelle P.(2013).'Management of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in Adults: A Clinical Practice Guideline From the American College of Physicians.'. Annals of Internal Medicine. doi:10.7326/0003-4819-159-7-201310010-00704. PMID 24061345&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Effects of aerobic Exercise==
Exercise has been shown to be an effective intervention and prevention strategy for OSA as it reduces both the cardiovascular risk factors like blood pressure and other comorbidities &lt;ref name=&quot;Roberto&quot;&gt; Silva R, Belli K, Carissmimi A, Fiori C, Faria C &amp; Martinez D. 'Are there benefits of exercise in sleep apnea?' Sleep sci2011;4(2):61-67
&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;wijen&quot;&gt;Wijnen H, Boothroyd C, Young MW, Claridge-Chang A. Molecular genetics of timing in intrinsic circadian rhythm sleep disorders. Ann Med. 2002;34:386–393&lt;/ref&gt;. Although it has not yet been found that exercise on its own would benefit OSA sufferers, research has shown that exercise should be used as an adjunct to primary treatment with CPAP&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberto&quot;/&gt;.
As regular aerobic exercise is associated with body weight maintenance, and at higher volumes weight loss, recommendations for increased frequent physical activity accompanying primary treatment from CPAP may be a way to increase energy expenditure and reduce secondary risk factors in OSA &lt;ref name=&quot;Roberto&quot;/&gt;.
Aerobic exercise training may reduce OSA severity &lt;ref name=&quot;kline&quot;&gt; Kline C, Crowley E, Ewing G, Burch J, Blair S, Durstine J, Davis J &amp; Youngstedt S (2013)'Blunted heart rate recovery is improved following exercise training in overweight adults with obstructive sleep apnea.'PubMed 167(4):1610-5. doi: 10.1016/j.ijcard.2012.04.108.&lt;/ref&gt;, improve exercise capacity and also improve daytime sleepiness &lt;ref name=&quot;linda&quot;&gt; Ueno L, Drager F, Rodrigues A, Rondon M, Braga A, Mathias W, Krieger E, Barretto A, Middlekauff H, Lorenzi-Filho G &amp; Negrão C. (2009) 'Effects of Exercise Training in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure and Sleep Apnea.' 32(5): 637–647.&lt;/ref&gt;, and improve quality of life and mood state.

==Recommendations==

&lt;H2&gt; Introduction &lt;/H2&gt;

&lt;H3&gt; What is Reddit? &lt;/H3&gt;
&lt;b&gt;[[wikipedia|Reddit]]&lt;/b&gt; is the self-proclaimed “front page of the internet”. It is an online forum where all content is provided by the users, called redditors. Redditors are characterized by only a username and the content they provide. There is no requirement for the redditor to incorporate any personal identifying information into their content or their username. Due to this, Reddit is largely a community of completely anonymous users that provide web content for each other.


Content on Reddit is supplied in the form of hyperlinks to external websites which may display images, text, or any general web content. Users also determine the visibility of content by voting the content either up or down. Content is divided into categories, called subreddits, which are maintained by redditors called moderators. Moderators are charged with guaranteeing that content on their subreddit is relevant and appropriate. Each subreddit typically has rules which content must satisfy in order to stay on the site. These lax restrictions on content coupled with the anonymity of the users makes reddit a unique social space worthy of investigation. &lt;ref&gt; How reddit works. (2014, October 13). Retrieved October 13, 2014, from [http://www.redditblog.com/2014/07/how-reddit-works.html] &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;H3&gt; History &lt;/H3&gt;
Reddit was started in 2005 by University of Virginia graduates Alex Ohanian and Steve Huffman. Y Combinator, an American seed accelerator, provided the initial funding. Code Nast, a mass media company, acquired Reddit in 2006 which skyrocketed the popularity of the site to 500,000 unique daily visitors on average. In 2008, Reddit became open source and allowed users to create their own subreddits. As of September 2011, the site averaged 1.6 million views a month. &lt;ref&gt; A rundown of Reddit’s history and community. (2014, October 11). Retrieved October 19, 2014, from [http://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2011/10/14/a-rundown-of-reddits-history-and-community-infographic/] &lt;/ref&gt;

Several events allowed for the mass popularity of Reddit. Stephen Colbert launched his &quot;Restoring Truthiness&quot; campaign in response to Glen Beck's &quot;Restoring Honor&quot; rally. Colbert's campaign raised over $600,000 for Donors Choose. &lt;ref&gt; A rundown of Reddit’s history and community. (2014, October 11).

&lt;font size=3&gt;
* Since 2006 when the country gained independence after the dissolution of Yugoslavia one meter stamp has been reported, a digital stamp used in post offices.
* The stamp is inscribed &quot;'''Crna Gora'''&quot; which is the native name in the Montenegrin (and Macedonian) language.
&lt;/font&gt;

;Purpose and usage
This page is common boilerplate for redirect templates. To use, include the template in a See Also section at page bottom of the documentation.
* It has one control switch parameter ''''brief'''', which when defined presents a tighter shorter list of the same links.
{{typeTaid}}{{selfTdoc}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;{{#if:{{{brief|}}}|
* [[Template:R from TRS-alt]] &amp; [[Template:R to TRS-alt]] are more easily typed and remembered (mnemonic names) {{nowrap|of [[Template:R from Trainz alternative name]].}}
* [[Template:R to TRS-AM&amp;C]] - Pages relocated to [[:category:Trainz AM&amp;C|Trainz AM&amp;C]] division pages.
* [[Template:R to TRS-CC]] - Pages relocated to [[:Category:Trainz Content Creation]] division pages.
* [[Template:R to TRS-ref]] - Pages relocated to [[:Category:redirects to Trainz reference pages]] division pages.
* [[Template:R to TRS-ver]] - Pages redirecting short colloquial usages for Trainz versions 
* [[Template:R to TRS-sect]] - for when the redirect is a searchable title, but topic coverage is ''''section title'''' of a page.
* [[Template:R from Trainz]] - auto-categorized Trainz Wikibooks redirect terms into the auto-Category: {{lc|redirects from Trainz pages}}. This was the original redirect template, whose use is now depreciated in favor of the most correct from the above list.
* [[Template:R from Trainz2]] - Page titles which should eventually be weeded as {{lc|Trainz false starts}}.
|
* [[Template:R from TRS-alt]] &amp; [[Template:R to TRS-alt]] more easily typed and remembered redirect forms of {{nowrap|[[Template:R from Trainz alternative name]] below.}}

* [[Template:R to TRS-AM&amp;C]] - Pages relocated to [[:category:Trainz AM&amp;C|Trainz AM&amp;C]] division pages.

* [[Template:R to TRS-CC]] - Pages relocated to [[:Category:Trainz Content Creation]] division pages.

* [[Template:R to TRS-ref]] - Pages relocated to [[:Category:redirects to Trainz reference pages]] division pages.

* [[Template:R to TRS-ver]] - Pages redirecting short colloquial usages for Trainz versions to formally named release page about the product.

*  [[Template:R to TRS-sect]] - for when the redirect is a searchable title, but topic coverage is in the section of a page.

;forms somewhat or wholly depreciated
*  [[Template:R from Trainz alternative name]] - for pages which have been given 'better' (more searchable) names or aliased for easing searching. This is used for page aliased names where both are in the Trainz/subpage_name form, or the page is a general knowledge page that does not neatly fall into a book division such as AM&amp;C, references, etcetera, versus target pages where the text is a subpage of those divisions.
&amp;nbsp;
* [[Template:R from Trainz]] - auto-categorized Trainz Wikibooks redirect terms into the auto-Category: {{lc|redirects from Trainz pages}}. This was the original redirect template, whose use is now depreciated in favor of the most correct from the above list.
&amp;nbsp;
* [[Template:R from Trainz2]] - This template is used on redirect pages to eventually be deleted, that were ear-marked as split offs into a separate volume, now figured to be a false start... and gained nothing important but more complexity. Maintenance and redirects Auto-category is {{lc|Trainz false starts}}.
&lt;div&gt; &amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
}}&lt;!-- endif 'brief' ---&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;[[category:Trainz redirect templates|$]]

[[category:Trainz redirect pages]]
{{AutoTcat}}
{{Trainz-cat|noMaint=1|1=This category holds only auto-categorizing template tools which present a boilerplate message and are used to auto-categorize various groups of titles which are redirect pages.
{{Trainz-admin|noAdmin=1}}
&lt;div style={{TRS-style|box=1}}&gt;
{{Trainz-redirect templates|brief=1}}
&lt;/div&gt;
{{template category}}
In general, these templates are placed on the same line as the redirect command, or the auto-category will not work.
:Contributors should visit [[Trainz/Project]] and/or [[Trainz/Templates]] pages to familiarize yourself with the toolbox.
* These are all {{lc|Auto-categorizing templates}}, and that status is implicit in being included in THIS category.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm a third year University student from Canberra. I'm studying a Bachelor of Sport, Coaching and Exercise Science.

== Background ==
I moved to Canberra in 2000 and quickly got involved in the sporting side of the ACT. In year 12 I decided I couldn't see myself working anywhere other than in the sporting world.

== Interests ==
My biggest interest is sport. My chosen sport is netball and I've been playing for 13 years now. I also enjoy playing touch football occasionally. I passionately follow AFL and my dream job is working with my favourite club.
I also model on the side of study and part time work.

== Wikibooks Project ==

One of my assignments this year is to create a wiki page relating to exercise and its effect on a chosen disease.

== What is Anxiety? ==

It is important to understand that anxiety effects people in different ways. However, central features often include excessive worrying, a negative thought process, distress for unknown reason, and feeling uncomfortable due to the thought that something bad is going to occur. Normal everyday stress is not unusual, it is the body's natural way of reacting to stressful situations and pressure. Anxiety is when the feelings of distress, worry, and feeling uncomfortable or 'on edge' are experienced for prolonged amounts of time.&lt;ref&gt; Understanding and Managing Anxiety, Available From: http://www.psychology.org.au/publications/tip_sheets/anxiety/ &lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms ==

Symptoms of anxiety can include:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| Sweating || Trembling or Shaking || Restlessness
|-
| Irritability || Racing Heart Rate || Confusion
|-
| Tightening of Chest || Hot and Cold Flushes || Trouble Sleeping
|-
| Trouble Concentrating || Upset Stomach or Nausea || &lt;ref&gt; Signs and Symptoms, Available From: http://www.beyondblue.org.au/the-facts/anxiety/signs-and-symptoms &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; Understanding and Managing Anxiety, Available From: http://www.psychology.org.au/publications/tip_sheets/anxiety/ &lt;/ref&gt;
|} 

The effects of anxiety can prevent a person from living a normal, happy life if the anxiety is not recognised and managed.

== Who is at risk of suffering from Anxiety? ==

Anxiety can effect anyone of any age and gender. In Australia, anxiety is the most common mental condition, effecting on average, 1 in 4 people. This adds up to over 2 million people in one year. &lt;ref&gt; The Facts, Available From: http://www.beyondblue.org.au/the-facts &lt;/ref&gt; Whilst no one can be certain they will never have anxiety, there are a few factors that could make a person more susceptible to suffering from anxiety.

=== Factors that could increase risk of Anxiety===

* Hereditary: Family history of anxiety
* Biochemical Factors: An imbalance of emotion regulation and physical reaction chemicals in the brain
* Unpleasant Life Experiences: Abuse, bullying, excessive pressure, large work load &lt;ref&gt; Understanding and Managing Anxiety, Available From:http://www.psychology.org.au/publications/tip_sheets/anxiety/ &lt;/ref&gt;

== Exercise as a Management Tool ==

A lot of research has gone into finding ways to reduce anxiety symptoms; there are various medications and therapy available.&lt;ref&gt; Medication, Available From: http://www.adaa.org/finding-help/treatment/medication &lt;/ref&gt; It is well known that exercise is beneficial for ones physical health, but have you considered it could have a positive influence on your mental health as well. Research has now proven that &lt;big&gt;'''exercise'''&lt;/big&gt; can be an effective way of reducing the symptoms of anxiety. &quot;We now have evidence to support the claim that exercise is related to positive mental health as indicated by relief in symptoms of depression and anxiety.&quot; (Landers, 1997) Exercise produces endorphins in the brain which act as the body's natural painkillers; they help boost your overall mood. Exercise is said to produce a sense of euphoria and reduce overall stress.&lt;ref&gt; Exercise and Endorphins, Available From: http://www.naturaltherapypages.com.au/article/Exercise_Endorphins &lt;/ref&gt;

The results of exercise as a management tool for anxiety can vary for each individual, just as anxiety effects each person differently. Some people find instant relief after exercising, others will experience gradual relief, some people will have temporary relief and others will have long term management of their anxiety.

=== What type of exercise is best? ===

Research suggests that aerobic exercise is more beneficial in reducing anxiety.&lt;ref&gt; Exercise and Endorphins, Available From: http://www.naturaltherapypages.com.au/article/Exercise_Endorphins &lt;/ref&gt; This includes activities such as jogging, cycling and swimming. Exercise as a management tool for anxiety is said to also be more effective when exercise is regular over a few weeks opposed to a one off occurrence. &lt;ref&gt; The influence of Exercise on Mental Health, Available From: http://www.portalsaudebrasil.com/artigospsb/psico046.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; However, some individuals may still benefit from strength exercises as well as more relaxing exercises such as yoga. Some people may just need a brisk walk around the block to de-stress.

== Recommendations ==

Based on the information above, aerobic exercise as a management tool for anxiety would be the best place to start.
This includes exercises such as:
* Running
* Jogging
* Walking
* Cycling
* Swimming
These types of exercise all increase heart rate and release feel good endorphins. Other types of anxiety management exercises include: Strength training, Yoga and Pilaties. Each person is different and will react differently to various exercises. Don't hesitate to ''contact a professional'' and ask them to discuss exercise options with you.

===WHAT IS CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME?===

=====Definition=====

Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is an “illness characterised by fatigue that occurs suddenly, improves and relapses. Bringing on delimitating tiredness or easy fatiguability in an individual who has no apparent reason for feeling this way’.’’ 
=====Clinical Diagnosis=====

“Cases of unexplained Chronic Fatigue can be defined if they meet both of the following criteria:

1. Clinically evaluated, unexplained persistent or relapsing chronic fatigue of new or definite onset that:

** Is not the result of ongoing exertion;
** Is not substantially alleviated by stress; and
** Results in substantial reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social or personal activities; and

2. The concurrent occurrence of four or more of the following symptoms:

** Substantial impairment in short-term memory or concentration; 
** Sore throat;
** Tender lymph nodes;
** Muscle pain; 
** Multi-joint pain without swelling or redness; 
** Headaches of a new type;
** Sleep that is not refreshing.

These symptoms must have persisted or recurred during six or more consecutive months of illness and must have predated the fatigue”.

&lt;ref&gt;ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities&lt;/ref&gt;

===CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME AND EXERCISE===

It is of general knowledge that exercise proves to be a crucial ingredient in leading a healthy lifestyle and improves an individuals quality of life. Yet when debilitating fatigue strikes that affects all major bodily organs, the choice of eliminating physical activity from daily life proves to be a simple and common one. Research indicates that this is indeed the wrong choice and that physical activity should be both encouraged and completed despite symptoms such as headaches, balance and proprioception issues and bodily aches. This was proven by Sharpe and Wessely (1998) who stated that: “Graded exercise has shown effectiveness in CFS. Treatment should be gradual starting at a low level of exercise and increasing incrementally under controlled conditions”.

[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1297043/pdf/jrsocmed00013-0053.pdf Sharpe and Wessley (1998).]

====Relationship Complexity====

An underlying issue that exists between Chronic Fatigue and Exercise lies in the patients attitude and support systems. It has been noted that positive affects result when the individual feels supported by family members and peers, despite these people not fully understanding the severity of this persons illness nor the pain and frustration they feel. These psychological and emotional battles reinforce the need for regular physical activity to act as a stress reliever and distraction. 

A strong correlation exists between exercise and post-exertional dizziness via the vestibular system, this places a greater need upon the completion of exercise at intensities and frequencies that is at the participants discretion. The implementation and adherence to a graded exercise regime would prove to be the most beneficial. The monitoring of an individuals symptoms and their personal recording of their symptoms/general feeling is encouraged.

====Exercise Prescription for a CFS Patient====

The creation of an exercise regime for an individual with Chronic Fatigue should be based upon their daily symptoms. The major focus is upon getting the individual moving, despite the severity of symptoms. Exercise prescription should focus upon the functional capacity of the individual, including flexibility training and graded exercise therapy. The “monitoring of standard cardiovascular and ventilatory responses, (electrocardiogram, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory gas exchange and ventilation)” would be most suitable, in correspondence with the rate of perceived exertion.

====Treatment Options====

With no formal prescription medicine available for sufferers this only increases the importance of focussing upon the reduction in frequency and intensity of symptoms. Many sufferers utilise medications such as “tricyclic agents, antidepressants, anxiolytic agents, anti-inflammatory agents and antihistamines” to deal with their symptoms. Some take a holistic approach to healing and focus upon diet and nutritional changes, herbal options, massage and chiropractic therapy and aromatherapy. Yet coping mechanisms such as stress management plans should continue to be individualised, dependant upon severity and at the individuals discretion.

&lt;ref&gt;ACSM’s Exercise Management for Persons with Chronic Diseases and Disabilities&lt;/ref&gt;

==RECOMMENDATIONS==
* Attention should be placed upon how the individual perceives their symptoms upon a daily basis, this should be recorded. 
* Complete exercise at an incremental pace - despite feelings of frustration and worthlessness,  be patient!
* The individual should seek support, from family or friends or via online groups such as the ‘Toby Morrison - Health and Lifestyle’ Facebook page. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/tobymorrisoncfs?fref=ts&lt;/ref&gt;
* Focus upon increasing sleep, taking regular breaks to avoid crashing, nutrition, water intake, stress management and engaging in things that make the sufferer happy.

====What is Down Syndrome?====

Down Syndrome is a genetic condition, in the human body there are 23 pairs of chromosomes, which is 46 individual chomosomes in every cell. An individual with Down Syndrome has an extra chromosome 21, therefore has 47 chromosomes. there are many different physical and mental characteristics that identifies a individual with Down Syndrome. An individual with Down Syndrome is can be identified at birth and it is normally confirmed by a blood test. &lt;ref&gt; Down Syndrome Victoria Available from: http://www.downsyndromevictoria.org.au/DSAV/Information/About_Down_syndrome/What_is_Down_syndrome/DSAV/Information/What_is_Down_syndrome.aspx? &lt;/ref&gt;

====Signs of Down Syndrome====
Some signs of individuals with down syndrome are&lt;ref&gt; Pubic Medical Health Available from: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001992/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Decrease muscle tone at birth
* Excess skin on the nape of the neck
* Flattened nose
* Small ears
* Small mouth 
* Upward slanting eyes
* Wide short hands and fingers&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH000199 2]&lt;/sup&gt;

Physical development in individuals with down syndrome is slower than what it is in an average person. A lot of individuals with down syndrome never reach average adult height. Children with down syndrome may be affected by a delay of there mental and social development. Some problems included 
* Poor judgement 
* Slower Learning 
* impulsive behaviour 
* Short attention span&lt;sup&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH000199 2]&lt;/sup&gt;.

====Prevalence====

It is estimated that 1 in 800 babies are born with Down Syndrome. &lt;ref&gt; Down Syndrome Association of Queensland Inc Available from: http://www.dsaq.org.au/information-about-down-syndrome.htm &lt;/ref&gt; About 13,000 people in Australia have Down Syndrome and the numbers increasing by the day. &lt;ref&gt;Down Syndrome Australia Available from: http://www.downsyndrome.org.au/info.html &lt;/ref&gt;

==What is Resistance Training?==

Resistance training is also referred to as weight training or strength training, is to use resistance in the muscle contraction to build muscular strength in skeletal muscle.&lt;ref&gt; Better Health Channel Sited: http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Resistance_training_the_health_benefits &lt;/ref&gt;  weak muscles are common in individuals with down syndrome. &lt;sup&gt;[11]&lt;/sup&gt; The most common job for an individual with down syndrome is a job that require physical work.  &lt;ref&gt;Shields N, Taylor NF, Dodd KJ (2008) Effects of a community- based progressive resistance training program on muscle performance and physical function in adults with Down syndrome: a randomized controlled trial. Archives of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation 89: 1215–1220 &lt;/ref&gt; A decrease in physical strength can have a negative impact on the individual with down syndrome socially and economically. &lt;sup&gt;[ 6]&lt;/sup&gt; 
====Why is Resistance Training Important for individuals with Down Syndrome?====

Resistance training is important for individuals with down syndrome because they have around 50% less muscle strength than there peers with normal development.&lt;ref&gt;Croce RV, Pitetti KH, Horvat M, Miller J (1996) Peak torque, average power, and hamstrings/quadriceps ratios in non-disabled adults and adults with mental retardation. Archives of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation 77: 369–372 &lt;/ref&gt;in adolescence children with down syndrome become less active therefore it would be important for them to do strength training so they don't lose a more strength.&lt;ref&gt; Shields N, Dodd K, Abblitt C (2009) Children with Down syndrome do not perform sufficient physical activity to maintain good health or optimize cardiovascular fitness. Adapted Physical Activity Quarterly 26: 307–320. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Exercise Recommendations==
 
Some exercises that could be conducted to increase muscle strength are &lt;ref&gt;Shawn M. Arent, Michelle Karczewski and John C. Greenwood, improving Active Range of Motion of Athletes with Down Syndrome Through Strength Training&lt;/ref&gt;

Upper Body
* Bench Press 
* Seated Row
* Shoulder Press 
* Bicep Curls

Lower Body 
* Leg Press 
* Wall Squat
* Leg Extension 
*Leg Curls

some studies have done a 10 week training period which the participants turned up for 90% of the training session. A ten week program did have an advantage as it fit in with the school term and &lt;ref&gt;Nora Shields and Nicholas F Taylor, A student-led progressive resistance training program increases lower limb muscle strength in adolescents with Down syndrome: a randomised controlled trial, Shields and Taylor: Resistance exercise in Down syndrome&lt;/ref&gt;. studies have shown that doing a six- ten week training program, 2-3 times a week will help improve strength &lt;ref&gt;Sukriti Gupta, Bhamini krishna Rao and Kumaran SD, Effect of strength and balance training in children with Down’s syndrome: a randomized controlled trial, Clinical Rehabilitation 2011; 25: 425–432&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Breast Cancer Prevalence ==
Worldwide, breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer related death in women &lt;ref name=&quot;Key&quot;&gt;Key, T. J., Verkasalo, P. K., &amp; Banks, E. (2001). Epidemiology of Breast Cancer. 2(3).&lt;/ref&gt;. Prevalence is greater in more developed western countries; whereas the rates in less developed countries are low but increasing &lt;ref name=&quot;Key&quot;/&gt;.  In 2002, more than 4.4 million women were reportedly living with breast cancer, &lt;ref&gt;Veronesi, U., Boyle, P., Goldhirsch, A., Orecchia, R., &amp; Viale, G. (2005). Breast Cancer. 365(9472)&lt;/ref&gt;, while in 2008, estimates showed 1.38 million new cases of breast cancer were diagnosed, with 458,000 breast cancer related deaths &lt;ref name=&quot;Sainsbury&quot;&gt;Sainsbury, R. (2013). The Development of Endocrine Therapy for Women with Breast Cancer. 39(5).&lt;/ref&gt;. While breast cancer predominantly effects the female population, males are also susceptible, with 1500 new cases diagnosed annually in the United States alone &lt;ref&gt;Giordano, S. H., Buzdar, A. U., &amp; Hortobagyi, G. N. (2002). Breast Cancer in Men. 137(8).&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Risk Factors for Breast Cancer ==
While it is hard to decipher the exact cause of breast cancer, there are a number of risk factors associated with its development. It has been suggested that the incidence of breast cancer increases with age, with incidence rates roughly doubling every 10 years through until around the age of 50 when menopause occurs, following menopause, the rate increase substantially slows &lt;ref&gt;McPherson, K., Steel, C. M., &amp; Dixon, J. M. (2000). Breast Cancer - Epidemiology, Risk Factors and Genetics. 321(7270).&lt;/ref&gt;. Family history also plays a role in increasing the risk of breast cancer. Research suggests the risk was significantly greater for women with first-degree relatives with breast cancer.  This risk factor also increased with the number of first degree relatives whom had breast cancer &lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;&gt;Nelson, H. D., Zakher, B., Cantor, A., Fu, R., Griffin, J., O'Meara, E., &amp; et. al. (2012). Risk Factors for Breast Cancer for Women Aged 40 to 49 years. 156(9).&lt;/ref&gt;. Additional personal risk factors for breast cancer include race, ethnicity, BMI, physical activity, alcohol use and smoking &lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;/&gt;.

== Common Treatments and Interventions ==
Among the most common, successful treatments for breast cancer is radiation therapy and hormone control. The use of breast conserving treatment, which includes a partial mastectomy and radiation therapy on residual breast tissue, as an alternative for a full mastectomy for early-stage breast cancer has increased due largely to its cosmetic results &lt;ref&gt;Shimozuma, K., Ganz, P. A., Petersen, L., &amp; Hirji, K. (1999). Quality of Life in the First Year After Breast Cancer Surgery: Rehabilitation Needs and Patterns of Recovery. 56(1).&lt;/ref&gt;. Multiple high-quality randomized trials has demonstrated the use of radiation therapy to play a crucial role in supporting breast conservation, enhancing local-regional control and improving the chance of survival, with approximately 120,000 breast cancer patients treated with radiation annually &lt;ref&gt;Smith, B. D., Pan, I.-W., Shih, Y.-C. T., Smith, G. L., Farris, J. R., Punglia, R., &amp; et.al. (2011). Adoption of Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy for Breast Cancer in the United States. 103(10).&lt;/ref&gt;.

Aside from radiation therapy, the development and implementation of diverse selective endocrine therapies has led a shift from ablative surgery and chemotherapy to a more targeted, less aggressive form of breast cancer treatment. The endocrine therapies have reportedly been better tolerated and have improved both quality of life and mortality in patients suffering from hormone-responsive disease &lt;ref name=&quot;Sainsbury&quot;/&gt;. 

The use of diet and exercise interventions for breast cancer survivors helps to promote a healthy lifestyle. These interventions are commonly aimed at increasing levels of daily physical activity, increasing fruit and vegetable intake and optimizing healthy lifestyle practices. Diet and exercise interventions have proven to reduce co-morbidities in cancer survivors and can protect against the recurrence of cancer-specific mortality &lt;ref&gt;Denmark-Wahnefried, W., Clipp, E. C., Lipkus, I. M., Lobach, D., Clutter Snyder, D., Sloane, R., &amp; et.al. (2007). Main Outcomes of the FRESH START Trial: A Sequentially Tailored, Diet and Exercise Mailed Print Intervention Among Breast and Prostate Cancer Survivors. 26(19).&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Benefits of Exercise for Breast Cancer Recovery ==
Exercise interventions for breast cancer recovery should be used to help preserve or restore physical and psychological functions that are adversely affected by cancer related therapies &lt;ref&gt;Stevinson, C., Lawlor, D. A., &amp; Fox, R. K. (2004). Exercise Interventions for Cancer Patients: A Systematic Review of Controlled Trials. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;. Benefits from exercise based interventions for individuals recovering from breast cancer include improvements in cardiorespiratory fitness &lt;ref name=&quot;McNeely&quot;&gt;McNeely, M. L., Campbell , K. L., Rowe, B. H., Klassen, T. P., Mackey, J. R., &amp; Courneya, K. S. (2006). Effects of Exercise on Breast Cancer Patients and Survivors: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis. 175(1).&lt;/ref&gt; , greater peak oxygen consumption,&lt;ref name=&quot;Courneya&quot;&gt;Courneya, K. S., Mackey, J. R., Bell, G. J., Jones, L. W., Field, C. J., &amp; Fairey, A. S. (2003). Training in Postmenopausal Breast Cancer Survivors: Cardiopulmonary and Quality of Life Outcomes. 21(9).&lt;/ref&gt; , better physical functioning and a reduction in the symptoms of fatigue &lt;ref name=&quot;McNeely&quot;/&gt;. It is a combination of these characteristics that leads to an increase in quality of life &lt;ref name=&quot;McNeely&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Courneya&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Courneya, K. S. (2003). Exercise in Cancer Survivors: An Overview of Research. 35(11).&lt;/ref&gt;, which for people recovering from breast cancer should be an outcome held in high regard.

== Considerations for Exercise and Breast Cancer Recovery ==
Before commencing any exercise program, it is important for the prescribing practitioner or fitness professional to have an understanding of common therapeutic approaches to treating cancer &lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitz&quot;&gt;Schmitz, K. H., Courneya, K. S., Matthews, C., Denmark-wahnefried, W., Galvao, D. A., Pinto, B. M., &amp; et.al. (2010). American College of Sports Medicine Roundtable on Exercise Guyidelines for Cancer Survivors. Special Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;. As a whole, most cancer patients will undergo some form of surgery, whether it be major or minor. Furthermore, around 50% or cancer patients will undergo some form of radiation therapy throughout their treatment &lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitz&quot;/&gt;. In addition to the abovementioned treatments, breast cancer patients will often be exposed to hormone therapies, with the type and duration of the treatment assigned on an individual basis &lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitz&quot;/&gt;. To prescribe a safe and effective exercise intervention, the specifics of the cancer diagnosis and treatment must be acknowledged. Further insight into pre-diagnosis fitness levels may also help to distinguish body systems adversely affected by therapies used &lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitz&quot;/&gt;. Other changes from breast cancer therapies may also include, but are not limited to, second cancers, fatigue, pain, changes to the cardiorespiratory and endocrine systems, and musculoskeletal variations &lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitz&quot;/&gt;.

== Exercise Recommendations ==
Prior to the commencement of an exercise programming, adequate testing from a medical team should be conducted. For breast cancer patients, this should include an evaluation of peripheral neuropathies, musculoskeletal morbidities and assessment of the risk of fractures &lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitz&quot;/&gt;. Following satisfactory outcomes from medical evaluations, low to moderate intensity aerobic exercise, performed 3-5 times per week for at least 20 minutes per session, should be conducted with the aim to return the patient to regular daily activities &lt;ref name=&quot;Schmitz&quot;/&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;Hayes&quot;&gt;Hayes, S. C., Spence, R. R., Galvao, D. A., &amp; Newton, R. U. (2009). Australian Association for Exercise and Sport Science Position Stand: Optimising Cancer Outcomes Through Exercise. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;. Resistance exercise selection should be dynamic in nature and use both eccentric and concentric contractions &lt;ref name=&quot;Hayes&quot;/&gt;. Resistance training should be conducted 1-3 times per week and incorporate 6-10 exercises, with 1-4 sets per muscle group. Intensity for resistance training should be between 50-80% of 1 repetition maximum &lt;ref name=&quot;Hayes&quot;/&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==  Modules and packages ==

Julia code is organized into files, modules, and packages. Julia files use the .jl file extension. 

===Modules===

Related functions and other definitions can be stored in a '''module'''. The structure of a module is like this:

&lt;pre&gt;module

end
&lt;/pre&gt;

and you can put functions, type definitions, etc. inside. If you want users of the module to be able to use the functions without having to provide the module prefix each time, export them explicitly:

&lt;pre&gt;module MyModule
export mycoolfunction

function mycoolfunction()
   println(&quot;this is my cool function&quot;)
end

end
&lt;/pre&gt;

To use functions and definitions from a module, the '''using''' keyword accepts the names of one or more modules:

&lt;pre&gt;using MyModule
&lt;/pre&gt;

All functions in the MyModule package are available, and the ones that have been exported can be used with or without the module name as prefix:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt;using MyModule
julia&gt; MyModule.mycoolfunction()
&quot;this is my cool function&quot;
julia&gt; mycoolfunction()
&quot;this is my cool function&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== using and import====

&lt;tt&gt;import&lt;/tt&gt; is similar to &lt;tt&gt;using&lt;/tt&gt;, but differs in how you access the functions inside the module. Here's a module with two functions, one of which is exported:

&lt;pre&gt;module MyModule
export mycoolfunction

function mycoolfunction()
   println(&quot;this is my cool function&quot;)
end

function mysecretfunction()
   println(&quot;this is my secret function&quot;)
end

end
&lt;/pre&gt;

Import the module:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; import MyModule
julia&gt; mycoolfunction()
ERROR: mycoolfunction not defined

julia&gt; MyModule.mycoolfunction()
&quot;this is my cool function&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice that &lt;tt&gt;mycoolfunction()&lt;/tt&gt; could be accessed '''only''' with the module prefix. This is because the MyModule module was loaded using '''import''' rather than '''using'''. Similarly for &lt;tt&gt;mysecretfunction()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; mysecretfunction()
ERROR: mysecretfunction not defined

julia&gt; MyModule.mysecretfunction()
this is my secret function
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Include, require, reload====

If you want to use the code from other files that aren't contained in modules, there are the following functions:

&lt;tt&gt;include(pathname)&lt;/tt&gt; evaluates the contents of the file in the context of the current module. This is useful for building modules out of multiple files.

&lt;tt&gt;require(filename)&lt;/tt&gt; loads the file in the context of the Main module. It first looks in the current working directory, then looks for package code under the current package directory (as reported by &lt;tt&gt;Pkg.dir()&lt;/tt&gt;), then tries paths stored in the global array LOAD_PATH.

&lt;tt&gt;reload(filename)&lt;/tt&gt; reloads the file, and you would probably use this while developing your code.

=== How does Julia find a module?===

Julia looks for module files in directories defined in the LOAD_PATH variable. Julia looks for files in those directories in the form of a package with the structure

&lt;pre&gt;ModuleName/src/file.jl&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Packages===

To download and install a package from the official Julia repository on Github and add it to your Julia installation, you use the &lt;tt&gt;Pkg.add()&lt;/tt&gt; function, one of many functions in the Pkg module for managing the packages you've installed.

&lt;pre&gt;Pkg.add(packagename)
&lt;/pre&gt;

For example, suppose you want to do some calculus with Julia. You'll first have to download and install the Calculus package:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt;Pkg.add(&quot;Calculus&quot;)
INFO: Cloning cache of Calculus from git://github.com/johnmyleswhite/Calculus.jl.git
INFO: Installing Calculus v0.1.5
INFO: Package database updated
&lt;/pre&gt;

After a successful installation, you'll be able to use the module (or possibly modules) provided by the package in the usual way:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; using Calculus
julia&gt; Calculus.derivative(sin, 0.0)
0.9999999999938886
julia&gt; derivative(cos, 1.0)
-0.8414709847974693
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you type:
 
&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt;import Calculus
&lt;/pre&gt;

you will be able to use the functions exported by this module '''only''' if you use the Calculus prefix:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; derivative(sin, 0.0)
ERROR: derivative not defined
julia&gt; Calculus.derivative(sin, 0.0)
0.9999999999938886
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Structure of a package ====

This is how the Calculus package is organized:

&lt;pre&gt;Calculus.jl/                                       # this is the main package directory for the Calculus package
  src/                                             # this is the subdirectory containing the source
    Calculus.jl                                    # this is the main file - notice the capital letter
      module Calculus                              # inside this file, declare the module name
        import Base.ctranspose                     # and import other packages
        export derivative, check_gradient,         # export some of the functions defined in this package
        ...
        include(&quot;derivative.jl&quot;)                   # include the contents of other files in the module
        include(&quot;check_derivative.jl&quot;)             # 
        include(&quot;integrate.jl&quot;)
      end                                          # end of Calculus.jl file
    derivative.jl                                  # this file contains code for working with derivatives, and will be included by Calculus.jl 
      function derivative()
        ...
      end
        ...
    check_derivative.jl                            # this file concentrates on derivatives, and will be included by Calculus.jl
      function check_derivative(f::...)
        ...
      end
      ...
    integrate.jl                                   # this file concentrates on integration, and will be included by Calculus.jl
      function adaptive_simpsons_inner(f::Function......
        ...
      end
      ...
    symbolic.jl                                    # this file concentrates on symbolic matters, and will be included by Calculus.jl
      export processExpr, BasicVariable, ...       # these functions are available to users of the module
      import Base.show, ...                        # some functions are imported because they're needed here
      type BasicVariable &lt;: AbstractVariable
        ...
      end
      function process(x::Expr)
        ...
      end
      ...     
  test/                                            # this directory is for testing the Calculus module
    runtests.jl                                    # this file runs the tests
      using Calculus                               # obviously the tests use the Calculus module 
      using Base.test                              # and the Base.test module 
      tests = [&quot;finite_differerence&quot;, ...          # the test file names are stored as strings 
      for t in tests
        include(&quot;$(t).jl&quot;)                         # so that they can be evaluated in a loop 
      end
      ...
    finite_difference.jl                           # this file contains tests for finite differences, its name is included and run by runtests.jl
      @test ...
      ...&lt;/pre&gt;

==Global variables and scope==

It's common to want to control access to variables. Sometimes you want to define a variable so that every function in the module can use the same value. To do this, you can use the '''global''' keyword when defining the variable.

Here's an example of a module called Sundial, and how you can access the variable called &lt;tt&gt;latitude&lt;/tt&gt;, which presumably will be useful for a number of different functions inside the module.

&lt;pre&gt;module Sundial
global latitude = 52
export latitude, get_lat, set_lat, use_lat
function get_lat()
   println(&quot;in Sundial.get_lat, latitude is $latitude&quot;)
end

function set_lat(lat)
   global latitude
   latitude = lat
   println(&quot;in Sundial.set_lat, latitude is now $latitude&quot;)
end

function use_lat_fail()
   try
     println(&quot;in Sundial.use_lat_fail, latitude is $latitude&quot;)
   catch
     println(&quot;couldn't find it&quot;)
   end
   
   latitude = 0
   println(&quot;in Sundial.use_lat_fail, latitude was set to 0, is $latitude&quot;)
end

function use_lat()
   global latitude
   try
     println(&quot;in Sundial.use_lat, latitude is $latitude&quot;)
   catch
     println(&quot;couldn't find it&quot;)
   end
   
   latitude = 0
   println(&quot;in Sundial.use_lat, latitude was set to 0, is $latitude&quot;)
end
end&lt;/pre&gt;

The second line of the module uses the '''global''' keyword and sets the value of the variable to 52. Other functions in the module can access this variable if they use the '''global''' keyword. These functions, and the name of the variable, are exported using this line:

&lt;pre&gt;export latitude, get_lat, set_lat, use_lat
&lt;/pre&gt;

Before you load the module into Julia, there is no variable called &lt;tt&gt;latitude&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; latitude
ERROR: latitude not defined
&lt;/pre&gt;

After adding the module:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; using Sundial
&lt;/pre&gt;

the value of &lt;tt&gt;latitude&lt;/tt&gt; is available, and can be used without the prefix, because the module exported it and because we loaded the module with &lt;tt&gt;using&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; latitude
52
&lt;/pre&gt;

It's also available with its module prefix:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Sundial.latitude
52
&lt;/pre&gt;

but we can't change its value, because we're not &quot;in&quot; the Sundial module, as the error message tells us:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Sundial.latitude = 2
ERROR: cannot assign variables in other modules

Our &lt;tt&gt;get_lat()&lt;/tt&gt; function can access the variable's value:

julia&gt; Sundial.get_lat()
in Sundial.get_lat, latitude is 52
&lt;/pre&gt;

Although you can read the value easily, you can't set it. For example:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; latitude = 40
Warning: imported binding for latitude overwritten in module Main
40
&lt;/pre&gt;

The warning here tells you that there are now two variables called &lt;tt&gt; latitude&lt;/tt&gt;, a new one you've created in the &lt;tt&gt; Main&lt;/tt&gt; context, and the existing one in the &lt;tt&gt; Sundial&lt;/tt&gt; context. They have different values:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; latitude
40

julia&gt; Sundial.latitude
52

julia&gt; Main.latitude
40
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;get_lat()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;set_lat()&lt;/tt&gt; functions provided by the module allow you to access and change the values from anywhere:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Sundial.get_lat()
in Sundial.get_lat, latitude is 52

julia&gt; Sundial.set_lat(45)
in Sundial.set_lat, latitude is now 45

julia&gt; Sundial.get_lat()
in Sundial.get_lat, latitude is 45
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;set_lat()&lt;/tt&gt; function used the '''global''' keyword at the start of the definition. This means that code inside the function definition can change the value.

Without the '''global''' keyword, as in the &lt;tt&gt;use_lat_fail()&lt;/tt&gt; function, any attempt to change the module's latitude variable fails. 

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Sundial.use_lat_fail()
couldn't find it
in Sundial.use_lat_fail, latitude was set to 0, is 0
&lt;/pre&gt;

But wait: the &lt;tt&gt;use_lat_fail()&lt;/tt&gt; function '''appears''' to work - it says that latitude was set to 0. This is a new, local, latitude symbol created just for the duration of the &lt;tt&gt;user_lat_fail()&lt;/tt&gt; function. However, you can quickly check to reassure yourself that the &quot;real&quot; module's variable has not been set to 0:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Sundial.get_lat()
in Sundial.get_lat, latitude is 45
&lt;/pre&gt;

To change the variable, the &lt;tt&gt;use_lat()&lt;/tt&gt; (without the '&lt;tt&gt;_fail&lt;/tt&gt;') function can set the module's latitude variable to 0, thanks to the use of the '''global''' keyword:
  
&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Sundial.use_lat()
in Sundial.use_lat, latitude is 45
in Sundial.use_lat, latitude was set to 0, is 0
&lt;/pre&gt;

The warning you received above, about overriding the imported binding in Main, prepares you for the following:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; latitude
40

julia&gt; Sundial.latitude
0

julia&gt; Main.latitude
40

julia&gt; Sundial.get_lat()
in Sundial.get_lat, latitude is 0
&lt;/pre&gt;

The Main context's version of latitude, also available without the Main prefix, is still 40; the &lt;pre&gt;use_lat()&lt;/pre&gt; function changed the module's latitude variable to 0. You can't now access the module's version of &lt;tt&gt;latitude&lt;/tt&gt; without using the &lt;tt&gt;Sundial&lt;/tt&gt; prefix.

The correct way to set the value of the module's global variable is to use &lt;tt&gt;set_lat()&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;julia&gt; Sundial.set_lat(45)
in Sundial.set_lat, latitude is now 45

julia&gt; latitude
60

julia&gt; Sundial.latitude
45

julia&gt; Main.latitude
60

julia&gt; Sundial.get_lat()
in Sundial.get_lat, latitude is 45 
&lt;/pre&gt;

The 'wrong' ones are still 60, but the module's version is correctly set to 45.

1.1	&lt;u&gt;Light microscopy&lt;/u&gt; uses visible light and a system of lenses to observe tiny objects which are naked to the human eye through magnification. Specimens viewed with a light microscope can either be living or dead but are usually stained with a well colored dye to make them visible under the light microscope. A light microscope also uses several lenses to obtain high resolution through the application of the best magnification. Light microscopy however does not provide enough resolution to view the organelles of the cell, on the contrary it only has resolution which allows us to only view the cell in general. There are several vital steps and precautions which have to be practiced when using light microscopy. Slides used in light microscopy have to be prepared using a very specific procedure and it has the following steps:
•	Fixation which prevents distortion of the specimen
•	Dehydration to prevent deflection of the electrons which blurs the image
•	Embedding to support the tissue in wax
•	Staining in order to increase the contrast between structures
•	Mounting of slides to protect the specimen which provides suitable viewing

1.2	Bacterial cell walls are the only cell walls with the presence of a peptidoglycan. They withstand turgor pressure and maintains cell shape. In addition to that they also provide structural integrity to the cell and provides rigidity to the cell. Cell walls in bacteria could either be gram positive or gram negative. The gram positive bacterial cell walls are made up of 90% peptidoglycan layer and the gram negative only consists of a very minute fraction of the peptidoglycan. In the gram positive bacterial cell wall, the peptidoglycan is a very large polymer of interlocking chains of identical peptidoglycan monomers. Gram negative cell walls are thin and contains a very thin layer of peptidoglycan adjacent to the cell membrane.

1.3	Eukaryotic cell organelles – eukaryotic cells have membrane bound organelles which makes them very much advanced and complex cells. These cell organelles are more specialised units of the cell, enclosed in their own specific lipid bilayers, which allows them to perform various specific functions vital for the cell’s functioning and survival. The cells organelles in the eukaryotic cells are pretty much like to cells as the body organs such as the eye, heart etc. are to the body. They are of most importance. They are the building blocks of a eukaryotic cell and most of these organelles are not present in the prokaryotic cells. Some of the eukaryotic cell organelles are DNA containing and have originated from formerly autonomic microscopic organisms acquired through the process of endosymbiosis. On the contrary some of the eukaryotic cell organelles do not have their own DNA but still have endosymbiosis origins. Some of the well-known organelles of the eukaryotic cells are the mitochondria, chloroplasts Golgi apparatus, lysosomes etc. these organelles are partitioned which permits various kinds of biochemical reactions to occur in various organelles of the cell. They also perform uniquely specific functions but they also all work together in an integrated fashion to meet the eukaryotic cell’s needs. The nucleus is the well most important of the eukaryotic cell organelles because it localises the DNA and controls all the cell’s activities. 

1.4	Nutrient uptake by bacteria – there are several forms which bacteria uses for the uptake of vital body nutrients. These vary from consuming dead/decomposed matter to autotroph bacteria which produces its own food using the solar energy, to mention but a few. Bacteria that consume dead matter usually first decompose e.g. leaves, cadavers etc. by secreting digestive enzymes in their skin onto the food source. Cyanobacteria for instance can photosynthesis during their synthesis of oxygen which we use, purple nonsulfure bacteria obtains its energy and nutrients from organic compounds. In so doing these mentioned bacteria are able to produce their own food and obtain nutrients from organic compounds, respectively. Some bacteria are symbiotic, thus they form a mutualistic benefit with other organisms i.e. humans and aid us in assimilating the food we consume at the same time also obtaining their much desired nutrients from our bodies without causing harm. Some bacteria actually manufacture essential nutrients which we cannot make on our own and in return they also obtain the nutrients they require from our bodies.

1.5	Bacteria growth curve – This is a graphical curve that shows the changes in the size of a bacterial population over time in a culture. Bacterial growth is a process characterised by asexual reproduction through a process known as binary fission and this can be purely achieved from culture media growth. The bacteria are cultured in sterile nutrient medium and incubated at optimum temperature for growth. Samples are continuously removed at intervals and the populations of viable bacteria is counted. Bacteria are also characterised by high rates of metabolism and sensitivity to antibiotics. A logarithmic curve is constructed is constructed from the data representing the population over time. The bacterial growth curve has four essential phases which begins with:
•	The lag phase – bacteria are still adopting themselves to growth conditions. Individual bacteria still undergoes maturity and are not able to undergo cell division at this point in time. The cells are metabolically active and only their size not the populations increase. This period is intense since it involves a variety of physiological adjustments.
•	Exponential phase – have developed prone to their environment. Their mass and size begin to increase in an exponential manner. An increase in cell size and an increase in metabolic rates start to occur. It is also characterised by the rapid growth and the division of colony cells through binary fission at a constant rate that is directly proportional to a much quicker growth rate. Cell doubling also occurs. The number of bacteria appearing per unit time is directly proportional to the present population and when growth issue is limited doubling continues at a constant rate.
•	Stationary phase – this is also known as the growth limiting phase and one major factor that causes it is limited resources i.e. nutritional exhaustion etc. This is also a result of the growth rate being equal or in equilibrium with the dearth rate. The complete consumption of nutrients results in accumulation of waste material, toxic metabolites and inhibitory compounds i.e. antibiotics developing in the medium. Uncontrolled conditions such as pH, temperature etc. are also unfavourable for bacterial growth and lead to the bacterial populations decreasing. 
•	Death phase – dearth of bacteria occurs due to a complete depletion of nutrients, unfavourable conditions developing, autolysis of enzymes and accumulation of waste and consumption toxic material in the medium. Death is rapid at a very uniform rate as the populations of dead cells becomes more than the numbers of living cells.

1.6	Pasteurisation – this is a process invented by a French chemist, Luis Pasteur between 1822 and 1895. It involves the purification of foods at an optimum temperature that destroys undesirable, harmful (conditions) microbes without killing them and without a major alteration on the actual food’s chemistry. It also limits the rate of fermentation which also permits the growth of bacteria. It is a process widely used in treating beer, wine, fruit juices, cheese, eggs etc. unlike the actual sterilisation process, pasteurisation is not intended in killing the microbes in the food but instead it aims to reduce the number of viable pathogens so they won’t cause any infections. Pasteurisation effectively slows down the spoilage caused by microbial growth and make the food safely consumable for humans.

1.7	Pure culture – is culture obtained from one species of a microorganism. Pure culture can be effectively isolated from a single cell of a population with the aid of a micromanipulator or a very thing capillary. A pure culture can also be successfully obtained from mixed culture by carefully transferring a small sample into a new sterile growth medium in a manner that disperses the individual cells across the medium’s surface. It can also be obtained by thinning the sample manifold before inoculating the new medium. When the cells multiply, each will be a clearly distinct colony which can possibly be used to inoculate more medium. Isolation of pure culture may also be achieved by providing a mixed inoculum with a medium favouring the growth conditions of only one organism to the exclusion of the others. The isolation of pure culture is very vital in the classification and study of the variability of microorganisms, in the preparation of enzymes, antibiotics, vitamins, steroid hormones and in the production of vaccines.

1.8	Photoautotrophs – these are organisms (bacteria) with the ability to synthesis their own food using inorganic substances, use CO2 as their main carbon source and light as an energy source. Photoautotrophs also feed themselves by consuming food molecules from their close surroundings. Energy obtained from sunlight, water and CO2 is converted into inorganic material which is to be consumed in the food making process. Some of the inorganic material is also converted into organic material for use in cellular functions i.e. biosynthesis and respiration processes. Most photoautotrophs have the absence of a pigment which allows them to trap sunlight and convert the light energy into chemical energy. Since these organisms photosynthesis, they also provide nutrients for most life forms except for chemotrophs and autotrophs.

Question 2
 

Pilus/ pili
Hair like structure on the surface of the prokaryotes cells which attaches to other bacterial cells. It performs the transfer of DNA from cell to cell, facilitates in cell motility, and adhering to solid surfaces. 

Plasmalemma /cell membrane
The cell membrane is constructed from lipids such as fats and proteins, some of which are also involved in the transport of substances in and out of the cell. It provides protection, holds the prokaryotic cell and its contents in the rightful positions, protects the cell from its surroundings, and provides a selective permeability which allows the transfer of various substances in and out of the cell. It also plays a role in ion conductivity. Its permeability is affected by polarity, charge and size of the particles involved. 

Cell wall
The cell wall is a strong, soluble and rigid semi - permeable protective layer of polysaccharides outside the Plasmalemma/ cell membrane. It provides the cell with tensile strength, rigidity and maintains its structure. Its semi – permeability also filters substances in and out of the cell.it also protects the cell from mechanical stress and infections from the cell’s surroundings. In addition to that it provides the cell with limited plasticity which prevents the cell from rupturing due to turgor pressure. Its composition differs from species to species and in prokaryotes it is made up of peptidoglycans. 

Capsule
It is a very large polysaccharide structure that is positioned outside the cell envelop/ the cell membrane of a prokaryotic cell wall. The type of capsule found in prokaryote bacteria is glycocalyx which is a thin layer of tangled polysaccharide fibres which occurs on most surfaces of cells growing in nature. It is a well-designed layer, not easily washed off and it can also be the cause of various diseases. In bacteria capsule can be found in both gram positive and gram negative. The capsule protects bacteria (prokaryotes) cells from engulfment from attack by antimicrobial agents. In certain soil bacteria they protect cells from perennial effects of drying. Capsule material could also be overproduced from sugars in bacteria, later transformed and stored as reserve of carbohydrates for metabolism process. 

Cytoplasm
The cytoplasm is a clear liquid found in between the cell membrane and the nucleus of a cell. It is a gel – like structure composed mainly of water and contains enzymes, salts, organelles and many other molecules. It allows the movement of organelles and materials around the cell through cytoplasmic streaming. It is also referred to as cytosol, which means substance of the cell. It serves as a molecular soup as all the organelles are suspended in the cytoplasm. It also helps to dissolve waste products.

Ribosomes 
Are tiny substances consisting of RNA and are associated proteins found in large numbers free in the cytoplasm of (prokaryotes) cells. Ribosomes make up about 30% of the prokaryotic cell mass and are synthesised in the cytoplasm of the prokaryotic cells and aren’t entirely organelles. They are composed of the smaller subunit, which functions in the association with mRNA during translation and decoding, the bigger subunit which functions as a peptyl transferase centre as well as the sight of peptide bond formation. These subunits join catalyse the translation of mRNA into polypeptides chain during protein synthesis. Ribosomes are involved in the synthesis of peptides proteins and polypeptides. They also translate genetic material from mRNA into proteins during DNA translation. 

Nucleoid region 
The nucleoid region is not a true nucleus but it’s very much nuclear - like. It is only found in the prokaryotic cells and it is identified by its irregular circle - like shape and it lacks the presence of a nuclear sac or a nuclear membrane around it. The nucleus localises the genetic information (DNA) of the prokaryotic cell. This DNA is not housed by a nuclear membrane due to its absence. DNA found in the nucleoid region is circular and its copies could multiply at any given instant. The nucleoid region has all the genome of a prokaryotic cell since it houses all the necessary genes vital for growth of an organism and its survival. Since prokaryotic ribosomes aren’t separated from the nucleoid region, they bind to the mRNA being produced and begin making proteins. In turn this phenomenon makes the nucleoid region a site for protein synthesis as well.

Mesosme 
These are unusual structures produced by the chemical fixation techniques used to prepare electron microscope sample. They are only common to prokaryotic bacterial cells and usually identified as convulted invagination. Mesosomes function in the excretion of exoenzymes, binary fission and during the DNA replication of prokaryotic cells. These also function as sites for of localization of respiratory enzymes in addition to their involvement to secretion of glycocalyx as well as their ability to increase the surface area of the cell membrane. 

Flagella 
It is a very tiny thread – like structure made up of protein and a molecule: flagellin. Cells (prokaryotic cells) can have one or more flagella. Their basic is to assist in locomotion of the cell which is a process achieved by the flagellum’s continuous rotation. Flagella also has a neuroma function as it is also allows signal transduction and sensation through their rotation and movement.

Question 3.1

Microbial growth in a closed system - Batch is a closed system characterised by four distinct phases i.e. lag, exponential, stationary and death phase.   In a closed system, all material are added to the system at the beginning of the process and no additional nutrients are added. Since the system is closed, waste material are not removed until the end of the process. Products are only removed when the process is finished and the results shows the distinct characteristics of a growth curve.

Microbial growth in an open system is characterised by the addition of nutrients continuously during the process. Wastes can also be removed continuously even during the process to try and maintain continuous growth. Products can also leave the process at any time during or even after the process. An open cultivated system also maintains a steady state condition, in which the rate of increase of cell biomass with time is equal to zero, the total number of cells are constant and the total volume in the bioreactor are constant.


Environmental – nutrients: nutrients in the growth medium should provide all the vital elements necessary for the successful growth of bacteria and the synthesis of new organisms. Carbon, Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Sulphur, Phosphorous Mineral sources and Trace elements must be provided by the medium.  
Growth – organic compounds needs to be available in order for the bacterial cells to successfully grow. Bacterial cells cannot break organic substance therefore they need to be supplied in the form of nutrients in order for the cells to successfully consume the organic matter.
Metabolites – these are significant for the frequent and effective growth of bacterial cells and in order for them to be easily produced by the bacterial cells, they need to be provided in the medium
The medium pH – the right amount of pH for optimum growth needs to be obtained in the medium for the effective growth of bacterial cells.
Temperature – optimum temperature which is favourable for the growth of most types of bacterial cells
Light/darkness – optimum amount of light to darkness depending on whether the bacterium favours light or darkness for growth despite most bacteria being favourable to darkness.
Source of metabolic energy – either fermentation, respiration or photosynthesis has to be used by the various forms of bacteria in order to generate metabolic energy.</text>

== Background ==
'''Post Menopausal Osteoporosis''' is a progressive [[bone]] degenerative [[disease]] that causes the bone to decrease in mass and density. The degeneration of bone can be accelerated due to a lack of [[oestrogen]], a hormone that inhibits bone resorption and increases bone formation. As oestrogen decreases upon onset of [[menopause]], women above the age of 50 are at a high risk of developing post menopausal osteoporosis. The degrading effects of osteoporosis as well as the risk of developing osteoporosis can be minimised through the implementation of a [[resistance training]] regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldman&quot;&gt;Feldman, R. (2011). Development across the lifespan (pp. 483, 543) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;&gt;Johnson, K. (2012). Osteoporosis and menopause. Retrieved from http://www.webmd.com/menopause/osteoporosis-menopause &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marieb&quot;&gt;Marieb, E. N., &amp; Hoehn, K. (2013). Human anatomy &amp; physiology (pp. 186-194) &lt;/ref&gt;
=== Osteoporosis ===
'''Osteoporosis''' degenerates the bone into a porous, weak structure capable of fracturing easily. Osteoporosis commonly affects the elderly population, especially women. Approximately 25-30% of women between the ages of 60-70 years old have osteoporosis. As age increases, the incidence rate of osteoporosis also increases – approximately 70% of women have osteoporosis by the age of 80.&lt;ref name=&quot;Feldman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marieb&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Powers&quot;&gt;Powers, S., &amp; Howley, E. (2012). Exercise physiology: Theory and application to fitness and performance (8th ed., pp. 384-386) &lt;/ref&gt;
===== Signs and Symptoms =====
Osteoporosis is known as the “silent disease” due to its lack of outward symptoms. Most people affected by this disease are unaware they have developed it until their bones become so brittle that they fracture from a sudden movement or bump. The [[cancellous bone]] is the structure that is most affect by osteoporosis. The degradation of the cancellous bone causes the [[vertebrae]], and the neck of the [[femur]] to be at the most risk of fracturing. Osteoporosis can be diagnosed through a [[DXA Scanner]]. This scanner assesses the bone density the hip and vertebrae.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hailes&quot;&gt;Hailes, J. (2014). Osteoporosis. Retrieved from http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Osteoporosis &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marieb&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robb&quot;&gt;Robb-Nicholson, C. (January 2008). Eight for 2008: Eight things you should know about osteoporosis and fracture risk.15(5), 30th September 2014. &lt;/ref&gt;
===== Risk Factors =====
* Age
* Gender
* Diet
* Smoking Status
* Ethnicity
* Insufficient Exercise
* Hormone Related Conditions&lt;ref name=&quot;Hailes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marieb&quot;/&gt;

=== Menopause ===
'''Menopause''' is the natural and permanent cessation of the woman’s ability to reproduce which occurs at approximately 40 to 50 years old. For the majority of women, their periods become irregular for roughly 2 years. Once their period has been absent for a year, menopause has occurred and the woman is now said to be “post menopausal”. Once menopause has taken place, the woman is incapable of becoming pregnant in the traditional way- although [[IVF]] is still possible. In addition to the cessation of the period, oestrogen and [[progesterone]] levels begin to drop. &lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HailesMeno&quot;&gt;Hailes, J. (2014). Menopause. Retrieved from http://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/bhcv2/bhcarticles.nsf/pages/Menopause &lt;/ref&gt;
===== Signs and Symptoms =====
* Hot Flashes
* Night Sweats
* Migraines
* Rapid Heart Rate
* Dysfunctional Vaginal Bleeding
* Frequent Urination
* Muscle and Joint Pain
* Mood Disturbances
* Decreased Libido&lt;ref name=&quot;HailesMeno&quot;/&gt;

== Mechanism of Post Menopausal Osteoporosis ==
[[File:615 Age and Bone Mass.jpg|thumb|right|Bone loss due to hormone level changes as a consequence of menopause.]]
[[Bone remodelling]] is a necessary life long process where previous bone tissue is removed through [[bone resorption]] and then subsequently replaced in a process called [[ossification]].  The frequency of this process is determined by the functional stresses and demands placed on the body. The hormone [[oestrogen]] inhibits bone resorption and promotes ossification. As [[menopause]] develops, the production of oestrogen slows. As the oestrogen level is lowered, the inhibition of bone resorption is not as effective. This leads to the acceleration of bone degradation as well as the deceleration of bone ossification. The erosion of the bone produces a high risk of developing post menopausal osteoporosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hailes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marieb&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robb&quot;/&gt;

== Resistance Exercise ==
Stress must be placed on the bone structure to induce bone ossification. This stress will aid in the prevention of bone degradation whilst also slowing down the process of post menopausal osteoporosis. The most beneficial exercises to induce stress are resistance exercises.&lt;ref name=&quot;Powers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robb&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
''' Resistance Exercises''' are exercises that bear weight on the person’s body which in turn forces muscular contractions which places stress on the bones. A consistent resistance exercise regime produces overall health benefits including increased muscle mass and strength, tendon and ligament strength as well as improved bone density. &lt;ref name=&quot;Powers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Robb&quot;/&gt;
=== Recommendations ===
'''Frequency''' – 3-5 times per week&lt;br /&gt;
'''Intensity''' – Moderate to high (Must be performed at a comfortable level)&lt;br /&gt;
'''Time''' – 30-60 minutes per session&lt;ref name=&quot;Powers&quot;/&gt;
===== Example Resistance Exercises =====
A mixture of different types of resistance and weight bearing exercises may be important for overall health and the prevention of post menopausal osteoporosis. Some example resistance and weight bearing exercises include:
* Jogging
* Stair Climbing
* Hill Walking
* Dancing
* Yoga&lt;ref name=&quot;Baechle&quot;&gt;Baechle, T., &amp; Earle, R. (2008). Essentials of strength training and conditioning (pp. 332) &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hailes&quot;/&gt;
It may also be beneficial to include a range of gym equipment exercises that will aid in increasing muscular strength and endurance as well as providing a safe environment to exercise in. Please note that these exercises are best executed with a qualified health professional present to minimise risk of injury.  Some exercises include:
* Leg Press
* Leg Curls 
* Assisted Squats
* Bench Press
* Bicep Curls 
* Shoulder Press&lt;ref name=&quot;Baechle&quot;/&gt;

:This template forms correct addressing for a plain link construction {{wp|hyperlinking}} a Wikibook word or phrase to the {{N3V||TrainzOnline wiki}} (operated by {{Wp|N3V Games Pty., Ltd}}) covering the technical topic, but only for KIND topics. It has not been implemented for standard containers.

* It should be used in lieu of [[Template:TR]] when a Wikibook Trainz\reference\&lt;nowiki&gt;KIND {{{2}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; page is not currently present on the Wikibook, and the desire or need is to link to the technical reference page. Note, that some syntaxes involving caps and quotes may need the third parameter, and page names with quotes should be stripped of same, if a N3V wiki redirect page exists, or the Unicode %22 be substituted with the proper case in the second parameter.
* The first parameter should be specified as if linking to a augmented KIND article page here, hence the trimming of the quotes and elimination of capitals in the page title, {{BL|as we want names conformal to the actual names in config.txt files}}. (i.e. lower case, no quotes!)
&lt;br&gt;
;usage
This template forms a link between the [[Trainz|Trainz Wikibook]] and a ''''TrainzOnline'''' reference page on the {{wp|N3V Games}} Mediawiki based 'TrainzOnline Wiki' web site using: &lt;code&gt;http://online.ts2009.com/mediaWiki/index.php/&lt;/code&gt; as a prefix for the default url or equivalent&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; parameter.

* This template is used extensively in the [[Trainz]] Wikibook.

;notes
Adapted by merging logic in {{Tl|TBS}} to install underscores and {{tl|N3V}} url formation, use the later for complicated links containing escape codes (i.e. pages with Quote marks in titles.)'''
&lt;br&gt;
{{LeftBox|1=Accessing links with '''certain punctuation characters''' will break the link parsing. If a formed url truncates when testing the link, the next character needs a {{wp|Unicode|UNICODE}} escape character. }}

* The Prime case in linking N3V's TrainzOnline Wiki is pages containing the double-quote in the title such as &lt;code&gt;' &quot;Trainz-build&quot; tag '&lt;/code&gt; which can be coded as &lt;code&gt;'%22'&lt;/code&gt; for the quotes so using '&lt;code&gt; %22Trainz-build%22 tag &lt;/code&gt;' will work well. For these cases, it is best to use {{kp|CTRL-A|CTRL-C}} to capture the Unicoded pathspec and paste it ({{kp|CTRL-V}}) into the {{tl|N3V}} template directly.

&amp;nbsp;
{{TRS-warning|1= All links formed using this template should be verified by '''actually clicking on and navigating the link''' ''to validate it'' before closing the edit!&lt;br&gt;{{bullR}} This contra-indicates editing in Internet Explorer which won't like resuming the unchanged edit window!}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Background Information ==

Ischemic Heart Disease, more commonly known as ''Coronary Artery Disease'' or ''Coronary Heart Disease'', is the current leading cause of death for men and women within the United States&lt;ref name = &quot;simon&quot;&gt; Simon, H. (2012) 'Coronary Artery Disease' University of Maryland Medical Centre, retrieved from: http://umm.edu/health/medical/reports/articles/coronary-artery-disease&lt;/ref&gt;. The disease is the result of a build up of fatty plaque, made of cholesterol, which accumulates and solidifies to cause narrowing of the artery walls. This process is known as '''atherosclerosis'''. Atherosclerosis is damaging to the body as it can prevent sufficient blood supply from reaching the heart and other tissues, which reduces the amount of oxygen that these vital organs will receive. A lack of blood flow to the heart and muscles is termed '''ischemia'''&lt;ref&gt;American Heart Association (2014), 'Coronary Artery Disease - Coronary Heart Disease', retrieved from: http://www.heart.org/HEARTORG/Conditions/More/MyHeartandStrokeNews/Coronary-Artery-Disease---Coronary-Heart-Disease_UCM_436416_Article.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Risk Factors  ==

The most common factors associated with Ischemic heart disease include:&lt;ref name = &quot;simon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;south&quot;&gt;Southern Cross Healthcare Group, (2013), 'Coronary Heart Disease - causes, symptoms, prevention', retreived from: https://www.southerncross.co.nz/AboutTheGroup/HealthResources/MedicalLibrary/tabid/178/vw/1/ItemID/191/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;mayo&quot;/&gt;
* Smoking
* Diabetes
* High blood pressure
* Genetics (family history of heart disease)
* Obesity
* Age
* High levels of stress
* High levels of '''Low Density''' Lipoprotein cholesterol
* Low levels of '''High Density''' Lipoprotein cholesterol

These risk factors are found commonly among people with Ischemic heart disease, however, there have been reported cases of the disease without any of the standard risk factors.&lt;ref name = &quot;khot&quot;&gt; Khot, et al. (2003), Prevalence of Conventional Risk Factors in Patients with Coronary Heart Disease, retrieved from: http://pmmp.cnki.net/Resources/CDDPdf/evd%5C200801%5CJAMA%5C%E9%9A%8F%E6%9C%BA%E5%AF%B9%E7%85%A7%E8%AF%95%E9%AA%8C%5Cjama200329008898.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symptoms ==
=== Angina ===
Angina is the main symptom of Ischemic heart disease. It is regarded as a pressure or tightening in the chest which can cause acute or chronic pain, and is often triggered by stress.&lt;ref name = &quot;simon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;mayo&quot;&gt; Mayo Clinic (2014), 'Coronary Artery Disease', retrieved from: http://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/coronary-artery-disease/basics/symptoms/con-20032038&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Shortness of Breath ===
Since your heart cannot pump the required amount of blood around the body, you may develop a shortness of breath and even fatigue when exertion is required.

=== Myocardial Infarction ===
An artery that has been completely blocked with fatty plaque is extremely likely to cause a myocardial infarction, also known as a heart attack.&lt;ref name = &quot;mayo&quot;/&gt; The signs of a heart attack are generally seen through the former two symptoms, (Angina and a shortness of breath). However, a myocardial infarction can occur without any symptoms, and can be the first symptom of Ischemic Heart Disease.&lt;ref name = &quot;mayo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;khot&quot;/&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Some of the most common diagnosing tests include:

=== Electrocardiogram (ECG) ===
ECGs record the electrical activity of the heart, and can reveal changes within the heart beat that can display whether the heart is receiving enough oxygen. This can reveal a previous heart disorder, or any future heart problems that may be developing. However, in some cases the disease may not be recognised through an ECG reading.&lt;ref name = &quot;simon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;south&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;mayo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;green&quot;&gt;Greenland, et al. (2010) '2010 ACCF/AHA Guideline for Assessment of Cardiovascular Risk in Asymptomatic Adults'. Journal of the American College of Cardiology 56 (25): e50–103. doi:10.1016/j.jacc.2010.09.001&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exercise Stress Test ===
This is when the doctor will record heart beat readings (generally through ECG) whilst the patient is exercising. This is to examine the efficiency of the heart while under stress, to determine whether the heart is pumping enough blood and oxygen around the body.&lt;ref name = &quot;south&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;mayo&quot;/&gt;

=== Echocardiograph ===
This test uses ultrasound readings to investigate the heart. Echocardiographs use sound waves, and can be useful in displaying any areas that may be damaged or diseased. This test is useful for isolating the areas of disease, as doctors will be able to hear which valves of the heart are weakened, or which parts of the heart are pumping the least blood. The downside to this examination is that it is very expensive. &lt;ref name = &quot;simon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;south&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;mayo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;green&quot;/&gt;

== Treatment ==
Generally, the best treatment for any type of Heart Disease is lifestyle changes. This can include: Increasing exercise, quitting smoking, improving diet, etc.

=== Exercise ===
Increasing the regularity of exercise can reduce the symptoms of Ischemic heart disease quite dramatically. It is the effect of exercise on vital organs, cardiovascular tissues and levels of low-density cholesterol circulating in the blood that have the most effect. Since atherosclerosis occurs slowly over time, exercise needs to be maintained for a long period of time in order to reduce the level of atherosclerosis within the valves.&lt;ref name = &quot;taylor&quot;&gt;Taylor, et al. (2004) 'Exercise-Based Rehabilitation for Patients with Coronary Heart Disease: Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials' doi:10.1016/j.amjmed.2004.01.009&lt;/ref&gt; Due to increased blood and oxygen demand, the arteries will need to work harder and that blood being passed through these valves will gradually increase the size and efficiency of these arteries.
Exercise allows beneficial changes to cholesterol in the blood, it does this by decreasing low density lipoprotein levels and increasing high density lipoprotein levels.&lt;ref name = &quot;simon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;taylor&quot;/&gt;

== Background ==

=== Prevalence ===
In Australia the prevalence of Bipolar is about 1.3 percent of the population &lt;ref&gt;Abs.gov.au,. (2014). 4326.0 - National Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing: Summary of Results, 2007. Retrieved 24 September 2014, from http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/mf/4326.0&lt;/ref&gt; and has a bigger prevalence in the US with the figure being between 3 to 10 percent &lt;ref&gt;Sane.org,. (2014). Bipolar Disorder. Retrieved 24 September 2014, from http://www.sane.org/information/factsheets-podcasts/199-bipolar-disorder&lt;/ref&gt;.  

=== What is Bipolar Disorder? ===
Bipolar is a medical condition that effects the normal functioning of the brain, a person with Bipolar will experience extreme moods of highs and lows. Depending on how affected the person is they may not be able to distinguish what is real
&lt;ref&gt;Nimh.nih.gov,. (2014). NIMH · Bipolar Disorder in Adults. Retrieved 24 September 2014, from http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/bipolar-disorder-in-adults/index.shtml#pub11&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Symptoms &lt;ref&gt;Nimh.nih.gov,. (2014). NIMH · Bipolar Disorder in Adults. Retrieved 24 September 2014, from http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/bipolar-disorder-in-adults/index.shtml#pub11&lt;/ref&gt; ===
Bipolar can appear in many ways in different people, with the symptoms varying in their severity and frequency. There are 4 types of mood episodes in Bipolar disorder each with a different set of symptoms;
* Mania - unable to concentrate, high levels of energy with little sleep, delusions and hallucinations.  
* Hypomania - less severe than mania with people in this state never losing losing touch with reality, feelings associated with Hypomania include; energetic, euphoric and productive 
* Depression -sleep problems, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of hopelessness, sadness and emptiness
* Mixed Episodes - a mixed episode will have symptoms from both a manic and depressed state. 

=== Diagnosis &lt;ref&gt;Nimh.nih.gov,. (2014). NIMH · Bipolar Disorder in Adults. Retrieved 24 September 2014, from http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/bipolar-disorder-in-adults/index.shtml#pub11&lt;/ref&gt; ===
A doctor will diagnose a person with Bipolar into 1 of 4 categories;
* Bipolar 1 Disorder - manic or mixed episodes lasting 7 days
* Bipolar 2 Disorder - depressive and hypomanic episodes, but no manic or mixed episodes
* Bipolar Disorder not otherwise specified - diagnosed when symptoms of the illness exist but do not meet diagnostic criteria for either bipolar I or II. 
* Cyclothymic Disorder - mild form of bipolar, episodes of hypomania and mild depression for at least 2 years. 

===Triggers and Causes ===
Scientists believe there is not one cause for Bipolar disorder but a combination of factors that produce the illness or increase the risk of developing it.&lt;ref&gt;Nimh.nih.gov,. (2014). NIMH · Bipolar Disorder in Adults. Retrieved 24 September 2014, from http://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/publications/bipolar-disorder-in-adults/index.shtml#pub11&lt;/ref&gt;
These factors are believed to contribute to the risk of developing Bipolar.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, S. J., &amp; Browne, J. L. (2005). Staying well with bipolar disorder. Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 39(3), 187-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Medications including mood stabilisers 
* Psychotherapy to improve areas such as self esteem and develop coping techniques. 
* Change in Lifestyle eg quit smoking, improve diet and sleep patterns. 

== Exercise Effects on People with Bipolar Disorder ==
Exercise based interventions may benefit both physical and mental health among people with Bipolar disorder.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, K., Armstrong, T., Taylor, A., &amp; Dean, S. (2012). ‘It's a double edged sword’: A qualitative analysis of the experiences of exercise amongst people with Bipolar Disorder. Journal Of Affective Disorders, 136(3), 634--642.&lt;/ref&gt; Some theories are based upon that there is a mood-specific relationship between exercise frequency and polarity, where less exercise is associated with depression and more exercise associated with mania.&lt;ref&gt;JL deJONGSTE, M., NAGELKERKE, D., HOOYSCHUUR, C., JOURNEE, H., &amp; PIM WJ MEYLER, M. (2007). nutrition and exercise behavior. among patients with bipolar disorder†. Bipolar Disorders.&lt;/ref&gt; These studies often suggest interventions where exercise is increased or decreased depending on mood characteristics. 

One study illustrated that exercise can be a doubled edged sword for people with bipolar as it has the effect of increasing symptoms of mania, the intensity and frequency of the exercise seems to play a role in exacerbating symptoms. This same study also suggested that positive effects of exercise were diminished when a person experiences severe mania or depression.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, K., Armstrong, T., Taylor, A., &amp; Dean, S. (2012). ‘It's a double edged sword’: A qualitative analysis of the experiences of exercise amongst people with Bipolar Disorder. Journal Of Affective Disorders, 136(3), 634--642.&lt;/ref&gt;

When comparing people with Bipolar disorder to people with no serious medical illness people with Bipolar were shown to&lt;ref&gt;JL deJONGSTE, M., NAGELKERKE, D., HOOYSCHUUR, C., JOURNEE, H., &amp; PIM WJ MEYLER, M. (2007). nutrition and exercise behavior. among patients with bipolar disorder†. Bipolar Disorders.&lt;/ref&gt;;
* Exercise less (walking less then three times per week)
* Bipolar patients were more likely to report a weight gain of more than 10 pounds within the last 6 months and 
* Less likely report that their health care provider discussed there exercise habits.

|-
| Aerobic || Accumulate 150 to 300 minutes (2 ½ to 5 hours) of moderate intensity physical activity or 75 to 150 minutes (1 ¼ to 2 ½ hours) of vigorous intensity physical activity.
|-
| Resistance || Do muscle strengthening activities on at least 2 days each week.

Before beginning exercise patients must be prescreened, assessing a range of factors including current medication and associated comorbidities.  
Patients with manic and hypomanic symptoms must also seek medical advice on exercise program to make sure intensity and frequency of exercise is not a contributing factor to the illness.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==
Thrombosis is the formation of a clot in the blood that either blocks, or partially blocks a blood vessel. The thrombus may lead to infarction, or death of tissue, due to a reduced blood supply. When a blood vessel is damaged, the body prevents blood loss by using platelets and fibrin to form a clot.  A clot that detaches itself from the site and travels throughout the circulatory system is known as an embolus&lt;ref&gt;Furie B, Furie BC (2008). &quot;Mechanisms of thrombus formation&quot;. New England Journal of Medicine 359 (9): 938–949. doi:10.1056/NEJMra0801082. PMID 18753650.&lt;/ref&gt;. Thrombosis can occur in arteries (arterial thrombosis) and veins (venous thrombosis).
===Prevalence===
Thrombosis effects about 1 in 1000 individuals worldwide&lt;ref&gt;Cushman M. Epidemiology and risk factors for venous thrombosis. 2007;44(2):62--69.&lt;/ref&gt;. This rate rises rapidly in individuals over 45 years of age and appears to slightly effect men more than women&lt;ref&gt;Cushman M. Epidemiology and risk factors for venous thrombosis. 2007;44(2):62--69.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Causes==
Thrombosis is thought to be induced by one or a combination of the below factors, known as Virchow’s Triad&lt;ref&gt;April Wang Armstrong; David E. Golan; Armen H. Tashjian; Ehrin Armstrong (2008). Principles of pharmacology: the pathophysiologic basis of drug therapy. Philadelphia: Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins. p. 396. ISBN 0-7817-8355-0.&lt;/ref&gt;:

Endothelial dysfunction: cause of the insulin resistance syndrome. Diabetes. 1997;46(Supplement 2):9--13.&lt;/ref&gt;.
|-
| Hypercoagulability || An increase in the coagulability of the blood may be the cause of a genetic deficiency, an autoimmune disease and some forms of cancer treatment (radiation, chemotherapy)&lt;ref&gt;Chung I, Lip GY (2003). &quot;Virchow's triad revisited: blood constituents&quot;.

==Complications==
Complications of thrombosis are often ischemic-related that lead to a significant reduction or complete restriction of blood flow resulting in damage or potential death to a particular tissue. The most common complications are pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, stroke and cor pulmonale.

==Exercise==
	
It is well documented that individuals engaging in regular physical activity are less likely to experience a cardiovascular event&lt;ref&gt;Myers J. Exercise and cardiovascular health. Circulation. 2003;107(1):2--5.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Changes in lipid profile, insulin sensitivity and other physiological mechanisms in conjunction with lifestyle habits are thought to reduce this likelihood. There are a number of mechanisms of how exercise alone can reduced the likelihood of suffering a cardiovascular event.

===Mechanisms===
The hemostatic and fibrinolytic systems appear to play an important role in cardiovascular health&lt;ref&gt;Imhof A, Koenig W. Exercise and thrombosis. Cardiology clinics. 2001;19(3):389--400.&lt;/ref&gt;. Fibrin is an insoluble, fibrous protein involved in the formation of a blood clot. Elevated levels of fibrin pose an increased risk of thrombosis&lt;ref&gt;Wada H, Kobayashi T, Abe Y, Hatada T, Yamada N, Sudo A et al. Elevated levels of soluble fibrin or D-dimer indicate high risk of thrombosis. Journal of Thrombosis and Haemostasis. 2006;4(6):1253--1258&lt;/ref&gt;. Fibrinolysis or the fibrinolytic system is the enzymatic breakdown of the fibrin in blood clots. Chronic exercise may decrease coagulation potential and increase fibrinolytic potential in healthy individuals and cardiovascular disease (CVD) patients&lt;ref&gt;11. Koenig W, Ernst E. Exercise and thrombosis. Coronary artery disease. 2000;11(2):123--127&lt;/ref&gt;. It can be concluded that chronic aerobic exercise may induce favourable adaptations that reduce the likelihood of an ischemic event occurring both at rest and during physical exertion&lt;ref&gt;11. Koenig W, Ernst E. Exercise and thrombosis. Coronary artery disease. 2000;11(2):123--127&lt;/ref&gt;.

Exercise may also reduce thrombotic tendency due to an increase in nitric oxide (NO)&lt;ref&gt;asaki Y, Noguchi T, Yamamoto E, Giddings J, Ikeda K, Yamamoto J et al. Effects of voluntary exercise on cerebral thrombosis and endothelial function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP/Izm). Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology. 2004;31(s2):47--48.&lt;/ref&gt;. This increase in NO is the result of enhanced expression of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) mRNA by which exercise is thought to induce&lt;ref&gt;asaki Y, Noguchi T, Yamamoto E, Giddings J, Ikeda K, Yamamoto J et al. Effects of voluntary exercise on cerebral thrombosis and endothelial function in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRSP/Izm). Clinical and Experimental Pharmacology and Physiology. 2004;31(s2):47--48.&lt;/ref&gt;. The synthesis of NO results in the phosphorylation of several proteins that cause smooth muscle relaxation and subsequent vasodilation&lt;ref&gt;Weller, Richard, Could the sun be good for your heart? TedxGlasgow March 2012, posted January 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. Lower blood pressure as a result of vasodilation is a favourable outcome in reducing thrombotic likelihood as well as other cardiovascular diseases&lt;ref&gt;Lip G. Hypertension, Platelets, and the Endothelium The “Thrombotic Paradox” of Hypertension (or “Birmingham Paradox”) Revisited. Hypertension. 2003;41(2):199--200&lt;/ref&gt;.

It is also well-documented that exercise improves one's insulin sensitivity&lt;ref&gt;Borghouts L, Keizer H. Exercise and insulin sensitivity: a review. International journal of sports medicine. 2000;21(01):1--12&lt;/ref&gt;. This is favourable in that individuals possessing poor insulin sensitivity can often lead to too much insulin being released from the pancreas, this is known as hyperinsulinemia. Hyperinsulinemia as an independent factor, has been shown to contribute to endothelial damage and initiate an atherosclerotic process, which can subsequently lead to thrombosis&lt;ref&gt;Insulin Causes Endothelial Dysfunction in Humans&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore improving one's insulin sensitivity through exercise may reduce thrombotic tendency.

Changes in lipid profile is another favourable outcome by which exercise causes. A reduction in low-density lipoproteins (LDL) is important in decreasing the likelihood of atherosclerosis&lt;ref&gt;Ramachandran S, Penumetcha M, Merchant N, Santanam N, Rong R, Parthasarathy S. Exercise reduces preexisting atherosclerotic lesions in LDL receptor knock out mice. Atherosclerosis. 2005;178(1):33--38&lt;/ref&gt;. Atherosclerosis and thrombosis are closely related vascular problems and a reduction in atherosclerosis is likely to reduce thrombotic tendency&lt;ref&gt;Holvoet P, Collen D. Oxidized lipoproteins in atherosclerosis and thrombosis. The FASEB journal. 1994;8(15):1279--1284&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Recommendations===
There is a lack of evidence for exercise recommendations for thrombosis as a stand-alone disease. Thrombosis however is considered a cardiovascular disease and thrombotic individuals are advised to follow the same exercise recommendations of:

* 30 minutes or more of moderate-intensity physical activity on most, if not all days of the week&lt;ref&gt;Briffa T, Maiorana A, Allan R, others. of the Executive Working Group and National Forum Participants, 2006, National Heart Foundation of Australia Physical Activity Recommendations for People with Cardiovascular Disease, National Heart Foundation of Australia. Families, Incomes and Jobs, Volume 2. 2007;2002:100&lt;/ref&gt;,
* Moderate-intensity resistance training on at least two days per week&lt;ref&gt;Briffa T, Maiorana A, Allan R, others. of the Executive Working Group and National Forum Participants, 2006, National Heart Foundation of Australia Physical Activity Recommendations for People with Cardiovascular Disease, National Heart Foundation of Australia. Families, Incomes and Jobs, Volume 2. 2007;2002:100&lt;/ref&gt;.

It is important to cease exercising if experiencing:
 
* Feelings of nausea
* Chest pain
* Dizziness
* Headaches
* Numbness

These are potential early signs of a cardiovascular event.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHP PHP] (stands for PHP Hypertext Preprocessor) is a programming language for processing web requests. When you use a browser to request or fetch a web page you are sending a request to the server. The web server know how to use the URL to find the file and send it back to your browser. PHP allows us to create programs on the web server and when the programs are requested the server send the output from the programs as the response. For this to work, the web server must know how to handle PHP files. Most web servers have the PHP module installed and when they see a request for a PHP file they will forward the request to the PHP module. The PHP module will parse the request parameters and invoke the requested PHP code.

This is a powerful idea. With PHP you can create programs on a web server that can dynamically create web pages using data sources from files to databases to other web services. Even though it is a simple request-response model on top of the web client-server model, we can be create powerful web applications by breaking down complicated interactions to a series of request-response cycles. 

PHP is a scripting language. We create our programs as text files, which are also the executables. When a program is executed the PHP interpreter reads the source/executable file and execute one line of code at a time. Your PHP code can be tested on the server by using the interpreter as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
$php my_php_code.php
&lt;/source&gt;

==PHP Basic Syntax==
In a PHP file you can intermix PHP code and static content. When the file is executed only the PHP code gets executed. The output from the code replaces the code part forming the output of the program with the static content intact. This design makes it easy to generate web pages using a template and injecting dynamic content into parts of the page. 

A [http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_syntax.asp PHP code block] is defined using a tag as shown in the example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;My hello world page&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;?php
echo &quot;Hello World!&quot;;
?&gt;

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Please check out the following tutorials on w3schools.com to learn basic PHP syntax:
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_syntax.asp code block and comment]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_variables.asp variables]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_echo_print.asp echo and print]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_datatypes.asp data types]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_operators.asp operators]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_operators.asp if-else]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_switch.asp switch]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_looping.asp while/do-while loop]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_looping_for.asp for loop]

===Examples===
&lt;source lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My TODO list&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;?php
      $todos = array(&quot;Buy milk&quot;, &quot;Buy eggs&quot;, &quot;Read a book&quot;);
      $todo_count = 3;
      for ($i=0; $i&lt;$todo_count; $i++){
        echo &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot;.$todos[$i].&quot;&lt;/li&gt;\n&quot;;
      }
    ?&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The HTML generate by the previous PHP script is as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My TODO list&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;Buy milk&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Buy eggs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read a book&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The indentation is not what we expected and we could print the space or the tab characters from the PHP script but it would be very tedious. Instead we can use expression blocks to inject dynamic contents to the static ones as shown in the following example.
&lt;source lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My TODO list&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;?php
      $todos = array(&quot;Buy milk&quot;, &quot;Buy eggs&quot;, &quot;Read a book&quot;);
      $todo_count = 3;
      for ($i=0; $i&lt;$todo_count; $i++){?&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;?=$todos[$i]?&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
    &lt;?php  }
    ?&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;My TODO list&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;?php
      $todos = file(&quot;todolist.txt&quot;);
      $todo_count = count($todos);
      for ($i=0; $i&lt;$todo_count; $i++){
        echo &quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot;.$todos[$i].&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;;
      }
    ?&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==PHP String Functions==
Functions are reusable blocks of code. PHP has a set of build-in [http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_string.asp string functions] for manipulating strings.  A partial list of string functions is as follows:
*[http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_string_strlen.asp strlen()]
*[http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_string_strpos.asp strpos()]
*[http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_string_substr.asp substr()]
*[http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_string_strcmp.asp strcmp()]
*[http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_string_explode.asp explode()]
*[http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_string_implode.asp implode()]
*[http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_string.asp complete list] of string functions.

The explode function allows us to &quot;unpack&quot; a string into a array of substrings. The following code
&lt;source lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  $items = explode(&quot;:&quot;, &quot;item1:item2:item3&quot;);
  print_r($items);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
will output
&lt;syntaxHighlight lang=bash&gt;
 Array
(
    [0] =&gt; item1
    [1] =&gt; item2
    [2] =&gt; item3
)
&lt;/syntaxHighlight&gt;
You can name the substrings using the list notation. The following code
&lt;source lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  list($a, $b) = explode(&quot;:&quot;, &quot;item1:item2:item3&quot;);
  print &quot;a=&quot;.$a.&quot;\n&quot;;
  print &quot;b=&quot;.$b;
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
will output 
&lt;syntaxHighlight lang=bash&gt;
a=item1
b=item2
&lt;/syntaxHighlight&gt;
The implode function packs a array of strings into a single string.

==PHP Array Functions==
[http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_arrays.asp Python array] allows us to refer to a collection of items using a single variable. The items can be of any datatype including array (how multi-dimensional arrays are created). The size of a Python array is not fixed. In fact there are functions that allow you to treat an array as a queue or a list. Some example array functions are as follows:
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_array.asp array()]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_array_count.asp count()]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_array_list.asp list()]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_array_push.asp array_push()]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_array_pop.asp array_pop()]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_array_slice.asp array_slice()]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_array_splice.asp array_splice()] 
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_array_shift.asp array_shift()]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_array_unshift.asp array_unshift()]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_array_sort.asp sort()]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_array_rsort.asp rsort()]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_array.asp complete list] of array functions

==PHP Global Variables==
[http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_superglobals.asp PHP superglobal variables] are a set of predefined variables that are always accessible to all PHP scripts on the server. 

They are:
* $GLOBALS
* $_SERVER
* $_REQUEST
* $_POST
* $_GET
* $_FILES
* $_ENV
* $_COOKIE
* $_SESSION

The following script
&lt;source lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  print_r($_SERVER);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
will output content similar to 

 Array ( 
 [HTTP_HOST] =&gt; 198.209.99.99 
 [HTTP_CONNECTION] =&gt; keep-alive 
 [HTTP_CACHE_CONTROL] =&gt; max-age=0 
 [HTTP_ACCEPT] =&gt; text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/webp,*/*;q=0.8 
 [HTTP_USER_AGENT] =&gt; Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/37.0.2062.122 Safari/537.36 
 [HTTP_ACCEPT_ENCODING] =&gt; gzip,deflate,sdch 
 [HTTP_ACCEPT_LANGUAGE] =&gt; en-US,en;
 ...

As you can see the server gets all kinds of information from the client through the HTTP request sent and makes the information available to the PHP scripts via the $_SERVER variable.

If we request the following script using the following URL: http://host/path/to/test.php?first_name=Curious&amp;last_name=George the script will echo back the parameters sent   via this request.
&lt;source lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  print_r($_REQUEST);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
The actual output is 
 Array ( [first_name] =&gt; Curious [last_name] =&gt; George )

$_REQUEST is an associative array with strings as indices. You can refer to the elements in the array by their names, for example $_REQUEST[&quot;first_name&quot;] will give you the value of &quot;Curious&quot;. If you expect a parameter to be sent to your script via the query string you can attempt to get it through this $_REQUEST variable. The following script test whether the parameter is sent and echoes &quot;first_name parameter is missing.&quot; if the parameter is not provided in the query string.
&lt;source lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  $first_name = $_REQUEST[&quot;first_name&quot;];
  if (isset($_REQUEST[&quot;first_name&quot;])){
    print &quot;first_name=&quot;.$first_name;
  }else{
    print &quot;first_name parameter is missing.&quot;;
  }
&lt;/source&gt;

==PHP File Functions==
PHP file functions allows us to access and manipulate the filesystem on the server on which our PHP scripts are executed. The basic file functions include reading content from a file or a directory and writing to a file. Some commonly used file functions are as follows:
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_file.asp file()]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_file_get_contents.asp file_get_contents()]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_file_put_contents.asp file_put_contents()]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_glob.asp glob()]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/func_filesystem_basename.asp basename()]
* [http://www.w3schools.com/php/php_ref_filesystem.asp complete list] of file functions

The following PHP script reads a poem from a file and outputs it as a ordered list.
&lt;source lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;?php
  $lines = file(&quot;poem.txt&quot;);
  foreach ($lines as $line){
?&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;&lt;?=$line?&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;?php
  }
?&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
The output will appear as follows in a browser window:
 1. All that is gold does not glitter,
 2. Not all those who wander are lost;
 3. The old that is strong does not wither,
 4. Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
 5. From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
 6. A light from the shadows shall spring;
 7. Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
 8. The crownless again shall be king.

&lt;source lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;

Reading a directory is similar to reading a file except that the result is a list of files and directories of the directory we are reading. The '''glob''' function allows us to scan a directory to read items (file or directory) that matches a pattern. The following script  reads names of text files that are in the &quot;word&quot; subdirectory, which is under the directory that contains the script. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  $file_names = glob(&quot;words/*.txt&quot;);
  print_r($file_names);
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
As shown in the output below the array returned from the glob function contains relative paths to the files, which makes it easy to read the files (next example).
 Array ( [0] =&gt; words/hits.txt [1] =&gt; words/words.txt )

The next script takes the paths to the files, reads the file contents, and echoes them back to the caller.
&lt;source lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php
  $files = glob(&quot;words/*.txt&quot;);
  foreach ($files as $file){
    $content = file_get_contents($file);
?&gt;
  &lt;h1&gt;&lt;?=basename($file)?&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;?=$content ?&gt;
&lt;?php
}
?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
A sample output of the script is as follows. The basename function returns the path's last component, which is the &quot;bare&quot; file name.
&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;h1&gt;hits.txt&lt;/h1&gt;
 123
 &lt;h1&gt;words.txt&lt;/h1&gt;
 prothalamion	noun	a song in celebration of a marriage
 atrabilious	adjective	given to or marked by melancholy; GLOOMY
 hyacinth	noun	a precious stone of the ancients sometimes held to be the  sapphire; a gem zircon or essonite
&lt;/pre&gt;
==PHP Include Statement==
PHP include statement copies the content of another file into the current file where the include statement appears. For example, the following statement will &quot;include&quot; the output of the navigation.php script (e.g. HTML code for a navigation bar) into its own output. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;PHP&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php include &quot;navigation.php&quot;; ?&gt;

;Purpose and usage
This is a '''&quot;Short&quot;''' variation on the {{Tl|Lorem}} template,: primarily used in template usage, or debugging things like tables.
* The template generates single Latin sentences from the standard typesetter's [[w:Lorem ipsum|Lorem ipsum boilerplate]].
* Defining the first {{TG|placeholder parameter}} {{BL|'''&lt;nowiki&gt;{{{1}}} or '| 1='&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''}} any one of the values {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt; {V : {a, A, 1}, {b, B, 2}, {c, C, 3}, or {d, D, 4}&lt;nowiki&gt;}&lt;/nowiki&gt; &lt;/code&gt;}} ''selects &lt;u&gt;just one&lt;/u&gt;'' of the four different Latin sentences of about the same length; the longest (barely) being the default ''''A'''' phrase shown above.

;See also:the long forms
* {{tl|Lorem Ipsum}}, the source of that Latin paragraph.
* {{tl|Lorem}}, can be used to call THAT source template up to 4 times.

==== '''Background''' ====

Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASDs) are a collection of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by atypical development in social interactions and communication skills.  People with an ASD can also present with repetitive and stereotypical behaviours and interests and activities.  Decreased communication and social interaction domains such as reduced eye contact, atypical social reciprocity, and verbal and nonverbal communication delays are all typical of children with an ASD.&lt;ref&gt;Tonge, B., Brereton, A. (2010). What is Autism?. ACT-Now Fact Sheet 1. www.med.monash.edu.au/spppm/research/devpsych/actnow.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;perspectives&quot;&gt;Srinivasan, S. M., Pescatello, L. S., Bhat, A. N. (2014). Current Perspectives on Physical Activity and Exercise Recommendations for Children and Adolescents With Autism Spectrum Disorders. American Physical Therapy Association. 94:6. pp 875-889.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;understanding&quot;&gt;Rosser Sandt, D. D., Frey, G. C., Pan, C-Y. (2005). Understanding Physical Activity in Youths with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Palaestra. 21:4. pp. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Autism is more frequent in boys than girls and will affect the person throughout their life.  There are no cures available for this syndrome.  Other developmental disorders including Asperger’s disorder and Pervasive Development Disorder – Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS) along with Autistic Disorder are classed as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD’s) and are usually diagnosed during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;McPartland, J., Volkmar, F. R. (2013). Autism and Related Disorders. NIH Public Access. 106.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==== '''Identification''' ====

For most cases of an ASD parents will be worried about their child’s development and will seek medical advice after observing strange behaviours and not meeting milestones.&lt;ref name=&quot;firstsigns&quot;&gt;http://firstsigns.org/. Viewed on 27th September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Medical practitioners will then assess the child and determine if further investigation is necessary.

==== '''Treatments for Autism Spectrum Disorders''' ====

There are no treatments for ASDs directly but some pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions can be used to treat the interfering symptoms which if left untreated can diminish the quality of life for themselves and caregivers.&lt;ref&gt;Wink, K. L., et. al. (2010). Expert Opinions in Emerging Drugs. NIH Public Access. 15:3. pp 481-494. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	
====== &lt;u&gt;Pharmaceutical&lt;/u&gt; ======
Medication that is prescribed to ASD sufferers are used to provide some relief to the associated symptoms that are typical of ASDs.  Before pharmaceutical intervention is prescribed, pediatric professionals must assess whether the benefits of the medication outweigh the negative side-effects.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/treatment.html. Viewed 26th September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the symptoms that are treated with medication are:&lt;br /&gt;
•	Repetitive and stereotypical behaviour,&lt;br /&gt;
•	Hyperactivity and inattention,&lt;br /&gt;
•	Irritability (including aggression, self-injurious behaviour and severe tantrums),&lt;br /&gt;
•	And core social impairments.&lt;br /&gt;

Drugs used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) such as psychostimulants have been used to control hyperactivity in ASD sufferers.  Atypical antipsychotics are clinically used to target irritability (including aggression, self-injurious behaviour and severe tantrums). No medication has been approved for use to improve core social impairments as none trialed have shown improvements in socialization and communication.&lt;ref&gt;Wink, K. L., et. al. (2010). Emerging Drugs for the Treatment of Symptoms Associated with Autism Spectrum Disorders. Expert Opinions in Emerging Drugs. NIH Public Access. 15:3. pp. 481-494.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== &lt;u&gt;Other interventions&lt;/u&gt; =====

Early diagnosis and behavioural therapy interventions have shown to improve the quality of life and helps to support families through the initial stages. &lt;ref name=&quot;firstsigns&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the interventions can be found below with links to more information on each.
# [http://www.lovaas.com/lovaasnote.php Dr. Ivor Lovaas] has over 40 years experience with supporting and implementing behavioural interventions for people with an ASD.  For a outline of what his program offers click [http://www.lovaas.com/services_clinic.php here].&lt;br /&gt;  
# For Australian families this [http://www.abia.net.au/applied_behavioural_analysis link] will take you to information and resources that can be accessed in Australia.
# Early Intervention strategies are widely used with children under the age of 4 years of age.  [http://www.autismspectrum.org.au/content/early-intervention-0 Aspect ]is Australia's leading service provider for Autism and other disabilities.  They have a wide range of resources and information for families and care givers and can also help to locate further support in your area.

==== '''Physical Activity''' ====

Studies have shown that the prevalence of obesity in children with ASDs is 30.4% when compared to children of the same age without an ASD is currently at 23.6%.  Furthermore, people with ASDs have been found to be less likely to participate in physical activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;perspectives&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;understanding&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some reasons for non-participation in physical activity are:
* Sensory modulation problems may affect competence in play and lead to avoidance behaviours
* Behavioural problems or preferences (highly restricted interests, the need for inflexible schedules, and preference for highly predictable, structured activities) may lead to limited activity choices
* Environmental factors such as lack of time and resources or unsupportive peer groups will affect the physical activity levels of individuals with ASD&lt;ref name=&quot;perspectives&quot;/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

This shows a need for pediatricians and other health care providers to help ASD patients to become more active.  There is also a need for people in the fitness, sport and recreation industry to be given opportunities to expand their skills to become more inclusive of people with a disability.  

Gymnastics Australia has introduced a new program called Rebound Therapy.  This is a program aimed at any child with a disability or learning disorder and incorporates the use of trampolines as the physical activity.

The [http://www.gymnsw.org.au/?MenuID=Services_@_Development/20627/0,Rebound_Therapy/21415/23559/0 video] at the link describes the benefits of Rebound Therapy which include improvements in muscle development, balance, coordination, and most importantly social interaction and communication skills.  Research has shown that the use of Rebound Therapy along with additional exercises decreases the frequency of challenging behaviours and increases in quality of life (freedom scores) and alertness.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, M. C., et. al. (2007). Bahavioral and Psychosocial Outcomes of a 16-Week Rebound Therapy-Based Exercise Program for Poeple With Profound Intellectual Disabilities. Jrn of Policy and Practise in Intellectual Disabilities. 4:2. pp 111-119.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of aquatic environments are generally enjoyed by people with an ASD.  Studies have shown that the aquatic environment can be used to enhance learning and performance.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, J., Porretta, D. L. (2013). Enhancing the Motor Skills of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: A Pool-based Approach. Joperd: The journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance. 84:1. pp 41-45 &lt;/ref&gt;  Results show that improvements in water orientation skills, basic swimming skills, aquatic play skills, and health and motor related fitness.  Interestingly involvement in an aquatic environment has decreased stereotypical behaviours and increased social interactions.

The health benefits of physical activity is well documented and can improve the quality of life of the individual and decrease the likelihood of debilitating chronic disease or premature death in an individual later in life.  People with ASD will see the same benefits from regular physical activity as typically developed people along with additional benefits including increased social interactions and communication skills making it a vital part of their treatment.

==== '''Recommendations''' ====

Regular participation in physical activity for individuals with an Autism Spectrum Disorder should be a regular strategy in their management plan.  Medical practitioners should encourage people with an ASD to utilize the sport and recreation providers in their area to help integrate and practice behavioural skills learnt in therapy sessions and with a fun and engaging program may help these people live more healthy lifestyles.  The benefits received by individuals with ASDs from physical activity complement other intervention strategies and will reinforce what is taught in the clinical settings.  Some sporting bodies have well established programs for special needs clients but a wider range of resources and education needs to be supported for further development in a wider range of sports and recreation activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;understanding&quot;/&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;

Insomnia is a sleep disorder in which their is an inability to fall asleep, poor sleep quality or difficulty in staying asleep for a desired period of time.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, T. (2007). &quot;Insomnia: Definition, prevalence, etiology, and consequences&quot;. Journal of clinical sleep medicine: 3 (5 Suppl): S7–10&lt;/ref&gt; It is now considered to be the most prevalent sleep disorder&lt;ref&gt;Passos, GS. et al. (2010). Effect of acute physical exercise on patients with chronic primary insomnia. Journal Clinical Sleep Medicine. Vol: 6(3), 270-275.&lt;/ref&gt; and is associated comorbidities such as:
*Depression and anxiety&lt;ref name= Lee/&gt;
*Loss of functional ability and slowed reaction time&lt;ref name= Lee/&gt;
*Loss of productivity and sleepiness &lt;ref name= Lee/&gt;
*High blood Pressure&lt;ref name= Lee/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;
*Risk of diabetes, heart disease and poor immune function&lt;ref name= Lee/&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;Buysse, D. J., Angst, J., Gamma, A., Ajdacic, V., Eich, D., &amp; Rössler, W. (2008). Prevalence, course, and comorbidity of insomnia and depression in young adults. Sleep, Vol:31(4), pp.473&lt;/ref&gt;
In terms of treatment, exercise may have a positive or negative effect on an individual. Negatively causing an individual to show symptoms of exercise induced insomnia&lt;ref name=m/&gt; or positively may be an inexpensive way in improving insomnia &lt;ref name= Faulkner&gt;Faulkner G, Taylor H.(2005) Exercise Health and Mental Health: Emerging Relationships&lt;/ref&gt; and other sleep disorders such as [[w:Sleep_apnea|sleep apnea]].The positive health benefits and effects on insomnia from exercise far out way the risk of experiencing exercise induced insomnia.&lt;ref name=m/&gt;

=== Issue ===
Insomnia is  most common in the elderly although can occur at any age with it affecting approximately 15% of adults.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, J. F. (2008). &quot;Insomnia&quot;. Annals of Internal Medicine. 148&lt;/ref&gt; It can be short (&lt;3 weeks) or a long term problem (&gt; 3 weeks)&lt;ref&gt;Zahn, Dorothy (2003). &quot;Insomnia: CPJRPC&quot;. The Canadian Pharmaceutical Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;. Severe insomnia is most prevaent in women then men and is classified as less then 3.5 hours of sleep for women and less then 4.5 hours for men.&lt;ref name=k&gt; Kripke, D. F et al. (2002). &quot;Mortality associated with sleep duration and insomnia&quot;. Archives of general psychiatry. vol.59 (20) pp. 131–136&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2004, sleep disorders had a financial direct and indirect cost of $4524 Million in Australia. &lt;ref&gt;Hillman, D. R., Murphy, A. S., Antic, R., &amp; Pezzullo, L. (2006).

== Exercise Induced Insomnia ==
Exercise induced insomnia can be defined as a disruption to sleep quality or prolonged sleep latency caused by late night exercise, particularly of vigorous intensity.&lt;ref name=m/&gt; Exercises causes a rush in adrenaline and an elevated heart rate which can cause many people to have trouble falling sleeping and cause much arousal.&lt;ref name=m/&gt; Adequate amounts of sleep is necessary in order to gain maximal recovery from exercise, and if sleep induced insomnia occurs this can cause many physiological and psychological problems associated from [http://www.webmd.com/sleep-disorders/excessive-sleepiness-10/10-results-sleep-loss lack of sleep]&lt;ref name=m&gt;Myllymaki T, et al. (2011). Effects of vigorous late-night exercise on sleep quality and cardiac autonomic activity. Journal of Sleep Research. vol.20 (146)&lt;/ref&gt;. Exercise raises the concentration of stress hormones and body temperature which has the potential to cause insomnia in some individuals&lt;ref name=m/&gt;. This condition is uncommon even in those who participate in late night vigorous physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;Vuori I et al. (1988) Epidemiology of exercise effects on sleep. Europe PubMed Central. vol. 574. pp 3-7]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Exercise as a Treatment ==
Research suggests when it comes to improving insomnia, exercise is one of the best non-pharmaceutical medicine's that an individual can participate in&lt;ref name=g&gt; Girdwain, J, Mcgee, K. (2013). Fix It with Fitness. Health, vol. 27, (4)&lt;/ref&gt; due to reducing anxiety, &lt;ref name=g/&gt;depression, &lt;ref name=g/&gt; and release of stress.&lt;ref name=g/&gt;Exercise also has the effect of reducing Primary insomnia in individuals, this is based on the hypothesis that sleep is an energy restoring system that maintains body temperature and rebuilds body cells. &lt;ref name=y/&gt; Much energy is expelled from exercise therefore the body needs restoration in order to function.&lt;ref name=y&gt; Youngstedt, S.D. (2005). Effects of Exercise on Sleep. Clinics in Sports Medicine, vol 24 (2)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The benefits of exercise on insomnia are:
*Exercise raise's body temperature which warms the neurons in the hypothalamus that are involved in activating sleeping mechanism.&lt;ref name=Faulkner/&gt;
*Reduces anxiety by lowering blood pressure.&lt;ref name=Faulkner/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;
*Has antidepressant effects by releasing serotonin (neurotransmitter involved in mood enhancement) and releases [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endorphins endorphin's] &lt;ref name=Faulkner/&gt; promoting sleep quality. 

=== Types of training ===
&lt;u&gt;Effects from Aerobic Training&lt;/u&gt;
* Aerobic exercise is an effective treatment to improve insomnia, sleep quality and quality of life in older adults.&lt;ref&gt;Reid K.J et al,(2010). Aerobic exercise improves self-reported sleep and quality of life in older adults with insomnia, Sleep Medicine Vol: 11, (9) Pp 934–940    &lt;/ref&gt;
*Improves sleep duration, less sleep onset latency, and is shown to improve physiological building processes involved in recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Brassington, S., &amp; Hicks, A. (1995). Aerobic exercise and self-reported sleep quality in elderly individuals. Journal Of Aging &amp; Physical Activity. Vol: 3(2), pp.120-134&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reduces depression anxiety, stress, enhances mood and promotes relaxation.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, P., &amp; Dennis, A. (2002) Physical exercise for sleep problems in adults aged 60+. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, 1(4), pp.1-12&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Effects from resistance Training&lt;/u&gt;
*Resistance training is found to improve sleep quality demonstrated in a study by Ferris et al. in 2005, which tested sleep quality measured by the Pittsburgh sleep quality index scale after a 3 month resistance training intervention in older adults&lt;ref name=f&gt;Ferris et al. (2005) Resistance Training Improves Sleep Quality in Older Adults a Pilot Study. J Sports Sci Med. Vol. 4 (3) pp. 354-360&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*Circuit resistance training utilizing major muscle groups such as the legs, demonstrate the best results.&lt;ref name=f/&gt;
 
=== Recommended Exercise Protocols ===
*Resistance and aerobic training of moderate intensity is recommended to best combat insomnia.&lt;ref name=h&gt;Holbrook, AM., Crowther, R., Lotter, A., Cheng, C., King, D. (2000). The diagnosis and management of insomnia in clinical practice: a practical evidence-based approach. Canadian Medical Association Journal. 1Vol: 62(2): 216-220&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*exercise at least 3-4 hours before desired sleep time in order to reduce risk of exercise induced insomnia. &lt;ref name=m/&gt;
*Do not over train as high stress levels are associated with insomnia. &lt;ref name=m/&gt;
*Monitor eating times with exercise, as large amounts of food requires a large digestion time which can keep your body awake.&lt;ref name=m/&gt;
