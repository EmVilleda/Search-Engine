[[Image:I-80 Eastshore Fwy.jpg|thumb|[Figure 1. Interstate 80]]
Flow in network science is a broadly used concept.  Flows apply to all network types and takes on different meanings.  A broad definition for flow is the quantity of movements past a point during a time period movements.  The entity of movement can be a liquid, a solid, a gas or even a concept.  Types of networks and examples of related flows include:

•	Computer networks: Flow of binary units (bits), 1 mbps = 1,000,000 bits per second

•	Hydraulic networks: Flow of a liquid: gallons per minute or barrels per day (oil)

•	Shipping network: Flow of a commodity: gross annual tonnage

•	Electrical networks: Flow of electrons, 1 Ampere = 6.241 X 1018 electrons (1 Coulomb) per sec second

In the topic of interest, transportation networks, vehicle movements are the focus and measured in vehicles per hour (vph).  Vehicular flow is dependent on vehicles density and speed.  The equation to measure flow is:
[[Image:TraditionalTrafficFlowModel.png|thumb|]]

&lt;big&gt;	''q=k*v''&lt;/big&gt;

where:

q=vehicle flow (vehicles per hour

k=density (vehicles per mile) 

v=average speed (mph)

A related measure used by traffic engineers is peak hour flow (PHF).  The PHF equation is:
	
&lt;big&gt;	''PHF = (peak 15-minute vehicle count) * 4''&lt;/big&gt;

To calculate, simply multiply the highest 15-minute volume by four.  This is a useful measurement for planners and engineers when designing for busiest-case scenario.  A situation where PHF is useful is when normal flows may be relatively low, but local activities cause traffic patterns fluctuate causing periodic “spikes” that may not be reflected during an hourly count.

The relationship between vehicle flow, density and average speed can be expressed graphically in what is known as Greenshield's model.  As demonstrated in the top left figure showing the flow-density relationship, there is a critical density where any addition vehicles in a segment will decrease total vehicles flow.  This is due to the incremental decrease in speed for each vehicle added as shown in the lower left graph.  

=== Nature of flows ===
Flow behave differently depending on the network type.  In electrical and hydraulic networks for example, flows are instantaneous throughout a link.  Any entering electrons or liquid at one end of a link will simultaneously force out the same amount at the other end.  In road networks, flows have a wavelike pattern.  There is a delay from the a change in speed at any given time.  A change in speed also occurs at different locations on a link.  This is referred to as a shockwave which is expressed in the equation:

&lt;math&gt;v_w  = \frac{{q_2  - q_1 }}{{k_2  - k_1 }} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;Hunter et al. Transportation Engineering. Oregon State University, Portland State University, University of Idaho. 2003.http://www.webs1.uidaho.edu/niatt_labmanual/Chapters/trafficflowtheory/theoryandconcepts/ShockWaves.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

where:

&lt;math&gt;v_w&lt;/math&gt;= the propagation velocity of the shockwave (mph)

&lt;math&gt;q_2&lt;/math&gt; = flow prior to change in conditions (vph)

&lt;math&gt;q_1&lt;/math&gt; = flow after change in conditions (vph)

&lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; = traffic density prior to change in conditions (vpm)

&lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; = traffic density after change in condition (vpm)

Figure 3 reveals graphically the delay in a change in velocity with respect with to time.  Here, the top line representing the first vehicle leads the remaining seven.  Note the increase in delay for each subsequant vehicle after the changes in speed of vehicle 1.  Figure 4 illustrates shockwave behavior with the free-flowing green vehicles coming upon denser conditions.  Note the positive or negative sign for shockwave velocity.  A positive number indicates a shockwave moving in the direction of traffic as a negative number indicates a counterflow direction.

== Walks ==
To further understand the behavior of flows, an overview of walks in a network setting is explored.  A walk is a sequence of arcs (and nodes) &lt;ref&gt;Floudas, Christodoulas A. and Panos M. Pardalos, “Encyclopedia of Optimization” Springer Verlag. 2nd Ed.” Vol 1. 2001: 295.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also could be thought of as a trajectory consisting of multiple steps &lt;ref name=&quot;Random&quot;&gt;“Random Walks” Wikipedia. 2011. Wikimedia Foundation, Inc.. 10 April 2011. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_walk &lt;/ref&gt;  There are two types of walks to consider, random and directed walks.

=== Random Walks ===
[[File:2D Random Walk 400x400.ogv|250px|thumb|none|Figure 5. An animated example of a [[Brownian motion]]-like random walk on a [[torus]].]]

Random walks consist of steps in which each step is independent of the prior step.  An arc or node may be utilized multiple times.  There is no defined destination and the direction of each step is random.  This walk is sometimes referred to as the “drunkard’s walk.”  The program (to be installed) is a two-dimensional illustration of a pixel which has eight possible directions for each successive step. Examples of random walks include an animal or insect foraging for food, stock market trends and a gambler’s funds.
Random walks can be used to describe flows in a road network.  Though a driver does not retrace a path (arc) or return to a just-visited intersection (node), random walks still play a role in road networks.  For starters, when a driver is new to an area and seeks to depart a location (e.g. a downtown setting after taking in a large event), a driver simply wishes to leave the area and may randomly try different roads.  Also playing a role is the early establishment of the road itself.  Many of today’s highways are predated by paths used by horse and buggy.  Even before horses and European settlers, native peoples established foot paths which some may be the result of trial and error foraging, which is a random walk.

=== Directed Walks ===
[[Image:Directed_Walk.png|300px|thumb|none|Figure 6. A Directed Walk]]
Directed walks consist of steps which do not retract to once-visited arcs or nodes.  These walks are oriented towards a final destination.  The figure at right illustrates a desired destination where the walk eventually terminates at the desired node.  Examples of directed walks include electricity, river flows, migrating animals and internet communications.

Directed walks are more applicable to flows in transportation networks than random walks.  Trips by motor vehicle typically have a destination and no road segment (arc) or intersection (node) is used more than once in a walk.  The establishing of a highway is also typically a directed walk.  Although the original path may be the result of random walks centuries ago, the new highway will connect the same nodes but often will select a slightly different route, depending on a number of factors such as topography, historical sites, environmental concerns, and the locations of existing buildings.  Also, some of the original paths predating today’s highways may have been decided by directed walks.  Though the first paths may be footpaths, many of these paths connected to a destination such as a neighboring community or body of water.

'''Essentially there are five references to a life after death: the quantum physics (Professor Dürr), the near death research (Pam Reynolds), the after death research (Karmapa), the reincarnation cases (Shanti Devi) and the statements of the enlightened (the clairvoyant). There are many facts that point to the survival of the soul after death. The more one looks at the current science, the more appear inexplicable things for a materialistic world view.'''

==Quantum Physics== 
Quantum physics has proven by physical tests that a higher dimension in the universe exists ([[w:Alain Aspect|Alain Aspect]]). The former head of the Max Planck Institute for Physics in Munich, Professor Hans-Peter Dürr believes that the brain by thinking forms a field of consciousness (quantum field) that can exist after the death of the body in the higher dimension further. 

* You are 78 years old. Do you believe in for afterlife? Is there existence after death? Professor Dürr: ''&quot;That is an interesting question. What we consider the here and now, this world, it is actually just the material level that is comprehensible. The beyond is an infinite reality that is much bigger. Which this world is rooted in. In this way, our lifes in this plane of existence are encompassed, surrounded, by the afterworld already. When planning I imagine that I have written my existence in this world on a sort of hard drive on the tangible (the brain), that I have also transferred this data onto the spiritual quantum field, then I could say that when I die, I do not lose this information, this conscioiusness. The body dies but the spiritual quantum field continues. In this way, I am immortal. &quot;(P.M. Magazin 05/2007)''

==Near Death Research==
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - Death's arrest.jpg|thumb|300px|Death arrives.]]
The doctor [[w:Elisabeth Kübler-Ross|Elisabeth Kübler-Ross]] published her book „Interviews with the Dying“ in 1969. This book caused an extensive discussion concerning death in Western societies. Kübler-Ross stumbled upon the amazing fact '''that many people were able to encounter the other side''' during their brief deaths (before they returned to their bodies and to life). 
 
During their lives on Earth, '''blind people can sometimes suddenly see from the other side.''' They can observe what happens on earth from the beyond. How could a blind person suddenly get knocked unconscious during the course of a car accident and then be able to see other people in the area of the accident and then describe the circumstances after being revived?
 
Especially well-known is the so-called dentures incident. An older man was taken to a hospital in the Netherlands to be operated. His dentures were taken out so that his throat could be more easily accessed. During the hustle and bustle of the operation, a nurse misplaced the dentures and couldn’t find them. '''Luckily, the man left his body during the operation and watched the nurse from above. After he returned to consciousness, the man was able to tell the nurse exactly where she had put his dentures.'''
 
In 1975 [[w:Raymond Moody|Raymond Moody]] wrote the book „Life After Death“. In this book, '''he documented the near-death experiences of 150 people. Many reported that after death they travelled through a dark tunnel and then arrived at a dimension of light. In the light world, they met holy light beings and even their already death relatives.''' They learned things they didn’t know before. After their near-death experiences, many people changed their lives completely and then oriented themselves around spirituality.
 
Many researchers have looked into the insight of Kübler-Ross and Moody. With a flood of arguments against these findings, the researchers tried to prove the near-death researchers wrong. The typical argument of such naysayers was usually that the near-death visions were biochemical (material) or psychic reactions of the mind caused by nearing death. Before death, it is alleged, humans have hallucinations. The brain reacts to death with a flood of hormones.
 
One of these main critics was '''Dr. Michael Sabom.''' After he read Moody’s book, he stated that he had looked into these matters thoroughly himself. He interviewed over a hundred patients, who after experiencing cardiac arrest, were revived. '''Sabom was amazed to find that these people had seen things outside of their bodies which they didn’t know before,''' that they witnessed things while unconscious.
 
The biggest scientific breakthrough for Sabom occurred in 1991 with Pam Reynolds. '''The special aspect of the case of Pam Reynolds lies with the fact that modern measurement equipment showed that the consciousness of a person exists even when the stuff of the brain is shut off. This leads one to conclude that there must be an independent consciousness separate from the body.''' The body and soul are two independent manifestations of energy.
 
The case of Pam Reynolds was tested with many other patients. They confirmed Sabom’s results. It was confirmed that the [[w:Near death experience|near-death experiences]] were not only of a biochemical nature or simply brain processes. They are independent of age, gender, religion, and of country of origin of the involved people. Scientific breakthrough occurred with the case of Pam Reynolds in 1991. Further tests ([[w:de:Pim van Lommel|Pim van Lommel]] in Holland in 2001, Sam Parnia from the University of South Hampton in 2001) confirmed Sabom’s results.

===Pam Reynolds===

1991 the 35 year-old [[w:Pam Reynolds (singer)|Pam Reynolds]] underwent a brain operation. Her blood was routed from her brain and she was placed in a state of artificial coma. Her head was attached with wires to measure brain waves. It was ascertained that no brain waves could travel during this half an hour. '''The thought processes were blocked, and examined as no hormone release could occur. Hallucinations were not possible in this state. And it just so happened that Pam Reynolds had her out of body experience at this time.''' 

She floated with her soul out of her body. She observed from above all of the details of her operation. She then floated through a tunnel to a world of light. There, she met her dead grandmother and other people. The beings there lived in a paradise dimension and possessed positive energy. With their energy, they strengthened Ms. Reynolds so that she could go through her operation successfully. '''In a BBC interview, Pam Reynolds explained that she had experienced the breath of God.''' 

--&gt; [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WNbdUEqDB-k Video Pam Reynolds]

===German Television on Near-Death Research===
 
In 2003, a program appeared on German television dealing with the topic of near-death research. Regine Kexel portrayed the arguments of the supporters and opponents of the soul theory according to the book ''Dimension Psi'' from [[w:de:Walter von Lucadou|Walter von Lucadou]] and came to the conclusion that there are many reports about near death research that cannot simply be ignored.
 
Regine Kexel presented the aforementioned arguments, and all the arguments of the opponents to the soul theory were refuted. The independence of the consciousness is currently the accepted view of science, in the words of Regine Kexel (translated from German): '''“Critics of near-death research are hard pressed to find a plausible reason for this phenomenon.”.'''
 
According to her opinion, we are positioned at the very beginning of a large puzzle. Here is where we must differ. Those who are concerned with [[w:Spirituality|spirituality]] already have an answer to the presented questions. The enlightened masters of the past have discovered the mysteries. One only needs to look further to find an answer to these questions.
 
For example, it is not entirely clear to the program moderator Kexel as to why not all those who brush with death go through have a near death experience as described. '''With adults, 30% go through this, and children to a percentage of 70%.''' The explanation for this is that most adults are so tied with their consciousness to their physical bodies that they remain in their bodies in these near death situations. Children have yet to really connect their spirits with their material bodies in such a strong way, and for this reason they leave their bodies more easily.
 
Careful consideration '''also raises the question as to why, when the reason for these near death experiences is only due to hormones and a lack of oxygen, and hallucinations, then do children and adults have such an unbelievable difference in the rate with which these near death experiences occur?'''

==After Death Research==
[[File:Danse_macabre_by_Michael_Wolgemut.png|thumb|300px|Dancing death.]]
Enlightened Tibetan masters traditionally stay in their bodies for three days after death. This is recognized by the fact that their bodies do not begin to decompose and that the heart chakra is warm. This fact can be explained with the continuation of life after death.''' The [[w:Karmapa|16th Karmapa]] died in 1981 in a hospital in Chicago. He stayed three days after his death with his soul in his body. The body did not rot in that time and the heart region was warm.''' Dr. Levy cared for him until his death: 

*''„48 hours after his death, his chest was still warm. In this moment, my hands were both warm, and his chest was warmer than my hand. In order to test this, I moved my hands to the side of his chest, away from his heart, and there it was cold. I then felt the middle again, and above his heart it was warm. I pinched his skin and found that it was still elastic and completely normal. After 36 hours, the dead typically have skin comparable to dough. And his skin was still like that of the living after 48 hours. It was as if he weren’t dead. Shortly after we left the room, the surgeon came and said, „ he is warm, he is warm.“ And then it came to be that the medical staff asked again and again if he were still warm. It was naturally consistent to the traditional Tibetan experience.  Developed individuals like his Holiness stay in their bodies after breath and heartbeat have stopped, within a state of deep meditation. After three days the Samadhi ended. It was recognized that his Holiness was no longer warm and that the process of death set in. After this, the atmosphere changed, it too became normal.”''([http://www.buddhismus-heute.de/archive.issue__37.position__5.de.html Quotes buddhismus-heute.de])

==Reincarnation Research==
[[File:Vishnu Mandala.jpg|thumb|300px|Vishnu and his many lifes.]]
'''The [[w:reincarnation|reincarnation research]] approaches more and more to the fact that there are past lives. Thousands of reports were investigated . The witnesses could accurately describe the previous places and situations, although they were never there and had heard nothing about it in the normal way.''' The most well-known reincarnation researcher in the West is Professor Ian Stevenson from the University of Virginia. He examined over the course of 40 years over 3.000 reincarnations situations throughout the world. Often, he noticed similarities in behavior and bodily signals in line with the former incarnation. 

'''One of the most well-known cases of reincarnation in India is [[w:Shanti Devi|Shanti Devi]]. She was born in 1926 in New Delhi and could remember her previous life as a house wife in Mathura.''' Although she was never in that location, she was able to describe her previous husband, her previous house, and the city itself. She could even remember where she had always hidden her money in her former life. 

*[[v:User:Nobody60|Nobody60]], ''&quot;My beliefs are based mainly on my own experiences. I have seen thousand previous lives in the course of my spiritual cleansing processes. After seven years as a Yogi, I was suddenly overcome by the wish to know my earlier life. I went back in my meditation to a previous time and felt resonance with a particular time. I felt a sort of resistance, and looked in that direction and could spiritually “see” four earlier lives. After eleven years as a Yogi, many former lives came in dreams to the surface of my consciousness. Differing from the conscious perceptions while meditating, very clear film-like scenes- appeared. I could see the details of the situations and the environment I was in at the time of the previous life. From the single pictures I could see geographical details.&quot;''([http://knol.google.com/k/nils-horn/the-science-of-proving-god-s-existence/d0nwq0okqs4d/28 The Science of Proving God’s Existence])

==The Statements of the Enlightened==
[[File:Amitabha.JPG|thumb|200px|Enlightened Buddha.]]
Who is enlightened can, thanks to its expanded consciousness, look in the beyond and know the life after death. One might think that the enlightened are imagining their perceptions. Against this speak, however, the attempts with the clairvoyants. The American professor [[w:Gary Schwartz|Gary Schwartz]] tested the most well-known mediums of the United States from 1998 to 2001. '''The mediums could experience the beyond with their spirits and make contact with the dead.''' Gary Schwartz compared their statements about distanced things with a control group of average people. The medium had a ratio of correct answers of 83%, whereas the control group got only 36%. If the mediums know things far away it is very possible, that also their knowing about things in the beyond is correct.

==The Jellyfish Dream==
[[File:Buddha der Liebe.jpg|thumb|200px|Blessing Buddha.]] 
In the year of 2001, a German Yogi saw himself as a jellyfish in a dream. This jellyfish was about to be eaten by a sea spider. The little jellyfish could not escape the spider, as it was stuck between the long legs of the giant spider. '''In the jellyfish’s state of desperation, it called to God.''' God gave the jellyfish the mantra “yes” (in German, &quot;Ja&quot;). The little jellyfish thought of the mantra over and over, and went through death in a state of affirmation, constantly repeating the word “yes”.
 
The black spider killed the jellyfish and '''the little jellyfish continued to think „yes, yes, yes, yes…“ while the Yogi noticed how his consciousness lapsed. His life disappeared. That was a very unpleasant experience, but through the mantra „yes“, he was able to keep his spirit stabile and positive.''' He did not get tense in the course of the death experience, and did not lose positive energy.
 
After his consciousness was extinguished, he moved ahead spiritually. Suddenly, Yogi was there again, and everything was light, peaceful and beautiful. The spider was no where to be seen. '''The Yogi was in a light dimension of the other side, and he felt good.'''
 
After a time, the Yogi woke up from the dream. He lay in bed again and found himself at home, as a person. '''He still felt happy though, and that day he took a long walk through trees and fields where flowers grew, as the sun shone on this beautiful day. The Yogi still had this cosmic consciousness with him from this paradise dream. He felt a large sense of peace, joy, and all-encompassing love for all beings and plants around him.''' He stayed in this state for three days after the dream.
 
Our Yogi saw this dream as a gift. '''In the dream, he learned that one can go through death more easily with a mantra. Those who die repeating a positive mantra can land in paradise after death.''' The knowledge of the death mantra was a saving grace for him. The concept of such is hardly known in the western world. '''Everyone must die one day. It is good to have a mantra at hand for this experience.''' Everyone can choose whichever mantra serves him or her. The mantra “yes” lent power and a sense of relaxation which is useful to go through death. Christians might have a prayer at hand. It is at any rate good to practice this mantra, so that when the time comes, the mantra comes to mind automatically.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===starting a new wikibook===
I'm confused. The section on 'starting a new wikibook' says 'starting a new book is relatively straightforward', and then gives instructions on checking to make sure the name doesnt exist already, but I still dont know how to actually 'start' a new book.  Is there a link somewhere I need to click? [[User:Jcress410|Jcress410]] ([[User talk:Jcress410|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jcress410|contribs]]) 17:33, 6 April 2011 (UTC)

It definitely gave no actual instructions on how to make a new book. Saying the process is straightforward explained nothing. I've tried to clarify the process with an edit, but I'm quite new myself and I'm not sure if my explanation is completely accurate. [[User:Ibidthewriter|Ibidthewriter]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Homogeneous &amp; Homothetic Functions==
For any scalar &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; a function is ''homogenous'' if &lt;math&gt;f(tx_1,tx_2,\dots,tx_n)=t^kf(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n) &lt;/math&gt;
A ''homothetic'' function is a monotonic transformation of a homogeneous function, if there is a monotonic transformation &lt;math&gt;g(z)&lt;/math&gt; and a homogenous function &lt;math&gt;h(x)&lt;/math&gt; such that f can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;g(h)&lt;/math&gt;
* A function is ''monotone'' where &lt;math&gt;\forall \;x,y \in \mathbb{R}^{n} \; x \geq y \rightarrow f(x) \geq f(y)&lt;/math&gt;
* Assumption of homotheticity simplifies computation, 
* Derived functions have homogeneous properties, doubling prices and income doesn't change demand, demand functions are homogenous of degree 0 
* The slope of the MRS is the same along rays through the origin

===Example:===
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Q &amp;= x^{\frac{1}{2}}y^{\frac{1}{2}}+ x^2y^2\\
&amp;\mbox{Q is not homogenous, but represent Q as}\\
&amp;g(f(x,y)), \; f(x,y) = xy \\
g(z) &amp;= z^{\frac{1}{2}}+ z^2\\
g(z) &amp;= (xy)^{\frac{1}{2}} + (xy)^2\\
&amp;\mbox{Calculate MRS,}\\
\frac{\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}}{\frac{\partial Q}{\partial y}} &amp;= \frac{\frac{\partial Q}{\partial z} \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}}{\frac{\partial Q}{\partial z} \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}} = \frac{  \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}}{  \frac{\partial f}{\partial y}}\\
&amp;\mbox{the MRS is a function of the underlying homogenous function}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

A MOS is a four terminal device having source,drain,gate and body. Climbing up another level of abstraction MOS can be seen as a 'voltage controlled current source'. Voltage applied in gate controls the current flowing through source and drain.

      <comment>No explaination on Prime Factors</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This entire article is flawed, especially its attempt to explain prime factors. This course needs to include a full chapter on Factors and Prime Factors rather than this ad-hoc explanation and then lead into this with that in mind. People with poor math aptitude need a direct and concise explanation on on what exactly is a prime factor and the factors behind a number - rather than just include it in a chapter in adding fractions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Eric:  History, previous recalls, this is what happened (these accidents), this is how toyota handled it.

Kristin:  Ethics.  What did toyota know, what didn't they know, how did toyota handle the situation, and how that could be questioned ethically.

Nate: Examples, James Sikes - someone who tried to take advantage of toyota - someone who tryies to abuse the recall situation (maybe toyota is not at fault and it is all people like sikes), David Gilbert, people mistaking gas for brake?


Outline

History of Toyota

- Recall History

- General Safety Record of how their cars are viewed

---They are viewed as safe cars?

-Consumer trust and Toyota

-Discuss past recalls


Timeline of this (2009-2011) Wave of Recalls


Discuss the Ethics called into question.

-Did toyota do something wrong in making this mistake

-Did they intentionally go ahead with a bad design

-Did they delay recalls longer than they should have

-Did toyota properly explain the 3 second emergency shutoff.


Toyota Fined 16.4 Million for Failure to act quick enough


Possible other reasons for Claims against Toyota.

-Did some people make a claim that their accelerator stuck just to get $$ compensation out of toyota for a crash that was user caused?

-Is there ever a bias for people to believe they hit the brakes when really they hit the gas and the accelleration was caused by themselves (can reference NHTSA study i think)


Whistle blowing against toyota:  David Gilbert

-Are his statements fair, or do they unfairly tarnish toyota's reputation?

-Is toyota fair in their consideration of his point of view, or do they immediately try to sweep it under the rug?


Trying to Ride the Craze and gain some Fame:  James Sikes


Case in Point: 1984 Audi 5000

- In this case many Audi cars had runaway acceleration, ultimately proved to be driver error.

-Recall Mgmt.  Should audi have recalled thier cars, since by failure to call back cars they ultimately lost the market share.   similar to cynide and tylenol case - tylenol recalled all pills and began putting safety tops on bottles.


5 Ethical Lessons:
http://business-ethics.com/2010/01/31/2123-toyota-recall-five-critical-lessons/




'''Division of Labor:'''

-explanation of the vehicle problems

-recalls of the &quot;sticking floor mats&quot;

-results, law suits, study results
     * the NHTSA study that showed no correlation of the acceleration to electrical errors

-what actions could have been done to improve the situation faster? 
     * What could toyota have done?  did they do anything wrong?  did the media blow it up?

-what went &quot;wrong&quot;? what procedures were overlooked? how could this have been prevented?

[[Image: Merck_&amp;_Co.svg‎ |200px‎|thumb|right|Merck]]
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merck_%26_Co./ Merck &amp; Co], one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world, launched Vioxx on May 21, 1999 to 47 countries &lt;ref name=&quot;Presley&quot;&gt;Presley, H. (2009). Vioxx and the Merck Team Effort. Retrieved April 15, 2011, from http://www.duke.edu/web/kenanethics/CaseStudies/Vioxx.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Vioxx, generically known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rofecoxib/ rofecoxib], became one of the most widely used pain killers for treating arthritis. Vioxx is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-steroidal_anti-inflammatory_drug/ NSAIDs]), used to reduce pain, inflammation, and stiffness caused by osteoarthritis and certain types of rheumatoid arthritis &lt;ref name=&quot;Cerner&quot;&gt;Cerner Multum, Inc. (2007). VIOXX. Retrieved April 14, 2011, from http://www.drugs.com/vioxx.html&lt;/ref&gt;. It is also used to manage acute pain and dysmenorrhea. Common side effects included upper–respiratory infection, diarrhea, nausea, and high blood pressure &lt;ref name=&quot;Presley&quot; /&gt;.

The NSAIDs, which block both COX-1 ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclooxygenase/ Cyclooxygenase]) and COX-2 enzymes, are the primary drug types for pain relief &lt;ref name=&quot;Cerner&quot; /&gt;. COX-1 maintains the stomach lining and digestive tract, while COX-2 enzyme is mainly associated with pain and inflammation by mediating synthesis of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prostaglandin/ prostaglandins]&lt;ref name=&quot;TCGLAW&quot;&gt;TCGLAW Group.  (2011). COX-1 Drugs Versus COX -2 Drugs. Retrieved April 15, 2011, from http://www.vioxxconsumerguide.com/cox-1-cox-2.html&lt;/ref&gt;. However, Vioxx was a selective NSAIDs, which inhibited only COX-2 enzymes. Since COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes are a checks and balances system, their relationship is inversely proportional.  Serious side effects occur when there is imbalance, such as a heart attack when COX-2 enzyme is suppressed&lt;ref name=&quot;TCGLAW&quot; /&gt;. Although Vioxx showed clinical evidence of its superior gastrointestinal safety, it also caused many serious cardiovascular complications &lt;ref name=&quot;TCGLAW&quot; /&gt;. Possible cardiovascular complications are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_attack/ heart attack] and strokes, blood clots, and kidney failure &lt;ref name=&quot;Cerner&quot; /&gt;.  
	
Following the termination of a long-term Vioxx study called APPROVe (Adenomatous Polyp Prevention on VIOXX), Merck concluded that Vioxx increased the risk of cardiovascular events if taken for 18 months or longer &lt;ref name=&quot;Larsen&quot;&gt;Larsen, A.

Shortly after ending APPROVe, Merck voluntarily withdrew Vioxx from the market on September 30th, 2004 &lt;ref name=&quot;Larsen&quot; /&gt;. The FDA has estimated that the number of death caused by Vioxx-induced cardiovascular events is approximately 28,000 in US and over 150,000 worldwide &lt;ref name=&quot;MSNBC&quot;&gt;Msnbc News.

To adequately examine the underlying ethical issues, this chapter will focus on the FDA and its role in the Vioxx scandal.

==Food and Drug Administration==
[[Image: Freredarme_logo.jpg‎|thumb|left|Food and Drug Administration]]
The [http://www.fda.gov/ Food and Drug Administration] (FDA) is a government agency responsible for protecting the public health by regulating goods, dietary supplements, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, biologics, and blood products in the United States. The FDA is comprised of various offices and center branches under the Office of the Commissioner. Their legal authorities include most of federal laws as part of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Drugs are regulated by the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), which requires different qualifications for three main types of drug products, new drugs, generic drugs, and over-the-counter drugs.  Within the CDER, the Office of New Drugs approves new drugs while the Office of Drug Safety monitors drugs once they are approved.

The FDA failed its obligation to protect the public by exposing consumers to Vioxx and allowing the drug to stay on the market from 2000 – 2004.   Although [http://www.merck.com/ Merck] was intentionally misrepresenting data, the FDA had multiple opportunities to recall Vioxx.   At each major event throughout Vioxx’s timeline, the FDA's primary concern was protecting itself (and sometimes Merck) while disregarding the safety of the consumers.  

===Vioxx Gastrointestinal Outcome studies (VIGOR) – June 29, 2000=== 
	This studied confirmed that Vioxx reduced the number of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal gastrointestinal] (GI) complications; however, according to the FDA, it was the first study that showed an increase in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular cardiovascular] (CV) complications&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA&quot;&gt;Food and Drug Administration (n.d.). Sequence of Events with Vioxx, since opening of IND. Retrieved April 15, 2011, from http://www.fda.gov/ohrms/dockets/ac/05/briefing/2005-4090B1_04_E-FDA-TAB-C.htm &lt;/ref&gt;.  On February 8, 2001 (8 months later), the FDA’s Arthritis Advisory Committee met to discuss the findings of VIGOR.  This committee concluded that Vioxx labeling must include the results of this study.  The committee “recommended to include balanced information regarding safety results of Vioxx and de-emphasize the GI safety advantage in [the] Vioxx label”&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA&quot; /&gt;.  Merck was unwilling to de-emphasize the GI advantages and it was not until April 11, 2002 (nearly 22 months after VIGOR) that the labeling was changed to include information of clinical studies, precautions, drug interaction, and dosage and administration sections&lt;ref name=&quot;Kweder&quot;&gt;Kweder, S. (2004, November 18). Vioxx and Drug Safety. Retrieved April 14, 2011, from http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Testimony/ucm113235.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.   The label first presented the positive GI safety of the drug then the negative CV risks. 

In addition the FDA’s inability to implement and enforce Vioxx label changes in a timely manner, Merck severely misled the public by issuing a press release titled, “Merck Confirms Favorable Cardiovascular Safety Profile of Vioxx,” on May 22, 2001, almost a year after VIGOR.  This press release stated that, “Clinical trials with Vioxx…have shown no difference in the incidence of cardiovascular events,” &lt;ref name=&quot;Merck&quot;&gt;Merck. (2001, May 22). Merck Confirms Favorable Cardiovascular Safety Profile of Vioxx [Press release]. Retrieved April 14, 2011, from http://dida.library.ucsf.edu/pdf/oxx17k10&lt;/ref&gt;.  This statement directly contradicts the results of VIGOR.  

===Kaiser Permanente Study – August 11, 2004 === 
After the VIGOR results were submitted to the FDA, they began their own investigation, in August 2001 and ended in 2004, regarding CV safety while using Vioxx.  This investigation was collaborative with [https://www.kaiserpermanente.org/ Kaiser Permanent] and was led by FDA’s Dr. David Graham, named the Office of Drug Safety (ODS) project officer&lt;ref name=&quot;Kweder&quot; /&gt;.  On August 11, 2004, Graham emailed his supervisor at ODS and reported the following, “We concluded that high-dose Vioxx significantly increased the risk of heart attacks and sudden death and that the high doses of the drug should not be prescribed or used by patients. This is exactly the finding of VIGOR: high dose increases the risk of heart attack” &lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly&quot;&gt;Kelly, J. (2004, November 23). Harsh criticism lobbed at FDA in Senate Vioxx hearing. Retrieved April 15, 2011, from http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/538021&lt;/ref&gt;.  Graham stated that after he provided his findings to the FDA, “[it] triggered an explosive response from the Office of New Drugs, which approved Vioxx in the first place and was responsible for regulating it postmarketing.  One drug safety manager… noted that Merck needed to know our study results. I guess that Merck needed to know the results, but the public didn't” &lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly&quot; /&gt;.  Graham had also expressed interest in submitting the findings to many prominent scientific journals; however, his management immediately denied the request.

Although Graham had not received permission, he submitted an abstract to the Lancet.  Acting FDA Commissioner, Dr. Lester Crawford issued a statement that Graham’s findings had not gone, “through the long-established peer review and clearance,” which prompted the FDA to, “[contact] the journal's editor, out of respect for the scientific peer-review process” &lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly&quot; /&gt;.  However, it was clear that the FDA was only trying to cover its tracks.  After careful investigation by Tom Devine, legal director of the [http://www.whistleblower.org/ Government Accountability Project], he found that, “the FDA flunked every test of credibility while Graham passed all of them” &lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly&quot; /&gt;.  Instead, Devine believed the FDA was employing a “smokescreen syndrome” to divert focus to the messenger and away from the message.  

===Adenomatous Polyp PRevention On Vioxx (APPROVe) – September 27, 2004===
This study was a long term investigation to evaluate the effectiveness of Vioxx for treating colon polyps.  However, on September 27, 2004, this study was immediately stopped when data indicated a significant increase in the amount of CV events&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA&quot; /&gt;.  On September 28, 2004, Merck held a meeting with senior management of FDA to discuss these results and “announced the product withdrawal of Vioxx from the market”&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA&quot; /&gt;.  Two days later, on September 30, 2004, this withdrawal was publicly announced&lt;ref name=&quot;FDA&quot; /&gt;.

===FDA Presents Initiatives to Strengthen Drug Safety – November 18, 2004===
On November 18, 2004, Dr. Sandra Kweder issued a statement before the Senate Committee on Finance summarizing the Vioxx incident&lt;ref name=&quot;Kweder&quot; /&gt;.  At the end, Kweder offered a five step plan that was to be implemented. First, the CDER would fund a study to evaluate the FDA’s drug safety system by the Institute of Medicine (IOM).  Second, the FDA would implement a program that allows individuals’ professional opinions to be heard. Third, a Director of the Office of Drug Safety, a position that was currently unoccupied, would be appointed by the FDA.  Fourth, the FDA would hold seminars to discuss “drug safety and risk management issues”.  Lastly, the FDA would, “publish final versions of three guidances that the agency developed to help pharmaceutical firms manage risks involving drugs and biological products”&lt;ref name=&quot;Kweder&quot; /&gt;.

==Conclusion==
Many point to the Vioxx Scandal as proof that the FDA is currently an under-regulated industry, but such haphazard conclusions should not be reached so hastily. This would likely be an instance of confirmation bias without further evidence. There are arguments of under-regulation and over-regulation within the FDA. It is important to note that the prescription drug companies often favor over-regulation due to the distinct economic advantages. &lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Milton &amp; Rose (1979). ''Free to Choose''. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. ISBN 0-15-133481-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Under-Regulation===

Both Vioxx and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troglitazone/ Rezulin] are high profile cases of drugs that the FDA have approved but later withdrawn due to substantial health risks. The public champions cases such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frances_Oldham_Kelsey Frances Oldham Kelsey] who refused the authorization of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide thalidomide] which turned out to be a strong [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teratology#Teratogenesis teratogenic substance] that caused babies to be born limbless. Many point to the thalidomide incident to the modern day approval of Vioxx as a change in the culture of the FDA that needs to be better-regulated.

The FDA is strongly influenced by pharmaceutical industries. In 2005, 70% of FDA panels writing clinical guidelines contained at least one member on the panel who had financial links to the drug companies whose drugs were being covered by those guidelines. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carpenter D. et al. |title=Approval times for new drugs: does the source of funding for FDA staff matter?
|journal=Health Affairs (Millwood) |year=2003 |volume=Suppl Web Exclusives:W3 |pages=618–24 |pmid=15506165}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA passed a policy on March 21, 2007 that prohibited experts from serving on the advisory committees if they are financially linked to a company whose product is being questioned.

===Over-Regulation===

On the other-hand, over-regulation can also hurt not only drug companies, but also consumers. The drug-approval process can delay the time between the drugs development and the time it reaches the market. This delay could prevent many life-saving drugs from entering the market in time to save lives. These harms of over-regulation often go unobserved because a wrongful ban or an over-extended delay in a drug approval maintains the status-quo to the public eye. These harms of over-regulation are further magnified when they are not properly weighed against highly publicized scandals such as Vioxx. These delays also force people to seek drugs elsewhere such as through the black market or in other countries, which introduces many other risks.

Over-regulation can also increase the price of drugs. High levels of regulation increases the cost of the development of the drug, which would raise prices. Long delays in drug-approval also lower competition within the drugs available to consumers, leading to an increase in price. In 2011, the drug [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makena Makena] increased their price from about $10 to $1,500 after the FDA began regulating its market. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1364747/Preemie-outrage-Cost-makena-drug-prevents-premature-birth-rise-10-1500-KV-Pharmaceuticals.html |author=[[Daily Mail]] |title=Preemie outrage: Cost of drug that prevents premature birth to rise from $10 to $1500.|date=March 9, 2011 |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After public outcry and complaints, the FDA lowered certain regulations within the market and the price of Makena was reduced. This is clearly an instance where over-regulation benefits drug companies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Economics deals with the fundamental questions of why people produce, what they produce, and how much they produce. While one economy may depend on rice, another may need wheat to sustain its economy. Since goods do not stay in the possession of one person but are constantly created and consumed, the system by which goods move is very important to all consumers. There are two extremes of economic systems: ''Planned Economies'' and ''Market Economies''. Although a topic in macroeconomics, a quick overview of these two terms is helpful in understanding the bigger picture behind microeconomics.

==Planned Economies==
A pure planned economy has one person or group who controls what is produced; all businesses work together to produce goods and services that are planned and distributed by the government. These economies are also called ''Command Economies'' because everyone must follow specific guidelines set up by the government. The reason behind such an economy is to make sure that everything needed is produced and that everyone's needs are fulfilled. The main drawback of planned economies is that those who plan the economy must know exactly what should be produced and in what quantities; otherwise, people will not be able to buy as much as they need and shortages will occur.

Planned economies have several advantages. Ideally, there is no unemployment, and needs never go unfulfilled; because the government knows how much food, medicine, and other goods is needed, it can produce enough for all. Realistically, however, these systems tend to suffer from large inefficiencies and are overall not as successful as other types of economic systems.

==Market Economies==
A pure market economy is one perfectly free of external control. Individuals are left up to themselves to decide what to produce, who to work for, and how to get the things they need. This type of economy, though it may be chaotic at times, allows people to change along with the shifting market conditions to maximize their profits.

Although avoiding many of the inadequacies of planned economies, market economies are not free of their own problems and downfalls. Perhaps the greatest problem is that business firms may refuse to produce goods that unprofitable for them. For instance, in 2000 there was a shortage of tetanus vaccine in the United States; one of the two companies that had previously made it went bankrupt. Because it was expensive to make, other companies were unwilling to start production themselves, leaving only one firm struggling to keep up with demand. In a planned economy, this shortage would not happen because the government would boost production of the vaccine if it were needed.

Because there is no regulation ensuring equality and fairness, market economies are burdened with unemployment, and even those with jobs can never be certain that they will make enough to provide for all of their needs. Despite these and other problems, market economies come with many advantages, chief among which is speed. Because they do not need to wait for word from the government before changing their output, companies under market economies can quickly keep up with fluctuations in the economy, tending to be more efficient than regulated markets. Also, individuals have more freedom and opportunities to do the jobs they want and to profit by them.

==Mixed Economies==
Most modern economies do not strictly follow either system but, wanting the benefits from both systems, will instead have some combination of the two. Usually they have a mostly free market, with the government owning some businesses and providing some goods and services to the citizens. Some governments may ''subsidize'' industries, rather than actually own them. When a government subsidizes an industry, it provides benefits, such as tax breaks, so that the industry will remain profitable. Similarly, mixed governments may have government-owned hospitals and medical services for public use but allow other parts of the economy to run on their own to avoid inefficiency.

==Markets==
In any economy that is not completely planned, there are markets for some, or all, goods and services. These markets are where everything we study in microeconomics occurs. In a pure free-market economy, all goods and services may be bought and sold, whereas in some mixed economies, certain goods are regulated by the government. In either case, the way a good is bought and sold depends on how scarce it is, who supplies it, and what the consumer wants to do with it. In the next chapter, we will start to examine the way markets work. 

==Review==
# Identify one or more countries which demonstrate each of the three main economic types: planned, market, and mixed. 
# Why are most modern economies mixed?
# What type of goods would a country not want to have a market for? Why?

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Properties of Production Sets===

The production vector &lt;math&gt; Y = (y_1,y_2,\ldots y_n) &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;y_i &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt; represents an output, and &lt;math&gt;y_i &lt; 0&lt;/math&gt; an input

* Y is non empty
* Y is closed (includes its boundary)
* No free lunch - &lt;math&gt;y\geq 0 \rightarrow Y=0&lt;/math&gt; (no inputs, no outputs)
* possibility of inaction &lt;math&gt;(0\in Y)&lt;/math&gt;
* Free disposal
* Irreversability - can't make output into inputs
* Returns to scale:
**Non-increasing: &lt;math&gt;\forall y \in Y, \, \alpha y \in Y \forall \alpha \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;
**Non-decreasing: &lt;math&gt;\forall y \in Y, \, \alpha y \in Y \forall \alpha &gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;
**Constant: &lt;math&gt;\forall y \in Y, \, \alpha y \in Y \forall \alpha \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;
* Additivity: &lt;math&gt; y \in Y \mbox{ and } {y}^{\prime} \in Y \rightarrow y+{y}^{\prime} \in Y&lt;/math&gt;
* Convexity: &lt;math&gt;y,{y}^{\prime} \in Y \mbox{ and } a\in[0,1] \rightarrow ay+(1-a){y}^{\prime}\in Y &lt;/math&gt;

===Profit maximization===

====Example:====
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
\max&amp;\;p_2y_2 - p_1y_1 \\
\mbox{s.t. } &amp;[y_1,y_2] \in Y \\
&amp;f(y_1,y_2) \leq k \\
\mathcal{L}(y_1,y_2,\lambda) &amp;= p_2y_2-p_1y_1 + \lambda [k-f(y_1,y_2)]\\
\mathcal{L}_1 &amp;= -p_1 -\lambda  f_1 = 0\\
\mathcal{L}_2 &amp;=  p_1 -\lambda  f_2 = 0\\
\mathcal{L}_\lambda &amp;=  k -f(y_1,y_2) = 0\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
=====Single Output:=====
&lt;math&gt;y=f(Z)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;Z=(z_1,z_2,\ldots,z_n)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
&amp;\max_{y,Z} py - w \\ \mbox{subject to } &amp;y=f(z)\\ 
&amp;\mbox{ -or- }\\
&amp;\max_{Z} pf(Z) - wZ \\ 
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial z_i} &amp;= pf_i - w_i \leq 0\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
===marginal revenue product===
Marginal revenue product is the price of output times the marginal product of input 
&lt;math&gt;MRP =p\cdot f_i&lt;/math&gt; 
&lt;br&gt;
The first order conditions for profit maximization require the marginal revenue product to equal input cost for all inputs (actually) used in production, &lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt; pf_i = w_i \;\forall z_i &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;

===marginal rate of techical substitution===
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
pf_1 &amp;= w_1 \\
pf_2 &amp;= w_2 \\
&amp;\rightarrow \frac{f_1}{f_2} = \frac{w_1}{w_2}
f(z_1,z_2) &amp;= \bar{y}\\
f_1dz_1 &amp;+ f_2dz_2 = 0\\
\frac{dz_2}{dz_1} &amp;= -\frac{f_1}{f_2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Properties of profit functions and supply===
* Profit functions exhibit homogeneity of degree 1 &lt;math&gt;\pi=pf(z)-w {z}&lt;/math&gt; doubling all prices doubles nominal profit
* supply functions exhibit homogeneity of degree 0

==Cost Minimization==
The optimal CMP gives cost function &lt;align&gt;\funcd{c}{w,q}&lt;/align&gt;
===Example===
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\min_{z_1,z_2} &amp;\,w_1z_1+w_2z_2 \mbox{ s.t. } f(z_1,z_2) \leq q\\
\mathcal{L}(z_1,z_2,\lambda) &amp;= w_1z_1+w_2z_2 - \lambda [f(z_1,z_2) - q]\\
\mathcal{L}_1 &amp;= w_1-\lambda f_1 = 0 \\
\mathcal{L}_2 &amp;= w_2-\lambda f_2 = 0 \\
\mathcal{L}_\lambda &amp;= f(z_1,z_2) - q=0\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\frac{w_1}{w_2} = \frac{f_1}{f_2} \; \frac{mp_1}{mp_2}
&lt;/math&gt;
The ratio of input prices equals the ratio of  marginal products

&lt;math&gt;\frac{w_1}{f_1}=\frac{w_2}{f_2}&lt;/math&gt;
The marginal cost of expansion through $z_1$ equals the marginal cost of expansion through &lt;math&gt;z_2&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{C}(w_1,w_2,q)&amp;=w_1z_1^*+w_2z_2^*\\
&amp;=w_1z_1^*+w_2z_2^* -\lambda [f(z_1^*,z_2^*)-q]\\
\frac{\partial C}{\partial w_1} &amp;= z_1^*\\
\frac{\partial C}{\partial w_2} &amp;= z_2^*\\
\frac{\partial C}{\partial q} &amp;= \lambda \mbox{- marginal cost}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The solution to the CMP gives factor demands, &lt;math&gt; z_i^* = z_i({w},q)&lt;/math&gt; and the cost function &lt;math&gt;\sum w_iz_i = c(w,q)&lt;/math&gt;

==Cost Functions==
* &lt;math&gt;P&gt;ATC&lt;/math&gt; gives positive economic profit, short run and long run
* In short run, fixed costs are irrelevant. Shut down if &lt;math&gt;p&lt;AVC&lt;/math&gt;
* minimum efficient scale: &lt;math&gt;mc=ATC=P&lt;/math&gt;

No economic profits in the long run, given free entry for any &lt;math&gt;P&gt;ATC&lt;/math&gt; firms enter, in the long run &lt;math&gt;\pi\to 0&lt;/math&gt; until &lt;math&gt;p=ATC\rightarrow \pi=0&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Thanks for your recent edit on the Calculus/Functions page.  It's always good to have more people helping with the book.  I don't mean to discourage you, but I undid the revision you made to that page.  Although your revision is more concise than the old one, there is a loss of some important information such as the discussion about independent and dependent variables.  Feel free to re-work your revision to include the missing material.  Again, thanks for contributing to the project!

      <text xml:space="preserve">===== Classification of receivables =====
Receivables can be classified as accounts receivables or trade debtors, bills receivable and other receivables ( loans, settlement amounts due for non-current asset sales, rent receivable, term deposits). Other receivables can be divided according to whether they are expected to be received within the current accounting period or 12 months (current receivables), or received greater than 12 months ( non-current receivables).

===== Accounts receivables =====
Not all accounts receivables will be paid, and an allowance has to be made for bad debts. The allowance for bad debts can
be calculated either as '''percentage of net credit sales''' or by '''ageing method of estimating bad debts'''.
These are determined by historical accounting information 

====== Allowance methods of accrual accounting for bad debts ======
e.g.'' percentage of net credit sales'' : two years ago of $1000 net credit sales, $50 was uncollectable,
and last year net credit sales was $2000 , and an allowance of 5% was made for bad debts , so the bad debts allowance for this period
is $100.

e.g.  ''ageing of accounts receivables'' : overdue accounts receivable was divided into periods of 0-30 days, 30-60 days, 60-90 days, 90-180 days,
and the amounts that were never paid that were due in each period was divided by the amounts that were eventually collected for each period, giving a predictably increasing percentage of bad debts , the longer the amounts were overdue e.g. 2% at 0-30 days, 4% at 30-60 days, 20% at 60-90 days, 40% at 90-180 days.

The allowance for bad debts is an estimate of how much of a period's reported accounts receivables will eventually be not collectible, and is an attempt to predict
that a bad debt has occurred , which of course , is only known for sure when the bad debt has to be written off, which will occur a long time after the credit sale is
made. 

Hence, at the end of a reporting period, when reporting the accounts receivables , a bad debts expense is reported for that same period, which is equal
to the allowance that is made with either of the 2 methods  The account , ''allowance for bad debts'', is then '''a contra-asset account''' vs. accounts receivables asset account, and is hence increases with a contra to a debit ( for asset accounts), so is increased by a credit. Hence the recording should be , 

:bad debts expense - debit

:allowance for bad debts - credit  ( the custom is to show debit lines above credit lines).

====== Writing off a bad debt determined to be unrecoverable in allowance methods for accounts receivables bad debt ======
When the bad debt is determined in the future to be bad, an amount in the accounts receivable needs to be reduced (credited), and
hence the transaction is

:allowance for bad debts - debit

:accounts receivable - credit
====== tracing of gst transactions in allowance method for writing off bad debts from the initial credit sale ======
'''GST''' , if applicable,  according to the accrual principle, is collected at the time of a credit sale, so when the accounts receivable is debited to record the credit to sales account, it is also debited to record the GST cash receivable, and GST liability account is credited, at the time of the sale. 
# A/R  - debit = sale amount + GST amount
# Sales - credit sale amount
# GST (Collections/Liability) - credit GST amount
 
In a good debtor situation, on the debtor paying, 
# the cash in bank account is debited for the sale amount + gst amount, and 
# the accounts receivable is credited for the equivalent total amount.
GST can be regarded as an accrual item, and not a cash item, and is related to the sale action, not the cash collection. 

In a bad debtor situation, when '''a bad debt is written off''', it is certain the GST that was owing can't be collected either, so the transaction is :-
# to debit the allowance for bad debts for the sale amount,
# debit the GST liability account for the GST amount, and 
# credit the account receivable for the sum of sale+GST, 

to acknowledge the receivable can't be collected.

====== other differences between percentage of net sales allowance method, and ageing of accounts receivables allowance method ======
GST also highlights a difference between the net credit sales allowance method, and &lt;u&gt;the ageing of accounts receivable allowance&lt;/u&gt; methods : in the latter, an overall weighted amount of the accounts receivables is calculated as the estimate of bad debts, but &lt;u&gt;the allowance made should be less the GST&lt;/u&gt; that was collectible from the bad debt amount as well.

A more obvious difference between the two methods, is that the allowance of percentage of net credit sales does not take into account residual amounts in the bad debts allowance account, whereas the residual in the allowance account in the ageing of accounts receivables is regarded as part of the current ageing estimate for the bad debts :
so in &lt;u&gt;the percentage of net credit sales method&lt;/u&gt;, the allowance account ''increases'' by the allowance calculated for the current net credit sales, but in &lt;u&gt;the ageing of accounts receivables method&lt;/u&gt; , the allowance is made ''equal'' to current ageing allowance calculated. Therefore, the bad debts expense recorded at end of period for the ageing of AR method will be the difference of the allowance calculated and the residual balance of the allowance for bad debts account.

====== Recovery of bad debts previously written off ======
This reverses the bad debt written off almost, so needs to account for gst recollected, accounts receivable previously written off, as well as cash. The amount is not
recorded back in the bad debts allowance account though, it is recorded in a separate bad debts recovered account.
The original transaction for writing off was   
# DR - Allowance for Bad Debts
# DR - GST
# CR - A/R,  

so the reversal is is
# DR - A/R, 
# CR - Bad Debts Recovered, 
# CR - GST

(In the above, sum of DR equals sum of CR).
Bad Debts Recovered increases with Credits, so isn't an asset, and it isn't a liability, so it is actually an equity (income) account. The Allowance for Bad Debts account is not re-credited because this allows tracking of recoverable bad debts that were previously written off.

To record the cash recovered, a second entry is then
# DR -Cash in Bank
# CR - A/R

Recording the equivalent DR to A/R and Cr to A/R in the separate transactions may not be necessary, but it seems clearer.

===== Management indices for receivables =====
# '''Receivables turnover ratio''' is net credit sales / average receivables.
&lt;sub&gt; average monthly receivable, or average quarterly, or mean of starting / ending receivable&lt;/sub&gt;
# '''Average Collection period''' is 365 / receivables turnover.

These ratios are useful in comparing the efficiency of debt recovery for this company , and for comparison with other
companies of similar turnover. 


===== ethical issues with receivables =====
Money can be made illicitly by employees by issuing false discounts, false sales returns, writing off false bad debts, omitting cash received, issuing higher than actual accounts owing statements to customers, so it advisable to have at least one person for accounts receivable bookkeeping,  one person for cash receipt recording, one person for accounts owing issuing to customers. Collusion could be a problem. Examples of ethical problems , where intention is not to steal money but to assist marketing , include to overstate turnover, such as in the recent (2010)  IT outsourcing industry scandal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Menelaus' theorem''' is due to the Greek philosopher Menelaus of Alexandria.

[Add diagram]

Let ABC be any triangle.  Let a straight line cross BC at D, AC at E and AB at F (extending one side as necessary).  Then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \frac{BD}{DC}\frac{CE}{EA}\frac{AF}{FB} = -1&lt;/math&gt;.

The product is negative because one side has to be produced and so one of the segments must be treated as of negative length.

Conversely, if three points on the three sides of a triangle satisfy the above relationship, they must be collinear.

      <comment>/* Setting the material shader properties */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The mater command is used to set the material properties for a previously defined [[/region/]]. This includes parameters, such as the material [[/shader/]], the [[/shader properties/]], the [[/rgb/]] colour values and any [[/inheritance/]] properties of the materials.

 # Set the material properties for region1.r to plastic
 mater region1.r plastic

=== Setting the material shader properties ===

The [[/shader properties/]] that can be configured depends on the type of material [[/shader/]] being utilized. The following example shows how to set the [[/transparency/]], [[/reflectiveness/]], and [[/shininess/]] properties for a [[/plastic/]] material.

 mater region1.r plastic &quot;plastic tr=0.3 di=1.0 re=0.2&quot; 255 0 0 0

Note that the [[/shader/]] and [[/shader properties/]] are passed as a single parameter enclosed in [[/quotation marks/]]. The [[/quotation marks/]] are necessary for grouping parameters separated by spaces.

      <comment>/* To install Postgresql on Ubuntu10.10 do the following: */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Installing OC 3.0.4.1 on UBUNTU 10.10 Server ==

This document describes process of installing OpenClinica version 3.0.4.1 on the Linux UBUNTU Server version 10.10

=== Installing required software ===

==== PostgreSQL database ====
===== To install Postgresql on Ubuntu10.10 do the following: =====
*	apt-get update
*	apt-get install postgresql-8.4
*	default TCP port for PostgreSQL: 5432
*	configuration files (for version 8.4): /etc/postgresql/*
*	cluster data (for version 8.4): /var/lib/postgresql/{version}/{cluster}/*
*	set up password for PostgreSQL account: postgres
**	su postgres
**	psql postgres
**	ALTER ROLE postgres WITH ENCRYPTED Password “yoursecretpassword”;
**	Login into PostgreSql database using new password: psql –hlocalhost –U postgres –W

===== If you want to setup Remote access for PostgreSql: =====
*	Modify /etc/postgresql/{version}/{cluster}/postgresql.conf:&lt;br&gt;
listen_address = “IP_address, localhost” and save
*	Modify /etc/postgresql/{version}/{cluster}/pg_hba.conf:&lt;br&gt;
	Add following line: host	ALL	ALL	IP/mask	md5
*	Restart PostgreSQL: service postgresql restart or /etc/init.d/postgresql restart
*	If you have firewall open port TCP 5432

===== If you want to check if postgresql is running: =====
*	netstat –ant | grep 5432
*	ps –aux | grep postgres
*	psql --version
*	chkconfig --list | grep postgresql

==== Apache Tomcat 6 and JDK 6 ====

To install Tomcat 6 and JDK 6:
*	apt-get update
*	apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk tomcat6 tomcat6-admin tomcat6-common tomcat6-docs tomcat6-examples
*	Apache Tomcat 6 configuration files: /etc/tomcat6
*	CATALINA_BASE and CATALINA_HOME = /var/lib/tomcat6
*	TCP default port: 8080
*	http://ip_address:8080
*	JDK6:
**	JAVA_HOME: /usr/lib/jvm/
**	java –version // to check current version of JVM

At this stage we should have all required application installed on the system required for OpenClinica.

==== OpenClinica ====

OpenClincia application requires access to directory where e.g.CRFs, data extract sets etc will be stored once application is running. You can create this anywhere on your server as long as it is accessible by tomcat6 user (in this document by you may wish to create different user to run tomcat server). I e.g. have under /var/OpenClinica/ all the folders used by all the instances of OpenClinica installed on my server (it will make easier as well to do backup of your OpenClinica data).&lt;br&gt; 


General steps required to set up OpenClinica web application, data folder and PostgreSQL database:&lt;br&gt;
# Please download version of OpenClinica you would like to install unzip and read installation notes (recommended).
# Create role, database on PostgreSQL database used by OpenClinica installation (appropriate scrips are included in the file you download from OpenClinica web site).
# Prepare data folder for OpenClinca and make sure that tomcat6 user can read and write to this location; You may create under: /var/OpenClinica/{OC_instancename}/ two folders:
## One with data for OpenClinica
## Second with logs for OpenClinica instance
# Deploy OpenClinica.war (by changing the name of the war file you can deploy more than one instance of OpenClinica on your Apache Tomcat 6 server)
# Either follow the instruction how to deploy war file on the Apache Tomcat 6 server or use Tomcat WE Application Manager
# Allow up to 1 minutes to deploy your new installation on the Apache Tomcat 6 server (it depends of course how much memory, and CPU has your server, check if java is doing by issuing top command):
# You should have under tomcat6 “webapps” folder with the OpenClinica instance
# Stop tomcat 6 server: service tomcat6 stop
# Edit file for your instance /var/lib/tomcat6/webapps/{OC_instanceName}/WEB-INF/classes/datainfo.properties
## You have to provide path to the OpenClinica data folder for this instance
## Username, password and database for PostgreSQL server
# Start tomcat6: service tomcat6 start

Depending on CPU and memory this step may take up to few minutes to finish (you may monitor activity of java process using top command tool)
If everything went fine you should be able to access your instance: http://IP_tomcat6_server:8080/OpenClinica_instancename

=== Enable SSL support on Apache Tomcat 6 ===

See: http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-6.0-doc/ssl-howto.html

We will use SSL using APR (SSL self-signed server certificate and private key):
*	Install additional packages:
*	apt-get update
*	We install native library and APR libraries
*	apt-get install libtcnative-1 libapr1 libaprutil1
*	Edit tomcat 6 configuration file: /etc/tomcat6/server.xml
*	Enable APR listener
*	Enable SSL over APR:
*	Specify parameter for SSL connection
*	Path to the SSL server certificate
*	Path to the SSL server private key
*	Restart tomcat6 server: service tomca6 restart
*	netstat –ant | grep 8443 //check if sever is listening on the default 8443 TCP port for tomcat 6 for SSL connection
	
=== Backup /Restore of OpenClinica ===
==== Backup ====
*	we have to backup the OpenClinica instance files
*	Apache Tomcat 6 configuration files
*	PostgreSql configuration files
*	Data folder for OpenClinica instance
*	Database for OpenClinica

==== Restore ====
*	Not done yet

== Shader types ==

There are three types of shaders available from within mged:

* Paint shaders
* Plastic shaders
* Light shaders

=== Paint shaders ===

Paint shaders apply pigment and texture to object surfaces.

* [[/bwtexture/]] -- black and white texture maps.
* [[/camo/]] -- camouflage shader.
* [[/checker/]] -- checkerboard shader.
* [[/cloud/]] -- Geoffrey Gardner 2d style cloud texture map.
* [[/fakestar/]] -- fake star pattern.
* [[/texture/]] -- full colour texture mapping.

=== Plastic shaders ===

The three plastic shaders are:

* [[/mirror/]] -- mirror surface.
* [[/glass/]] -- simulated grass.
* [[/plastic/]] -- simulated plastic.

=== Light shader ===

The light shader provides a complex facility for producing image illumination.

* [[/fbmcolor/]] -- fractional brownian motion noise applied to colour.
* [[/fire/]] -- simulated flames.
* [[/glass/]] -- simulated grass.
* [[/gravel/]] -- gravel noiset applied to color and normal.
* [[/light/]] -- light source.
* [[/marble/]] -- marble texture.
* [[/mirror/]] -- mirror surface.
* [[/plastic/]] -- simulated plastic.

== Define $wgCollectionHierarchyDelimiter = &quot;/&quot; for Wikibooks project(s) ==

I would like to propose that the definition of &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;$wgCollectionHierarchyDelimiter = &quot;/&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, so that when creating a collection (e.g. from the category of a book that already exists but that does not have a collection), the extension save the page with the following syntax in the collection pages:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;:[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;Book name/Chapter name'''|Chapter name'''&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
instead of the standard syntax, which is
 &lt;nowiki&gt;:[[Book name/Chapter name]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
With this change, the title of each page will be correctly displayed without the prefix &quot;Book name/&quot; (and therefore it won't be necessary to correct the collection page right after creating it from [[Special:Book]]). This configuration is available since [[rev:73454]] of the extension and I think it should be enabled by default on all Wikibooks projects, since most projects use the &quot;/&quot; as delimiter. See also [[mw:Special:Code/MediaWiki/73454#c12899|these comments]].

What do you think? [[:pt:User:Helder.wiki|Helder]] 23:58, 14 March 2011 (UTC)
:I like it.  I think most of the time that's what someone would want, and in the few cases where it's ''not'' what is wanted, it can be fixed manually.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 12:28, 15 March 2011 (UTC)

::Collections are the basis for auto-generating a PDF.  The PDF may include several pages (or... a &quot;collection&quot; of pages).  The PDF can be turned into a dead-tree version of a book. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 13:43, 15 March 2011 (UTC)
::: Where, then, do &quot;.../Print version&quot; pages fit into this?  If the entire contents of the book are on a single page, already in the correct order, would one use a collection of that one page?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 11:33, 16 March 2011 (UTC)
::::My opinion is that collections supersede print versions.  Often print versions of books run into the transclusion limit and so don't actually contain the full book.  Collections have no such limit.  Additionally, updating a collection is far easier as you don't have to wait for all the pages to be rendered in your browser before you update the list of pages that are included.  The PDF generated can be printed, saved, or ordered as a physical book.  There is no messing with {{tag|noinclude}} either as you can add templates to [[:Category:Exclude in print]] (category name could be changed in settings) or use {{tl|hide in print}}/{{tl|only in print}} for anything else.  It is a far superior solution both technically and for ease of use, with more flexibility.  &quot;Print versions&quot; are a hack in comparison. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:45, 16 March 2011 (UTC)
::::I think print versions of a book are a relic from a time when people generated PDFs on their own infrequently and could easily become dated compared to the live version. I guess you could use a book's print version as a single page collection. I think more people would find updating a collection with new pages or changes in the order using the collection interface easier though. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:58, 16 March 2011 (UTC)

:::::: Interesting.  A particularly likely use I've had in mind for my [[Template:Navlist|Navlist]] suite is to automatically generate Print version pages: just as the navlist automatically figures out what links to put on navigation boxes at the tops and bottoms of pages, it should be easy to generate translusions of all the pages of the book in order, with the navigation boxes simply automatically suppressing themselves (doesn't involve noinclude's).

:::::: What are the translusion limits that print versions come up against?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 17:40, 16 March 2011 (UTC)

::::::: Translusion invokes template expansion. I think each template subtracts from a time limit, so if one template eats whatever time remains, than the rest of the templates won't be expanded. I believe some operations are considered more expensive and subtract from the time faster as well. I suggest not relying too much on limits or trying to work around them though as they can change at any time as the parser is changed and improved on. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:18, 16 March 2011 (UTC)

:::::::Wikipedia has a page about the limits: [[w:Wikipedia:Template limits]]. The most problematic one for print versions (mainly the automatic version) is the [[:Category:Pages where template include size is exceeded]]. It makes (almost?) [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/pt/w/index.php/?diff=prev&amp;oldid=214122 impossible] to get an automatic print version for long books.
:::::::Ideally, Collection extension [[mw:Extension:Collection/Wishlist#Output_HTML|should have the option to output HTML]] too (or the feature could be added to [[mw:Extension:BookManager]]), so that editors don't need to keep various &quot;lists of chapters of a book&quot; syncronized (table of contents, print version, collection, navigation...).

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book is for a course on International Service Learning at Western Washington University Spring 2011. 

The initial outline is :

1.	Introduction: Begin this section with an introduction in which you:
o	Develop your own definition of ethical global citizenship and service learning. 
o	Discuss the kind of relationships a student might want to build with partners abroad, keeping in mind our conversation about helping, service, fixing, etc. 
o	Think about how an individual student represents more than just him/herself, and how a single trip has repercussions beyond just that trip, if we are trying to build long-term, sustainable partnerships in other countries. 
o	Consider advising a travel group to develop their own ethical travel guidelines. Give an idea of what sort of guidelines they might consider.
2.	Respect – (start with an introduction):
o	Traveling with a group
o	Cultural norms
o	Appropriate Dress
o	Alcohol and Drugs
o	The Camera 
o	Displays of materialism and “wealth”
3.	Relationships – (start with an introduction):
o	Developing relationships
o	Power and equity
o	Confidentiality
o	Sustaining relationships when you leave
4.	Service – (start with an introduction):
o	Helping vs. Service 
o	Who is it for? 
o	Short term vs. long term
o	Giving and Receiving
5.	Resources – (start with an introduction):
o	Eco-systems
o	Carbon footprint
6.	Identity shifts – (start with an introduction):: (Ways that you are culturally different with regard to religion, sexuality, values and norms – how will that play itself out in another context? What might you want to think about before you go?)
o	Gender/Sexual Orientation
o	Race
o	Religion
o	Culture Shock
o	Homesickness
o	Boredom

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Cramer's Rule===
For a three by three system:

&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c}
ax+by+cz=j\\
dx+ey+fz=k\\
gx+hy+iz=l\\
\end{array} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In matrix form: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
a&amp;b&amp;c\\d&amp;e&amp;f\\g&amp;h&amp;i
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x\\y\\z
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
j\\k\\l
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{\begin{vmatrix}j&amp;b&amp;c\\k&amp;e&amp;f\\l&amp;h&amp;i\end{vmatrix}}{\begin{vmatrix}a&amp;b&amp;c\\d&amp;e&amp;f\\g&amp;h&amp;i\end{vmatrix}} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;y = \frac{\begin{vmatrix}a&amp;j&amp;c\\d&amp;k&amp;f\\g&amp;l&amp;i\end{vmatrix}}{\begin{vmatrix}a&amp;b&amp;c\\d&amp;e&amp;f\\g&amp;h&amp;i\end{vmatrix}} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;z = \frac{\begin{vmatrix}a&amp;b&amp;j\\d&amp;e&amp;k\\g&amp;h&amp;l\end{vmatrix}}{\begin{vmatrix}a&amp;b&amp;c\\d&amp;e&amp;f\\g&amp;h&amp;i\end{vmatrix}} &lt;/math&gt;

In general: 
&lt;math&gt;Ax = b&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; x_i = \frac{|A_i|}{|A|} \; \forall i= \{1,\dots,n\}&lt;/math&gt;
Where &lt;math&gt;A_i&lt;/math&gt; is formed by replacing the vector associated with &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; by the column vector b.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Weak Axiom of Revealed Preferences===
The demand function &lt;math&gt;x(p,w)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the weak axiom of revealed preference if:&lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt;\forall (p,w),(p^{\prime},w^{\prime}) \mbox{ if } p x(p^{\prime},w^{\prime}) \leq w \mbox{ and } x(p^{\prime},w^{\prime})\neq x({p},{w}) \mbox{ then } p^{\prime}x({p},{w}) &gt; w^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
In words:&lt;br&gt;
The consumer faced with &lt;math&gt;(p,w)&lt;/math&gt; could have chosen $\funcd{x}{p^{\prime},w^{\prime}}$ but chose &lt;math&gt;x(p,w)&lt;/math&gt;, assuming the consumer chooses consistently, if $\funcd{x}{p^{\prime},\primd{w}}$ is ever chosen, &lt;math&gt;x(p,w)&lt;/math&gt; must not be affordable.  Hence, 
&lt;math&gt;p^{\prime}\cdot x(p,w) &gt; w^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>Rationale for undoing change to problem 39</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Limits with Graphs==
I removed the &quot;Limits with Graphs&quot; section that had instructions &quot;Given the following graph, evaluate the succeeding limits&quot; since there were no questions under that section.  I'd add a problem myself, but I'm not sure what was intended.  If someone wants to restore this section and add a problem, be my guest.  [[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 15:39, 8 April 2011 (UTC)

==Problem 39==
Someone had changed the function definition so that &lt;math&gt;h(2)=1&lt;/math&gt;.  I changed it back because the point of the exercise is to show that the limit isn't affected by the value of the function at the point of interest.  As long as the left and right limits agree, the limit at the point is defined, and is independent of the value of the function at that point.  --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 08:43, 24 August 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Order of Operations===

&lt;p&gt;The order of operations tells you what to do first when you see a problem.  This is something that you will keep for all levels of math.  The order of operations is fundamental even past Calculus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An acronym that helps memorize this order is P.E.M.D.A.S. &lt;br&gt;Another way to memorize it is by saying:&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Please &lt;center&gt;Parentheses&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Excuse &lt;center&gt;Exponents&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;My     &lt;center&gt;Multiplication&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Dear &lt;center&gt;Division&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Aunt     &lt;center&gt;Addition&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;Sally &lt;center&gt;Subtraction&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some examples of how this works:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Ex.1'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;(2+5)*3^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Solution'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;=(7)*3^2&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;=(7)*9&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;= 63&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we start the next example let's take a look on how this problem would look if we hadn't had the parentheses. &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;2+5*3^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;=2+5*9&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;=2+45&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;=47&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;As you can see doing things in a certain order really does change the outcome of the and equation.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;'''Ex.2'''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;(2+2)^2 + (3 - 2) * 5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Solution'''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;(4)^2 + (1) * 5 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;16 + 1 * 5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;16 + 5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;21&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">This page provides suggestions for formulating
optimization problems in GLPK &amp;mdash; be they expressed
as MathProg statements plus any required GLPSOL options
or coded up as custom programs which use
GLPK functions either directly or via bindings.

__FORCETOC__

== Big M ==

The [[w:Big_M_method|big M method]] is a method of formulating certain types of problem by introducing an artificial quantity &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; and assigning it a sufficiently large constant value.
Take, for instance, the following MathProg model whereby &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; has to be '''either''' less than parameter &lt;math&gt;x1&lt;/math&gt; '''or''' greater than parameter &lt;math&gt;x2&lt;/math&gt; and also where &lt;math&gt;x1 &lt; x2&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;pre&gt;
param x1;
param x2;
param M;
var x;
var b, binary;
# constraint is active when b = 0
s.t. c1 : x &lt;= x1 + b * M;
# constraint is active when b = 1
s.t. c2 : x &gt;= x2 - (1 - b) * M;
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; should be chosen such that it is close to the '''smallest''' value that does not reduce the solution space.  Selecting too large an &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; in the circumstances may result in a low quality solution due to numerical imprecision.  Further information on the big M method can be found in textbooks.

== Identifying all solutions ==

From time to time, the question arises of identifying all feasible solutions or all optimal solutions to a given LP, MIP, or IP optimization problem.
GLPK can only return one solution, which incidentally is guaranteed to be globally optimal by virtue of the feasible region being both convex and bounded.

This April 2011 [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-glpk/2011-04/msg00023.html thread] (one of several) discusses the merits of adding solution enumeration features to GLPK. One reason for providing all optimal (or even close to optimal) solutions is to allow subsequent human intervention to select which solution to deploy, based on secondary criteria not readily amenable to formal modeling.

=== All optimal solutions ===

In some cases, the optimal solution is not unique.

GLPK cannot enumerate all the optimal solutions.
Nevertheless, with the use of external coding, one can create an iterative method by which the current optimal solution is made infeasible by applying a spurious binary constraint and the modified problem then resubmitted.  On termination, the various solutions can be collected for further analysis.  This method is not deemed inelegant by any means.

provide further general background.
See also this January 2010 [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-glpk/2010-01/msg00171.html posting] which suggests the use of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COIN-OR_SYMPHONY#SYMPHONY symphony].

=== The ''N'' best solutions ===

A variation on this theme for IP and MIP problems is the requirement to identify the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; best solutions.  One strategy involves keeping a dynamic pool of good solutions, discarding and replacing these as better solutions are revealed.  The feasibility of this method has yet to be established but this May 2011 [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-glpk/2011-05/msg00075.html thread] should offer insights.

=== All feasible solutions ===

In some circumstances, all the feasible solutions are sought.

GLPK cannot enumerate all the feasible solutions.  A similar method to that described above can be used, but with the objective function set to null (or omitted).  
GLPK will naturally stop at the first feasible solution when the objective function is null.

An alternative is to use [[w:SCIP_(optimization_software)|SCIP]], which is also capable of counting the number of feasible solutions.  
The project [http://scip.zib.de homepage] has more details.  SCIP is released under the
[http://scip.zib.de/doc/html/LICENSE.html ZIB academic license], which precludes commercial use.

== Close-to-zero values ==

Automatically generated problems can easily become badly [[GLPK/Scaling|scaled]] if the routine that generates them also creates coefficients that are numerically close-to-zero &amp;mdash; say around 1.0e&amp;minus;10 in value &amp;mdash; either as an artifact of [[w:Floating-point_arithmetic|floating point arithmetic]], by poor design, or both.  Equally, a solution, whether from a hand crafted or generated problem, can be hard to interpret when the results are peppered with close-to-zero values.

GLPK does not offer support for input rounding &amp;mdash; the setting of any close-to-zero values to true zero on problem building.  That task remains the responsibility of the client code.   Neither does GLPK offer support for output rounding &amp;mdash; the setting of close-to-zero values to true zero on reporting.&lt;ref&gt;While a call to the deprecated &lt;tt&gt;lpx_set_int_parm(lp, LPX_K_ROUND, 1)&lt;/tt&gt; will still compile, it has no effect.&lt;/ref&gt;

The choice of a suitable tolerance at which to test and reset close-to-zero values is a decision for the client, but 1.0e&amp;minus;09 is sometimes suggested.

=== MathProg output ===

To omit close-to-zero valued variables when writing
out model results with MathProg &amp;mdash; in this case, from the matrix
&lt;tt&gt;x[i,j]&lt;/tt&gt; at a tolerance of 1.0e&amp;minus;03 &amp;mdash; 
use the following statement as a template:

&lt;pre&gt;
printf{i in I, j in J: abs(x[i,j]) &gt;= 0.001} &quot;...&quot;, x[i,j], ... ;
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can also invoke other conditionals to select or suppress output.
And you can call &lt;tt&gt;display&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Non-convex functions ==

A non-convex function &amp;mdash; be it a constraint or an objective &amp;mdash; ''cannot'' be represented directly using mixed-integer (linear) programming.  But in some circumstances, a non-convex function may be captured satisfactorily using a piecewise linear approximation. Croxton et&amp;nbsp;al (2002) describe three equivalent formulations.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The general method uses binary variables to &quot;switch in&quot; the required piecewise segment and relies on [[w:Special_ordered_set|special ordered set of type 2]] (SOS2) constraints. The following document, [http://winglpk.sourceforge.net/media/glpk-sos2_02.pdf glpk-sos2.pdf], explains in detail how to model non-convex piecewise linear functions in GLPK.

== Nonlinear objective functions ==

=== Extremum terms ===

A nonlinear objective function in the form

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{minimize}\ z = \max(x_1, x_2) + \max(x_3, x_4) + \dots
&lt;/math&gt;

can be modeled as an LP (the objective function is still convex) using GLPK MathProg as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
z =  max_x1_x2 + max_x3_x4 + ...

s.t. max_x1_x2 &gt;= x1
     max_x1_x2 &gt;= x2
     max_x3_x4 &gt;= x3
     max_x3_x4 &gt;= x4
     . . .
&lt;/pre&gt;

The more complicated case

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{minimize}\ z = \max(x_1, x_2) + \max(x_3, x_4) - \min(x_5, x_6) - \dots
&lt;/math&gt;

can be tackled by substituting &lt;math&gt;+\max(-x_5, -y_6)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;-\min(x_5, y_6)&lt;/math&gt; as the two are equivalent.
Using a similar idea, the case of maximization

&lt;math&gt;
\mathrm{maximize}\ z = \min(x_1, x_2) + \min(x_3, x_4) - \max(x_5, x_6) - \dots
&lt;/math&gt;

can be similarly transformed by multiplying through by minus one (not shown).
Refer to this April 2011 [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-glpk/2011-04/msg00071.html thread] for more information.

=== SLP techniques ===

[[w:Successive_Linear_Programming|Successive linear programming]] (SLP)
employs [[w:Taylor_series|Taylor series]] expansions to approximate
nonlinear objective functions.  See this April 2011
[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-glpk/2011-04/msg00062.html thread]
for a discussion on SLP techniques and GLPK and, in particular, the 
management of GLPK problem objects and use of warm starts.  Note also the
[[w:C_Sharp_(programming_language)|C#]]
example file &lt;tt&gt;t1.cs&lt;/tt&gt; in the GLPK examples directory.

== Special ordered sets ==

=== SOS1 : special ordered set of type 1 ===

A
[[w:Special_ordered_set#Types_of_SOS|special ordered set of type one]] (SOS1),
sometimes notated
&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SOS1}(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt;,
means that, at most, only one of the variables can be
non-zero.

If all the variables are binary, SOS1 is equivalent to, in MathProg:

&lt;pre&gt;
x[1] + x[2] + ... + x[n] &lt;= 1
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the variables are continuous, assuming that &lt;tt&gt;0 &lt;= x[j] &lt;= u[j]&lt;/tt&gt;, where
&lt;tt&gt;u[j]&lt;/tt&gt; is an upper bound of &lt;tt&gt;x[j]&lt;/tt&gt;, SOS1 can be modeled in MathProg
thus:

&lt;pre&gt;
x[j] &lt;= u[j] * z[j]  for j = 1,...,n,
z[1] + ... + z[n] &lt;= 1,
&lt;/pre&gt;

where &lt;tt&gt;z[j]&lt;/tt&gt; are auxiliary binary variables.

=== SOS2 : special ordered sets of type 2 ===

Please refer [[GLPK/Modeling_tips#Non-convex_functions|here]].

As an example of SOS2 modeling of a piecewise linear function in mathprog, here is a simple example of creating a piecewise linear model of electricity pool price based on published price sensitivities in the Queensland region in the Australian National Electricity Market. Each half hour in the market, the price sensitivity is calculated for every half hour trading interval prior to the actual trading interval. For the period ending 2012-11-22 13:00 the following price sensitivities were published:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Demand offset (MW) !! Price
|-
| -500 || $49.47
|-
| -200 || $51.54
|-
| -100 || $51.97
|-
| +100 || $56.09
|-
| +200 || $57.25
|-
| +500 || $155.01
|-
| +1000 || $450.34
|}

To determine the price at any demand offset '''-500 MW &lt;= x &lt;= +1000 MW''' then the following GLPK mathprog model can be run:

== Network programming problems ==

The term &quot;network programming&quot; derives from [[w:Operations_research|operations research]].
The underlying mathematics falls under [[w:Graph_theory|graph theory]]
and, in particular, that part devoted to [[w:Digraph_(mathematics)|digraphs]].

One commonly encountered network programming task is the
[[w:Minimum_cost_flow_problem|minimum cost flow problem]] (mincost)
which seeks a set of network flows that minimize a given set of
flow-dependent specific costs.  The mincost problem can be used
to model a surprising wide range of practical
optimization questions.

GLPK offers specialist support for network programming
through the DIMACS graph data format and various
network algorithms.

=== DIMACS graph format ===

GLPK supports a variation of the DIMACS format for
graph theory problems.  The details are covered
comprehensively in the official documentation and are
therefore not repeated here.
Additional background can be found on the [[GLPK/Interoperability#Overview|interoperability]]
page.

=== API calls ===

GLPK supports the out-of-kilter mincost algorithm
through the function &lt;tt&gt;glp_mincost_okalg&lt;/tt&gt;.  Again
consult the official documentation for more details.

In terms of relative complexity, one user reports
(April 2011) that, in round terms, out-of-kilter runs
about 5 times faster than simplex, for the same
problem, and uses 2/3 the memory.

Version 4.49 of GLPK adds the relaxation method from Bertsekas and Tseng for solving [[w:Minimum_cost_flow_problem|minimum cost flow problems]].  On large instances, [http://web.mit.edu/dimitrib/www/noc.htm RELAX-IV] should be 100&amp;ndash;1000 times faster than
the standard primal simplex method.  This feature is a translation from the original [[Fortran]] code and is now licensed under [[w:GPL|GPLv3]].  The API call is through function &lt;tt&gt;glp_mincost_relax4&lt;/tt&gt;.  The algorithm itself was developed by Dimitri Bertsekas at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
| last1       = Bertsekas
| first1      = Dimitri P
| last2       = Tseng
| first2      = Paul
| title       = RELAX-IV: a faster version of the RELAX code for solving minimum cost flow problems
| url         = http://web.mit.edu/dimitrib/www/RELAX4_doc.pdf
| year        = 1994
| month       = November
| publisher   = LIDS, Massachusetts Institute of Technology
| location    = Boston, USA
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither &lt;tt&gt;glp_mincost_relax4&lt;/tt&gt; nor &lt;tt&gt;glp_mincost_okalg&lt;/tt&gt; allow non-integer data &amp;mdash; all flow lower bounds, arc capacities, and per-unit costs should be integer-valued (although they are passed to their respective functions as type [[w:Double_precision|double]]).

=== Minimum cost flow (MCF) problem benchmarks ===

Below are some benchmarks for a subset of Klingman's standard minimum cost
flow instances (generated by &lt;tt&gt;glp_netgen&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;glp_netgen_prob&lt;/tt&gt;).

|}

OKALG is the out-of-kilter algorithm.

See this 
[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-glpk/2013-04/msg00047.html posting] for more details.

=== GLPSOL ===

Unfortunately, GLPSOL &amp;mdash; the command-line
interface to the GLPK solver &amp;mdash; does not provide
access to the network programming algorithms.  The
&lt;tt&gt;--mincost&lt;/tt&gt; option currently only indicates that
the data to be input is in DIMACS format.  As of April
2013, GLPSOL solves a mincost problem by converting it
to a linear program and then calling the simplex
solver.  The out-of-kilter and RELAX-IV algorithms are
not available in this context.

=== Third-party initiatives ===

[[w:LEMON_(C%2B%2B_library)|LEMON]] is an open source
graph library written in [[w:C%2B%2B|C++]] which,
because it is part of the COIN-OR project, can
communicate with the GLPK solver.  The LEMON interface
supports combinatorial optimization tasks related
specifically to graphs and networks and can recognize
an number common graph-based data structures.  LEMON is
release under the Boost free software license.

== Sets and numbers ==

A set contains objects &amp;mdash; such as numbers,
strings, and other sets.  A set cannot 
be said to hold numeric entries, but &lt;tt&gt;param&lt;/tt&gt;'s can.  So the
trick is to create a &lt;tt&gt;param&lt;/tt&gt; array that translates the
number objects in a set into their numeric value.  Consider the following code:

&lt;pre&gt;
model;
param tmax;
set T:= 1..tmax;
param tt{t in T} := t;

data;
param tmax := 720;
end;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Later on in the model section, use the construct:

&lt;pre&gt;
tt[t]
&lt;/pre&gt; 

to recover a genuine value &amp;mdash; one that can be manipulated or printed
as a floating point number.

Primary spermatocytes undergo meiosis, which consists of DNA duplication (yielding tetraploid cells: two copies of each chromosome, each copy consisting of two sister chromatids), genetic recombination, and two maturation divisions. The product of the first maturation division are secundary spermatocytes (diploid: one copy of each pair of chromosomes, consisting of two sister chromatids), the second maturation division yields spermatids (haploid). 
The first maturation division takes days, and therefore the successive stages of this division can easily be discerned:

The daughter cells of the first meiotic division are known as secundary spermatocytes (diploid). The second meiotic division is also completed quickly, and therefore secundary spermocytes are neither easily discernible. The resulting cells of the second meiotic division are:

      <text xml:space="preserve">===The Fundamental Theorems of Calculus===

&lt;p&gt;In order to understand the fundamental theorem of calculus we must first understand what an Antiderivative is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An antiderivative of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is any function, often denoted by &lt;math&gt;F(x)&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;F^{\prime} (x)= f(x)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int f(x) = F(x) + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's do some practice on this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Ex.1'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Find the antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;f(x)=x^3&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;F(x) = \frac {1}{4} x^4 + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The C stands for some constant.  The reason for this is when you differentiate the stand alone constants become 0&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you differentiate this problem you will end up with &lt;math&gt;x^3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, the antiderivative of &lt;math&gt;x^k&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{k} * x^{k +1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Ex. 2'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(x)= x^2 + 3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int x^2 + 3 \operatorname {d}x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \int x^2 \operatorname {d}x + \int 3 \operatorname {d}x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \frac {1}{3} x^3 + 3x + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When dealing with functions that have a plus or minus in them you can integrate the separately to help you out and really focus on what is going on.  With enough practice you won't need to do this.  Remember to keep the appropriate sign between the integrals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Ex. 3'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;f(x)=85x^7&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;F(x)= \int 85x^7 \operatorname {d}x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;F(x) = 85*\int x^7 \operatorname {d}x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;F(x) = 85[\frac {1}{8} x^8]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;F(x) = \frac {85}{8} x^8 + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was done here was a constant multiplier was pulled out.  When you have a common constant multiplier in a function, you can pull it out of the integral to make it easier to evaluate.  Just don't forget to multiply it back in when you are done.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;font size=&quot;16&quot;&gt;Your own proxy and VPN on Amazon EC2&lt;/font&gt;



It is trivial to setup your own private proxy server on Amazon EC2, and with a little extra work, a VPN server.  It is much simpler when both the client and server are Linux machines.  The following is based on Ubuntu 10.10.  Starting from 2010, Amazon provides a free tier service for a duration of 1 year.

Although all the setups for daily use seem complicated, all can be automated by scripts, or otherwise, from experienced users. Images of EC2 instants can be provided without modifications. Everything else for the client can be put in one script, launchable by an icon via the GUI, for transparent initialization during login, and swapping between VPN and direct traffic.

==Starting an EC2 instant==

First, sign up an account on Amazon and EC2.  Although you can get free services for one year, a credit/gift card is required for the possible charges for services on higher tiers.  Also, there is the possibility of telephone verification, to which Google Voice service is acceptable.

The Amazon Management Console now allows you to start an EC2 instant with full GUI interface.  You can change to the management API when you are more familiar with the services.  Officially, Ubuntu provides several AMI's.  A machine image for Ubuntu 10.10, 64-bit server is ami-cef405a7.  

When you start your instant, you must pick the micro-tier if you want to try the free service.  The default is not free.

When you start the instant, you need to select a security group. This is basically setting the firewall for your instant.  You can pick the default or create a new security group called, say, openvpn.  From the drop down list, you have to pick at least SSH.  If you will be having a web server, pick HTTP and HTTPS as well.  For OpenVPN, you have to create a custom item, with port 1194 and protocol UDP.

==Private sock proxy server==

Once your instant is running, you need to find the Public DNS from the management console, for example, ec2-173-69-101-128.compute-1.amazonaws.com.  The next step is to setup a secure terminal connecting to the server, the same as a terminal at your local machine - the client machine.  The management console will also generate a key file for you to download to your local machine.  At your local Ubuntu machine, start up a terminal.  This command setup a secure terminal to the server, via SSH, and a sock proxy at 9667:

:ssh -D 9667 -i yourkeyfile.pem ubuntu@eec2-173-69-101-128.compute-1.amazonaws.com

This is already a secure tunnel for your http traffic.  At your browser, such as Firefox, set the sock host to 127.0.0.1, type 5, and port 9667. You have to leave all other host empty, including the http host.  Now you have your Amazon IP as your apparent IP, and the traffic between Amazon and your local machine is encrypted.  For security, change the access mode of the key file with &quot;chmod 600 yourkeyfile.pem&quot;

==VPN Server configuration==

For VPN, you need to install OpenVPN at the server terminal:

:sudo apt-get update
:sudo apt-get upgrade -y
:sudo apt-get install -y openvpn

Now generate a static key for a simple private one to one VPN (change mode to 600):

:openvpn --genkey --secret static.key

OpenVPN itself setup a secure tunnel and nothing else.  For using as a proxy, you need to load the iptable NAT module, setup IP forwarding and NAT.  Maybe not all steps are necessary:

:sudo modprobe iptable_nat
:echo 1 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
:sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.1/24 -o eth0 -j MASQUERADE

Then you need a server configuration file, server.conf, a text file that contains:

:dev tun
:ifconfig 10.8.0.1 10.8.0.2
:secret static.key
:comp-lzo
:keepalive 10 60
:ping-timer-rem
:persist-tun
:persist-key

Only the first 3 lines are necessary.  As recommended by OpenVPN, the rest is to keep the VPN alive for longer when there is no traffic, typically in a firewall NAT environment.

Starting OpenVPN at the server:

:sudo openvpn server.conf

==VPN Client configuration==

Install OpenVPN on your local machine:

:sudo apt-get install -y openvpn

To redirect all network traffic to the VPN:

:sudo modprobe tun
:sudo iptables -I OUTPUT -o tun+ -j ACCEPT
:sudo iptables -I INPUT -i tun+ -j ACCEPT

These are probably not necessary.  Now before you start OpenVPN at your local machine, you need to download the same key file at the server - static.key.  The simplest is to use any text editor with cut and paste, then change mode to 600.

The client configuration file, client.conf, contains:

:remote ec2-173-69-101-128.compute-1.amazonaws.com
:dev tun
:ifconfig 10.8.0.2 10.8.0.1
:secret static.key
:redirect-gateway def1
:comp-lzo
:keepalive 10 60
:ping-timer-rem
:persist-tun
:persist-key

Only the first 4 lines are necessary.  Redirection protects all your traffic and allows proxy chaining at your browser.  The rest keep the tunnel alive longer when traffic is idle.    

To start OpenVPN at the client:

:sudo openvpn client.conf

You can see from the server and client terminals that if the VPN connection is successful.  You can also ping 10.8.0.1 and 10.8.0.2 at the server and at the client.  Pinging itself has much faster response than pinging the other machine in the VPN.

==DNS server==

For better security, use the DNS server at Amazon over the VPN. Save a copy of the original DNS server file:

:sudo cp /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf.save

Create the file /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf.aws, which contains:

:nameserver 172.16.0.23

To use the Amazon DNS server:

:sudo cp /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf.aws /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf

Whenever you change network settings such as the DNS server, you need to restart the network interface:

:sudo ifdown -a
:sudo ifup -a

==Restarting the VPN==
You only need to setup the Openvpn server once.  Unless you terminate it, the state of your installed Openvpn will be preserved.

At the time of writing, keepalive do not work for periods of long inactivity.  The client needs to be restarted.

To kill the VPN server or client, type control-C at the respectively terminals if your openvpn is running in the foreground.  If not successful for any reasons, use &quot;sudo killall openvpn&quot;.  The Amazon DNS server has an internal address, DNS will not work when the VPN is killed.  You have to restore your previous DNS server:

:sudo cp /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf.save /etc/resolvconf/run/resolv.conf

And then restart the network interface as above.  You can leave your EC2 instant on for free, or stop it and restart it later.  If you terminal it, you have to start installing OpenVPN all over again.

All the commands  above are one off, unless you terminate your instant, or reboot your local system.  To restart the VPN, the only commands are:

:sudo openvpn config-file

at the server and the client machines.  Also you need to swap the DNS server.

==Proxy chaining==

When the VPN is on, the IP of your browser takes on that of your EC2 machine, even if your browser uses no proxy.  You can set the http proxy at the browser to any other network proxies, resulting in a proxy chain.  Secure proxies like Ultrasurf do not work on Linux, but the WINE software can load and execute this and many legacy Windows program.

==VPN over restrictive firewalls==

If your machine is protected by a restrictive firewall, you can use [http://alestic.com/2009/05/openvpn-ec2#comments tcp over port 80] for example.  But the speed is a lot slower than the default UDP.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Even though there isn't a common way to calculate development speed, in recent trenda, software communities have started using the terms velocity and burn down.

The term velocity (just like is physics) is how fast the team, from the starting point until the goal. In the software project this should be how fast the team finishing the story point per iteration.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A monopolist produces a good with the demand function &lt;math&gt;q(p)&lt;/math&gt; which (by assumption) has an inverse &lt;math&gt; p(q) &lt;/math&gt; and costs given by &lt;math&gt;c(q)&lt;/math&gt;. Since it supplies the entire market, the monopolist simultaneously chooses output and price. Thus, the profit maximization problem may be written two ways;&lt;br&gt;

==Cross Compiler==

Building from the AROS and AROS-contrib tree for i386 takes a long time and often requires fairly recent versions of the software, and trying to do it under a slow emulation with obsoleted versions of build tools or on real m68k hardware isn't going to make the job any less painful. 

It makes more sense to create a gnu m68k-amiga cross compiler environment under GNU-Linux or FreeBSD or windows and try building AROS for m68k-amiga target. Transfer files over and test out compatibility with UAE or amiga-forever. It is recommended to create a [http://tinderbox.dev.gentoo.org/default-linux/m68k/ 68k-Linux-hosted] AROS and testing it within Aranym. That way you don't need to worry about the custom chips in the beginning. You don't need to write any new drivers; the existing ones for other Linux-hosted AROS flavours should work.

From [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?start=40&amp;topic_id=5705&amp;viewmode=flat&amp;order=ASC&amp;type=&amp;mode=0 here] and if you remove this complete and the g++ files i post link are in, then G++ should build with the c++ lib. 

 --enable-languages=c


&lt;pre style=&quot;white-space: pre-wrap;&quot;&gt;
Download latest Ubuntu image.

Start vmware, let it install using automatic installation, everything is done automatically, when it is ready, it boots directly to desktop. Select synaptics package manager from admin menu, select and install all packages I listed...

Packages needed:

binutils-source
libcloog-ppl-dev (adds lots of other dependencies)
g++
libelf-dev
bison
flex
gcc-4.5-source
libmpfr-dev
libmpc-dev
libecm-dev

exit
&lt;/pre&gt;

then follow my guide. It takes only 30mins or so. 

 add PATH=$PATH:/opt/m68k-elf/bin to ~.bashrc



Just tried a build myself on 12.10 and it worked. This was my configure line:

CC=gcc-4.6 /home/weissms/aros/aros-src/configure --target=amiga-m68k --enable-ccache --with-portssources=~/aros/Sources --with-aros-toolchain-install=/home/weissms/media/data/aros/build/crosstools/

m68k-amiga-aros-ar is a link pointing to /home/weissms/media/data/aros/build/crosstools/m68k-aros-ar



After about 4 hours of building under my VirtualBox Linux machine it finally aborted with this:
Make sure you have up to date tree. That file was broken few days ago. (r46006) 
btw, there is no need to compile everything, bootable setup only needs workbench and kernel-link-amiga-m68k targets. 
AFAIK non-m68k drivers are not disabled because no one has bothered and at least in theory most of them can work via Amiga Zorro PCI bridge. Intel GMA of course can't work :) 



Anyone tried to make a g++ cross-compiler for 68k ? Or there are simpler ways, maybe, to compile owb for aros 68k ? 
This is [http://archives.aros-exec.org/share/network/browser/odyssey-1.16.2.src-aros.zip Fab's Odyssey]. The build is not coupled with AROS build system. It does require cmake though and some of the libs that are not built in contrib by default. (and it takes 1 hour to build on 3Ghz machine with -j 3) 




I made a 680x0 cross-compiler for the MegaDrive (it also includes an SH2 cross-compiler, but that's easy enough to cut). It's a generic build of 4.5.2, however, it may not have the flags wanted. Here's the

&lt;/pre&gt;

Note things like the thread model, disabled thread local storage, etc. Those would need to be changed in the makefile that builds the toolchain. The process and files I use to build the toolchain can be 
found at [http://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=889 GenDev] 

It can be altered fairly easily to accommodate whatever flags AROS needs as well as a different default target CPU (current set to 68000). 




===Build===

Use svn to get latest tree.

&lt;pre&gt;
cd ~
mkdir build
cd build

(It is very important to have separate build tree, do not compile inside source tree)

 ../AROS/configure --target=amiga-m68k --with-optimization=&quot;-Os&quot; --with-serial-debug --disable-mmu 
(do not change optimization setting, it is not going to work) 
 make
(wait until you get some error, it is some package that is not yet m68k compatible, not important) 

 make kernel-link-amiga-m68k

rom images are now in distfiles

make workbench to create full wb setup
&lt;/pre&gt;

Hmm. Looks like .text alignment is not allowed on your cross compiler. What version of m68k gcc are you using? If you used the arch/m68k-amiga/doc/build-toolchain.sh script, this is the version you should have: 

&lt;pre&gt;
$ m68k-elf-gcc -v
Using built-in specs.
COLLECT_GCC=m68k-elf-gcc
COLLECT_LTO_WRAPPER=/opt/m68k-elf/libexec/gcc/m68k-elf/4.5.1/lto-wrapper
Target: m68k-elf
Configured with: ../configure --without-headers --disable-threads --disable-libssp --disable-nls --disable-shared --without-pic --prefix=/opt/m68k-elf --target=m68k-elf --program-prefix=m68k-elf- --enable-languages=c
Thread model: single
gcc version 4.5.1 (GCC)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The i386 and x86_64 build use a &quot;fake crosscompiler&quot; (host's gcc + configuration). I think you should look at how mingw32 port is build - it uses real, prebuild crosscompiler for the complete chain AFAIK (ask Pavel Fedin for more info). If you would follow this approach, we could even setup nightly builds on VPS for your port - something I think would be very important in order not to introduce regressions int m68k by people working on other ports.

If a lot of stuff gets added to &quot;generic&quot; targets (e.g. linklibs), and then used via that same target, which is causing a lot of unrelated stuff to get built when you try and use a specific target. It would be nice (IMHO) if these targets where only used to group the main system objects and not just everything, and have the mmakefiles correctly use the dependency targets for the modules they actually use. 

The target should be to get rid of all includes and linklibs as metadependencies not extend them.

Core-linklibs is the metatarget for the linklibs added by default by gcc. Programs using some linklibs need to explicitly provide the proper dependency in their mmakefile.

It's my binutils' 'strip' that is eliminating the .rela.text and .rela.rodata (zero sized). From what I know we should not use strip as a separate command on AROS binaries. We can however add -s to command line of linker. 
Not to use strip explicitly as it removes some symbols which are needed for AROS programs to work. 

 --strip-unneeded --remove-section .comment 

is OK but pure &quot;strip&quot; creates corrupt binaries. 

I had to change the Graphics/*LayerRom family to use A4 instead of A5, since GCC seems to want to believe that the A5 frame pointer is immutable. how about &quot;-fomit-frame-pointer -fcall-saved-reg-a5&quot; options? 
Could you add ugly wrapper in layer jump table that switches registers? (similar to Disable() and friends)
Did this also cause the unexplained boot menu crash? 

but:

* GCC treats -fomit-frame-pointer as a hint, not a requirement. The reload1.c algorithm in GCC can force the use of a frame pointer, regardless of the 'omit-frame-pointer' setting. 

* GCC when the frame pointer (%a5) is in use, due to the above explanation, I get the following error: 

 cc1: error: can't use 'a5' as a call-saved register

The biggest problem is not how pervasive this issue is, but how *rare*. If it was a *huge* problem, then I could just suck it up and deal with the changes that would cause huge bloat. 

As it is, the following are the all calls in AROS (that are defined in *.conf files) that could have issues, which means I can't justify huge bloat: 

&lt;pre&gt;
rom/exec/exec.conf:
    ULONG Supervisor(ULONG_FUNC userFunction) (A5)
rom/expansion/
    UCF5 calls to the ROM diagPoint
rom/dos/

rom/graphics/graphics.conf:
    void LockLayerRom(struct Layer *l) (A5)
    void UnlockLayerRom(struct Layer *l) (A5)
    BOOL AttemptLockLayerRom(struct Layer *l) (A5)

workbench/libs/popupmenu/popupmenu.conf:
    APTR PM_OBSOLETEFilterIMsgA(struct Window *window, struct
PopupMenu *pm, struct IntuiMessage *im, struct TagItem *tags) (A1, A2, A3, A5)

workbench/libs/datatypes/datatypes.conf:
    ULONG DoDTDomainA(Object *o, struct Window *win, struct Requester
*req, struct RastPort *rport, ULONG which, struct IBox *domain, struct TagItem *attrs) (A0, A1, A2, A3, D0, A4, A5)
&lt;/pre&gt;

I have some ideas, but they all have some disadvantages: 

* Make a stack-parm wrapper for all library functions, that then calls the real regcall functions via jsr NN(%a6). 
&lt;pre&gt;
+ In this model, the AROS_LH* macros generate _Exec_Foo (stackcall) wrappers for Exec_Foo (regcall). AROS_LC* macros would call the _Exec_Foo stackcall wrappers 
+ AmigaOS 3.x apps would work unchanged against the ROM
- Unneccessary bloat for the ROM. This bloats all calls in the ROM to fix only 10 calls. 
- Only works for the ROM. Things get out of hand and messy for building the AROS user-space libraries and apps. 
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Make an additional library call for each of the affected libcalls that use A4 instead of A5 (i.e. Exec/Supervisor_A4), and fix up the callers to have a '#define Supervisor Supervisor_A4' somewhere appropriate in their headers. Then define an asm stub for each function that saves A5 and moves A4 into A5, calls the real routine, 
then restores A5. 
&lt;pre&gt;
+ Relatively low impact, only affects the problem APIs
+ Will work with existing AmigaOS 3.x apps
+ No problems with compiling AROS apps
- May have to get genmodule in the act to get this to work cleanly.
- Will *permanently* affect the AROS ABI for m68k, and consume library call slots for *ALL OTHER ARCHITECTURES*.
&lt;/pre&gt;


* Fix gcc to give diagnostics when it feels 'forced' to use a frame pointer, sufficient to allow a programmer to make the correct changes so that gcc would not make a frame pointer in that routine. 
&lt;pre&gt;
- This code is very convoluted and ugly. I tried this once, and ran away screaming.
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Fix gcc to never need a frame pointer on m68k
&lt;pre&gt;
  - This may be impossible. reload1.c is an impenetrable morass of evil.
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Fix gcc to recognize when the FP is going to be clobbered, and move the FP to an alternate register.
+ Would be a fantastic fix, and should be portable to other archs.
- Looks like this may be a huge task, or at least one outside my skill set.


* Make a M68K target backend for LLVM
&lt;pre&gt;
- Would distract from the AROS KS Phase I task for at least a month. 
- May run into intractable issues (fixed ABI definition per arch?, impossible to debug LLVM code generation issues?, etc)
+ HUGE long term benefits if we get it to work!
&lt;/pre&gt;




===GCC 2.95.3===

* gcc 2.95 is incredibly obsolete - AROS uses a number of GCC 3.x or higher features both at compile and link time.

* gcc 2.95 code generation is horribly bloated on m68k - far worse than gcc 4.5.1. For example, the 400K ROM text space on 4.5.1 with my regcall (broken) inline hacks bloated up to 1.2M on gcc 2.95. Unacceptable! - One of the worst cases was Exec/Forbid - it bloated from 2 instructions to 35!

The code generation bug I was hoping to avoid - it's evidently ancient, as 2.95.3 still generates the same bug in the same place. (it uses a lea %sp(#n),%a3 instead of move.l %sp(#n),%a3, due to an optimization issue in some corner cases). So, what I'm going to do now is focus on the 2.95.3 code optimization bug (which, sadly, shows up in PrepareExecBase), fix it, then port that patch up to gcc 4.5.1.
It's -fpic optimization, that gets corrupted by the register usage. -fno-pic squashes that bug for now, but I'll
need to re-investigate this when I need to make 'real' PIC libraries. 

GCC 2.95 (maybe not all versions of it, but IIRC 2.95.3 did) can produce wrong code for vararg macros like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
#define OpenWindowTags(arg1, ...) \
({ \
    IPTR __args[] = { AROS_PP_VARIADIC_CAST2IPTR(__VA_ARGS__) }; \
    OpenWindowTagList((arg1), (struct TagItem *)__args); \
})
&lt;/pre&gt;
Both on x86 and 68k. IIRC that was one of the reason for the switch to gcc 3.

that's from binutils assembler.to find the error you can use a switch, that the temp file is not delete.

to avoid the startup code the linker Option 
&lt;pre&gt;
nostarfiles 
noixemul
&lt;/pre&gt;

GCC 3.4 is too broken to compile ffmpeg with optimizer on.ffmpeg is build with GCC 4.5.0 (not the AROS Version).but compile to well with GCC 4.3.2 (was used before GCC 4.5 was out) 

only cygwin hosted GCC 4.3.2 and GCC 4.50 are here. with those compilers are many amiga Ports [https://sourceforge.net/projects/amiga/files/ compile].

on these compilers is also a text file how to build GCC.the 68k GCC is official support in GCC.so its easy to compile a GCC for your linux you like. 

I also recommend to use from the includes or ixemul the new math-68881.h.this is special modify to work with newer compilers. problem on GCC is on newer compiler after a asm line a \n\t need add.but newer asm code have this. 

i think optimizers are switch off in that AROS build.also default GCC create only 68000 code.

I can't see how they will fit all the things from just a 3.1 level kickstart without using tricks that the 4000T used, like moving Workbench.library to disk. That compiled C code will be bigger in almost every case. 
Most of AmigaOS 3.1 is written in C. dos.library was written in BCPL up to 1.3 &amp; converted to C for 2.0 (or even 1.4 beta?) IIRC they used several compilers, one being lattice. Which turned into SAS/C. Back in the gcc 2.95 days I did some benchmarks and the software I tried was quicker with gcc than SAS/C. There are many factors that will influence how large/fast AROS68K runs. It's far too early to even contemplate what it will be like. However CD32/A1200's can have 1mb kickstart, A500/A2000's needs wires added. No idea about A3000. 




=== VBCC ===

It appears that we have locked ourselves into the GCC family of compilers, due to the use of the idioms in compiler/include/asm.c 

These idioms are used to get the target's GCC C compiler to determine the offset of structure elements, and emit them as inline assembly. The inline assembly is then used to generate the assembly headers
files. 

The reason it's done this way is that the host compiler can't properly compute the offsets - say a Linux host (little endian, long aligned) compiling for m68k (little endian, short aligned). 
Was there any reason, in the history of AROS, for not using the #pragma pack(n) preprocessor directives? 
I think for the reason that pragma pack() gets you an approximation of how the cross-compiler would generate the structure offsets, but the asm.c method gets the offsets *precisely*. 
For most cases, pragma pack() will probably get you what you want (especially for PPC vs m68k, which have similar packing rules and the same endianness), but may not always get the right answers for, say, cross-compiling for m68k on x86. That should guarantee the same structure alignments and offsets, independant from the host-architecture and compiler being used. OS4 and MorphOS uses it and vbcc supports it too. I think OS4 only uses it for structures that where already defined in OS3.x. New structures don't use that packing. On 64 bit this would not be the case as pointers (and IPTRs who replace ULONGs) will take double space. PPC and m68k are similar in their packing rules, x86 can be very weird. We decided to use the native packing of the cpu for maximum speed reasons. 

Unfortunately, VBCC's inline assembly method doesn't allow for replacement operations in the assembly (it's stuffed as-is into the output file), so the asm.c method can't be used. Such a feature is not easily added. And even if it would exist, it doesn't help you with vbcc/vasm. I had a glance over asm.c, and it looks like it will insert #define directives into the assembler source. That cannot work with vasm, 
which doesn't run a C preprocessor over its input source (finally it is an assembler and knows nothing about C). For AROS/VBCC toolchain, I'm using only vbcc. cpp, as, ld, etc come from GCC/binutils. 
I didn't want to rewrite all my assembler, and I know the intricacies of the GNU toolchain pretty well. 
But you are aware that vasm does all the peephole-optimization work for the compiler? Without an optimizing assembler the code will be noticeable slower and larger. 
Easy. I use the '-gas' option to vbccm68k, and it emits AT&amp;T syntax.

For VBCC (or SASC, or any other 'Amiga style' compiler), the asm.c technique is not usable. 
There have been discussions about that before. Some people proposed to try to extract with some trickery the needed information out of object .o files. 
Another possibility is just hard code an cpu.i file for each cpu and don't let it generate by code. 
If I was to ask for *one* vbcc change, it would be supporting this idiom: 
&lt;pre&gt;
char array[];
int func(void) = &quot;movl #%d,d0\nret\nmova %s,a0\nmove a0@(d0),d0&quot;,1234,&quot;array&quot;;
&lt;/pre&gt;
Basically, be able to treat the inline assembly like a sprintf() string. 
If we had that, I could get asm.c to work under vbcc. 
Either you have an argument to the function, then you would write: 
 int func(__reg(&quot;a0&quot;) char *array) = &quot;...&quot;;

Or you will use a global variable:
 int func(void) = &quot;lea _array,a0 ...&quot;;

But you probably need something like:
 int func(void) = &quot;movl #%d,d0\nrts&quot;,offsetof(struct Task, tc_State);

It looks like we're stuck with GCC (and possibly LLVM) for all architectures. 
Yes, unfortunately not only for compiling the AROS system, but also for compiling AROS programs in general. I had already given up years ago trying to support AROS with vbcc, because the SDK seems to be designed for gcc only, and I don't want to patch it with every new release. :( 

I have some patches to support:

* Passing -include, -iquote, and -isystem to cpp
* Supporting __section( &quot;.with&quot; &quot;_string&quot; &quot;_concatenation&quot;)
* Void * arithmetic (yes, I know, non-C99, but AROS is *rife* with it)

Oh, one more thing. Here's my vc.config file, for your reference.

Of special interest is the arch/m68k-all/include/gencall.c helper, which generates the GCC glue macros that (hopefully) will get us a working native library API without too many GCC patches.

arch/m68k-amiga: Native Amiga support. Provides support for the stack-based and bincompat amiga-m68k builds.
The register based amiga-m68k did have compiler issues for some functions (like Exec/Forbid())

&lt;/pre&gt;

Use generic exec/preparecontext.c? because a lot of time was taken to make it usable on all systems... 
sigcore.h use must be avoided but use arch/m68k-amiga/kernel_cpu.h instead and define needed macros there.

There are plans to unify CPU context structures per CPU family and open them to the public. Or invent some API to manipulate contexts. So private context is a temporary thing. 

It is not known if we can safely use Disable()/Enable() in gallium. Better implement atomics for m68k. Generic atomics can be considered temporary hacks. Unfortunately, m68k CAS and TAS instructions are illegal on ChipRAM (see the Amiga HRM). We have to use Enable()/Disable() on m68k-amiga for read/modify/write.


Where is m68k AROS_LIBFUNC_INIT defined? in compiler/arossupport/include/libcall.h

this might be useful for debugging libcall entry and exit:

&lt;pre&gt;
#undef AROS_LIBFUNC_INIT
#define AROS_LIBFUNC_INIT if (SysBase-&gt;DebugAROSBase) bug(&quot;+%s\n&quot;, __func__); {
#undef AROS_LIBFUNC_EXIT
#define AROS_LIBFUNC_EXIT } if (SysBase-&gt;DebugAROSBase) bug(&quot;-%s\n&quot;, __func__); }
#endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

* Make a ROM that loads at 0xF00000 instead of 0xF80000 ('cartridge' space)
* The Amiga Kickstart at 0xF80000 will see the AROS ROM, and jump to it instead of its own Exec (happens automagically with KS 1.3 or later)
* The AROS Exec will scan *both* its ROM space *and* the KickStart ROM space, and use the KS ROM libraries to 'fill in the gaps' for hardware drivers.

This should let us get a 'Frankenrom' that will let more developers get a booting AROS that can load AROS m68k ELF programs and work on validation and KS library replacements. I will be FrankenROMing it with Amiga Kickstart 3.1's graphics, dos, mouse, keyboard, and trackdisk drivers to make sure I can get up to an AROS desktop. After that (which will validate exec.library and kernel.resource), I will continue to add AROS libraries (and remove KS 3.1 libs) until it's all AROS. 

An easier and more compatible way to do this:

Leave AROS ROM in 0xf80000 but add 0xE00000-0xE7FFFF to exec's resident structure scanning list.
Put required original KS modules to 0xE00000 &quot;extended rom&quot; area using romsplit and remus utilities.

Romsplit extracts KS rom modules and re-creates relocation data. [http://www.doobreynet.co.uk/beta/ Remus] can be used to build custom rom, relocated to any address you want. 

This is fully UAE compatible (no need for 0xf00000 hacks/UAE boot rom modifications), just configure extended rom image, also it is more real Amiga compatible too, 1M EPROM in place of original ROM maps 0xE0 and 0xF8 areas automatically. (except on Fat Gary based Amigas that lost 1M ROM capability for some reason, it works fine with A500/A600 and A1200). Real CD32 also does it this way. CDTV is the only &quot;weird&quot; Amiga that uses
0xF0 space. (0xF0 is also used by Blizzard 060 card). Note that 0xE0 normally mirrors 0xF8 (if normal 512K rom used), do not accidentally load modules twice :), also make sure 0xE0 ROM header is installed because PC at reset is loaded from 0xE0 ROM if installed. 



Where to scan for UAE ROM extensions (UAE HDF, UAE SCSI, etc.)? 

That ROM is normally located at 0xf00000 but it also includes fake autoconfig board, it mounts  automagically.
(at least in WinUAE it is PC-relative and can be moved to other locations, not sure about other UAE versions)

* &quot;Filesystem Autoconfig Area&quot; in memory map dump 
* &quot;UAE Boot ROM&quot; contains the code.

(again, not exactly sure if this is reported in other UAE versions)

Can you add a TCP port based serial emulation to WinUAE? That will make debugging much easier on your end. I have already pacthed my e-uae to do that. Or, if you are really into pain, you &gt;could implement a GDB stub TCP port on WinUAE.... I am always using separate winuae debug log window when debugging, serial to write_log() conversion is usually more than enough. 

this work in that way in winuae, that your amiga program need call a function.because uae.resource can be on different addresses, on newer winuae is some additional code need to read the vector to switch it on.

the vector 20 do the enforcer and serial to winuae console output enable.when d1 &amp; 1 !=0 enforcer is enable.
when d1 &amp; 2 !=0 then the serial at 9600 baud is send to winuae log file or console.but in some cases maybe wish faster serial output, maybe toni can change the code so a baud rate of lets say 600000 do too write to console and no switch is need. 

d1 &amp; 4 != 0 is the illegal address stop program mode.that's similar to grim reaper but on winuae you can jump on illegal address access to all graphical debuggers AOS have. 

all modes can switch during runtime.the serial mode is sticky, so when set once, after a reboot serial is write to winuae log console or windows too. 





===Flavour===

 amiga-m68k-eabi (ELF stack based ABI) - STANDALONE (obsolete) 
 amiga-m68k-aros (AROS register ABI for m68k) STANDALONE | NATIVE | BINCOMPAT

Drop NATIVE at all. This flag enabled some Amiga-specific quirks in the code (grep  for  it, you'll see). This can be handled by arch-specific code in kernel.resource and CPU-specific code somewhere. In some rare cases
where #ifdef is really needed (like returning something in a3 register)  you  can  better  depend  on BINCOMPAT, it's IMHO fits in better here.

One of the goals for the BINCOMPAT flavour is to eliminate the need for a BSS section for the ROM. This patch removes the BSS data for rom/kernel for the BINCOMPAT flavour, and puts KernelBase at M68K Vector 0 (right below SysBase). There were more BINCOMPAT changes recently. Note that there are other ports that are BINCOMPAT at the moment, though, they are not really because they lack compatible stucture packing. But they can become really binary compatible in the future, every port running on a big endian cpu can. What about your, port does it use some pragma pack(2) at some place? I guess we should add this for the BINCOMPAT ports now.

But even then, changes similar to the above will brake those other ports because they might need those globals. Here we need another solution. I came across all this because sam port wasn't booting anymore. For the moment I've switched it from ppcnative to standalone and it works again. 

All structs for gcc-m68k are implicitly pack(2). 

I would not introduce to manu AROS_FLAVOUR defines as the target is to get rid of them after ABI V1 and for SDK V1.
I would like to make modules with globals rommable. I would do this by linking these globals to an absolute address that is know to be in RAM. The first ROM initialization code would then reserve the right amount at the place where the globals are linked and initialize them. 

 AROS_FLAVOUR_NATIVE
Native OS's syscalls are used instead of Kernel

 AROS_FLAVOUR_STANDALONE
Kernel is used to directly control scheduling

 AROS_FLAVOUR_EMULATION
???

 AROS_FLAVOUR_LINKLIB
???

 AROS_FLAVOUR_BINCOMPAT
Binary compatible with AmigaOS 3.x APIs (both PPC and M68K)

I would like to add something to the effect of:

 AROS_FLAVOUR_ROM
No .bss nor .data segment allowed in rom/* libraries

If we keep the current flags until the ABI V1 switch nothing should get broken. For sam and efika port and lines like

#if (AROS_FLAVOUR &amp; AROS_FLAVOUR_BINCOMPAT)

I need additional information if this is for amiga hardware or just binary compatible. At the moment 16 byte stack alignment is not working or there is some direct hardware banging. This could be rewritten to use some more preprocessor symbols (which ones by the way?) separated into arch dependent macros or inlines or overridden with build_arch_specific.

I don't know how the flavour stuff is going to be changed for ABI V1 but I assume that informations about AROS_TARGET_ARCH and AROS_TARGET_CPU are needed, so what about placing those into our generated config.h already now. Then these could help in solving the above problem.


OK, what I want to have is config.h to contain something like:

#define AROS_TARGET_ARCH_AMIGA
#define AROS_TARGET_CPU_M68K

or

#define AROS_TARGET_ARCH_SAM440
#define AROS_TARGET_CPU_PPC

or

&lt;something else&gt;

depending on how configure was called.

Preprocessor symbols like HOST_OS_linux, HOST_OS_darwin or AROS_ARCHITECTURE that are used in some hosted modules can be generated and placed into config.h the same way. Could you make the configure.in changes, then I'll 'catch up' and fix the code to use those instead of BINCOMPAT where needed. 



Or should it be a separate 'CONFIG_ROMMABLE' or something?

One of the fundamental beauties of the AmigaOS Exec is that (with a few added hardware mutexes) SMP support
with a MMU is pretty trivial. Each CPU would have its own memory space, with its own SysBase, and you can create a special inter-cpu message pipe to send message to other CPUs. 

One way to do it would be to have (for example) CPU0 control all hardware, and all other CPUs would have proxy libraries that use GetMsg() to 'upcall' to CPU0 for hardware access. 

Of course, you could also divvy up hardware access among the CPUs, or any number of other possibilities. All CPUs would use the same read-only memory for holding the Exec/Intuitiuon/etc libraries, but each libraries' LibBase would be private per CPU.

I don't see how these two things conflict. It may be true that SMP aware drivers may not use global variables for efficiency but that does not mean that it should be forbidden for all drivers. I would like to be able to put any driver or library into ROM. For example for mobile devices with several MB of non-volatile memory. 
Giving each CPU/core its own memory space will give problems when you want to move processes between the CPUs/cores. I would have a copy of SysBase for each CPU but I would use the MMU to locate it at the same virtual address space. This would allow to move processes in between CPUs/cores. 

The old-style Amiga interrupt handlers had their condition code flag Z in %sr to determine whether the handler handled the IRQ. Unfortunately, there's really no clean way to support both old-style and new-style interrupt handlers, so for BINCOMPAT, we're just going to ignore the return code, and process all the handlers. 





===Flags and Calls===

Why not have TARGET_CC &amp; TARGET_CFLAGS and HOST_CC &amp; HOST_CFLAGS as optional vars when configuring AROS ? And just use well known default values for the usual case. This will be more flexible if we like to use some other compiler. 

The AROS_LC (Library Call) macros should use the AROS_LD (Library Declaration) family for casting - the AROS_LP (Library Prototype) is for the C stubs and prototypes, not for the Library ABI. 

&lt;pre&gt;
In the __AROS_LP_BASE(basetype,basename) macro, it is unsafe to ever use or return the 'basetype' element, since it is frequently corrupted by #defines, for example:

struct foo_data {
   struct GfxBase *GfxBase;
   ...;
}

#define GfxBase data-&gt;GfxBase

...

int blah_blah(struct foo_data *data, ...)
{
    AddDisplayDriverA(gfxhidd, &amp;tags);
    ...
}

In the above example, AddDisplayDriverA is defined as a call to __AddDisplayDriverA_WB(GfxBase, (arg1), (arg2)), which uses the AROS_LC2() macro, which uses the __AROS_LP_BASE() macro to cast the type. If __AROS_LP_BASE() returns the basetype, the macro expands to the following for the cast of the function pointer: 

(LONG (*)(APTR, struct TagItem *,struct GfxBase *))

Which is all fine, until GfxBase gets expanded:

(LONG (*)(APTR, struct TagItem *,struct data-&gt;GfxBase *))

So, if '#defineing' lib bases is an allowed idiom, then
__AROS_LP_BASE() must never return basetype, correct?
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
When I compiled some AROS libs (like diskfont.library) under AOS/68k I used:

/* What to do with the library base in header, prototype and call */
#define __AROS_LH_BASE(basetype,basename)   register basetype basename __asm(&quot;a6&quot;)
#define __AROS_LP_BASE(basetype,basename)   register void * __asm(&quot;a6&quot;)
#define __AROS_LC_BASE(basetype,basename)   basename
#define __AROS_LD_BASE(basetype,basename)   register basetype __asm(&quot;a6&quot;)

/* How to transform an argument in header, prototype and call */
#define __AROS_LHA(type,name,reg)     register type name __asm(reg)
#define __AROS_LPA(type,name,reg)     register type __asm(reg)
#define __AROS_LCA(type,name,reg)     name
#define __AROS_LDA(type,name,reg)     register type __asm(reg)
#define __AROS_UFHA(type,name,reg)    register type name __asm(reg)
#define __AROS_UFPA(type,name,reg)    register type __asm(reg)
#define __AROS_UFCA(type,name,reg)    name
#define __AROS_UFDA(type,name,reg)    register type __asm(reg)

 #define __AROS_LP_BASE(basetype,basename)   register void * __asm(&quot;a6&quot;)
 #define __AROS_LPA(type,name,reg)     register type __asm(reg)
&lt;/pre&gt;

You do realize that that made all your C stubs regcall instead of stack call, right?
I don't know if these C stubs are even used at all. They did not exist at all years ago. I don't think the AROS_LP macros are/were intended to be used for the prototypes of C stubs. They are meant to be used for the prototypes of the real libcalls (even if mostly unused because of the way the libcalls are done).
It's also illogical that the prototypes of the C stub would use the AROS_LP macros, while in the actual implementation (generated file #?_stubs.c) no macros at all are used. Because that means AROS_LP macros would always need to &quot;expand&quot; to normal C calling convention -&gt; why have AROS_LP macro in the first place?

The correct behaviour is for them to be used in the prototypes of real library calls and not be used for the stubs. There may be cases of odd compilers from the past where you needed to have separate prototypes and definitions, or it was just extra compatibility. They've been around probably since rev 1 or something. So my preference would certainly be to keep them, and fix the stubs.

#define are considered a hack and they should be avoided. When they are used people should take care they don't cause problems. It's not up to the AROS_LP macros to fix it. In the ABI V1 branch there is a mechanism so you can get rid of all these #define statements.

AROS_UFCx() should *only* be used for regcall routines. If VNewRawDoFmt() wants a stackcall routine, do NOT use AROS_UFCx(). Just declare a normal C routine. Yes, this is how it is done in MorphOS. I'm  sorry  for the breaking. I implemented VNewRawDoFmt() before the complete  docs  were  out. I was pretty sure nobody has used it with custom callback  routine.   In fact magic constants declared in exec/rawfmt.h cover 99% of function's usage. 

I notice that AROS program load is lots slower as on AOS. i look on AROS source, it look that file action to load_block go over several corners, and it look slow when use fgetc. Why the load_block func can not just do a AOS read ? is the elf file endian different to 68k platform endian ? 
Is a block not larger as 4 kb, and if so, its always lots faster to use Read direct and not use fgetc that's call from the elf loader

&lt;pre&gt;

static void * load_block

    BPTR               file,
    ULONG              offset,

    LONG              *funcarray,
    struct DosLibrary *DOSBase
)
{
    void *block = MyAlloc(size, MEMF_ANY);
    if (block)
    {
        if (read_block(file, offset, block, size, funcarray, DOSBase))
            return block;

        MyFree(block, size);
    }
    else
        SetIoErr(ERROR_NO_FREE_STORE);

===Optimisations===

Optimisation is a lot like bug-fixing, in that, though you would like to create the perfect product, reality is that you have a limited lifespan and you take care of the biggest problems first. Small bugs in non-essential parts of the program may remain unfixed if they don't make the product unusable. Likewise, slow routines that are used seldom may never get replaced, as the overall gain in speed may be negligible. 

The difference between the two is that a bug is absolute: Something either does what it is supposed and allowed to do under all circumstances, or it does not. If it does not, then the cause of that is called a bug. Optimisation on the other hand is relative. For optimisation for speed there's a trade-off. You can always get even better speed than your current solution, but at the cost of one or more other factors, like memory usage, disk space or maintainability. 

In development, especially that maintainability cost is a problem: If you're still developing, but you've made your code unreadable for the sake of speed, then it'll be impossible to find the remaining bugs. Generally, this is expressed as &quot;It's easier to optimise a working program than it is to make an optimised program work.&quot; Thus, in development, for the same piece of code, bug-fixing is given precedence over speed-optimisation. 

This would be a very strange phenomenon. Speed and clarity are usually trade-offs. What other factor would have been optimised that these both had suffered from? 

No, a good compiler can create fairly good code for most forms of abstract typing, object oriented programming included. There may indeed be some loss of speed, as that's the trade-of for having clearer source code. That clearer source code makes the debugging easier, of course, not harder. 

What Knud writes is that some programmers do try to write very speed-optimised code, and that that causes huge problems for debugging and maintenance. He says that for 97% of the time, it's a waste to do optimisation. Then he says that optimising too early is bad, but that we should optimise that 3%. 
(The implication is that you shouldn't optimise before you know you're in that 3% of the code.) 
On AROS there are only some few performance bottlenecks, load of exe, icon lib.and when fix that and do not optimize other AROS get a lot faster response to the User. This is indeed in line with what Knud says: If you know that the load of exe, icon lib or OO are in that three percent, whatever they may be, then the should be optimised for speed. 



Discovered that the attribute list that's passed to DoSuperNew() is invalid by the time it gets to the superclass's OM_NEW method (only the first ti_Tag value is above 0x80000000 for example). This can be worked around by using -O0 for NList_mcc.c and NListview.c. 

I suspect GCC decides to inline the DoSuperNew() method in those files when optimisation is enabled, and hence doesn't bother putting the varargs on the stack, with the result that the &amp;tag1 (AROS_SLOWSTACKTAGS_ARG(tag1)) that's passed to DoSuperMethod() as the attribute list isn't necessarily followed by the remaining tags. This probably means that we can no longer get away without using
AROS_SLOWSTACKTAGS on i386, since we shouldn't assume varargs are on the stack (but use va_list etc.).
Would introducing SLOWSTACKTAGS for ABIv0 break binary compatibility?





=== GCC Patches ===

My GCC 4.5.1 patches are not at all 'ready' for general consumption yet. I still have list corruption on the task ready and wait lists, and I am beginning to fear that there's a GCC bug hiding somewhere.

==ABIv1==

The function addresses are put in the LVO table of the library by listing them in the .conf file of the library. In any point in the library no matter how deep in the call chain  you can access the library base with the AROS_GET_LIBBASE macro (which actually just retrieves the value at the address pointed to by %ebx) (x86 code). So what advantage is there to this in existing code (which already passes the library base to subfunctions that need it) aside from burning the %bx register? 

In that case there is no real benefit because that code already works around shortcomings of the current amiga shared library implementation. For new code you can save the stack space used by all the libbases that are pushed on the stack for each function call. 

Personally I don't see a way on i386 to implement it without reserving %ebx for this. I choose %ebx as that is documented in the SYSV as global offset table base register for position independent code; I found it somewhat related. 

If you plan to use the %bx register, maybe it would be a better plan to use -fPIC compiled code, and use %bx to point to the ELF GOT table for that OpenLibrary() instance. This would make it easier for all ports, since -fPIC is well defined for ARM, x86, x86_64, m68k, and PPC. 

I did have a quick look at this but it seems that on i386 the code generated __GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE__ as an address, so the accesses are done through addresses and not through a register. This gives problems
on AROS where there is only one single address space and shared libraries are only loaded into memory once. 

Second problem I had with -fPIC is that it is an all or nothing approach: when you specify it all access to global variables are done through __GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE__. I did want to keep on supporting the 
current case where only the fields explicitly put in the library base are per opener (per task) and the rest of the global symbols. 

In general I found -fPIC too much oriented to UNIX systems with virtual memory and separated adress spaces per process. I am no expert in this so I am open to any false conclusions I have made. 

But it is true I need something alike -fPIC but adapted to AROS architecture: 
- On all cpu done through register call
- Possibility to set the register in stub code
- Possibility to remember the previous value of the register and restoreit after the function call. I don't think this is solved yet if using -fPIC as I assume it is solved during linking when a .so is met. 

I certainly don't want to copy the .so shared object concept to AROS (as AOS4 has done). 
- Possibility to only reserve the register for libbase and by default don't do all addressing of the global variables through GOT. 

For m68k, I believe the compile options we'll want for -fPIC are: 
 -fPIC -msep-data

And what is the effect on m68k if this option is specified ? How would I pass libbase through this mechanism ? 

And I forgot to mention that I do plan to use libbase in %ebx to make it possible to have modules without .bss or .data section without the need for these ugly #define xxxBase hacks. 

At the end of the day, I think we're going to have to stick our hands deep into the slimy guts of some compiler. Be it LLVM or GCC, I think the time is coming to pick an AROS compiler, and start whacking on it to support our needs. 

I would go even step further - would proper using of variadic lists break that much? AROS seems to be a research OS and the incorrect use of variadics is one of the places which could be improved quite a lot... Varadic lists are especially problematic for x86_64, since sizeof(void*) != sizeof(int).

As much as I would like to use them correctly, implicit vardics are heavily used (and abused) in almost all Amiga source code that uses BOOPSI. 

Breaking this assumption would break code like this (which is STUPIDLY common in my experience with porting to x86_64): 

&lt;pre&gt;
struct fooStruct {
     int a;
     char b;
     void *c;
};

struct booStruct {
    long qux;
    char *name;
};

#define fooID 0xf00
#define booID 0xb00

void handleMethod(ULONG methodID, ...)
{
   struct fooStruct *foo;
   struct booStruct *boo;

   switch (methodID) {
   case fooID:
       foo = (struct fooStruct *)((&amp;methodID)+1);
       handleFoo(foo);
       break;
   case booID:
       foo = (struct booStruct *)((&amp;methodID)+1);
       handleBoo(boo);
       break;
   }
}

...

handleMethod(fooID, 1, 'd', &amp;somebuffer);

handleMethod(booID, 99, &quot;Hello World&quot;);
&lt;/pre&gt;

Remember to undo rom.ld change, we are not responsible if you forget the modification and report future so called crashing &quot;bug&quot; due to  illegal 0xdeadxxxx addresses In rom :) 





Oh, I plan to make the m68k exceptions *identical* to AmigaOS on the stack when I call a processes' tc_TrapCode, but I need to know what the AROS Kernel sonic's been working on expects. 

By using the register declaration for %a6, gcc assumed all uses of %a6 were references to the AROS_GET_FP global variable. 

To get the frame pointer, you can't rely on %fp (or %bp, or anything like that), as GCC can clobber that if -fomit-frame-pointer is used.

__builtin_frame_address(1) should be what is wanted in this context anyway (frame pointer of the calling routine) 

In any case, %a5 is the frame pointer under AROS/m68k anyway, not %a6. 

I'm compiling and testing this right now, but this is the smoking gun according to 'git bisect'.



Fix the build. exec/types.h doesn't define size_t, sys/types.h does

stddef.h is even better as it is ANSI-C. sys/types.h is POSIX.




I search AROS code for text bestcmodeid, but i don't see that wanderer use that.So i think my modeid
does not match the install. use bestcmodeidtags is best, because the P96 mode numbers are different on all winuae systems. maybe Wanderer can change ? 

here is code from SDL. If a screen resolution is not here, this command give automatic the next possible modeid. 

&lt;pre&gt;
        okid=BestCModeIDTags(CYBRBIDTG_NominalWidth,SDL_Display-&gt;Width,
                CYBRBIDTG_NominalHeight,SDL_Display-&gt;Height,
                CYBRBIDTG_Depth,bpp,
                TAG_DONE);
        }
&lt;/pre&gt;

here is some source that show how it is possible to set a specific pixelformat with P96.it is test on 68k P96 and 68k CGX and report also on amiga GFX cards to work ok. 

&lt;pre&gt;
        if (bpp == 16)
      {
          UWORD pixfmt[] ={PIXFMT_RGB16,-1};
        unsigned long *ret;
          struct CyberModeNode * cnode;
        ret = AllocCModeListTags(CYBRMREQ_MinWidth,width,CYBRMREQ_MinHeight,height,
            CYBRMREQ_MaxWidth,width+1000,CYBRMREQ_MaxHeight,height+1000,
            CYBRMREQ_MaxDepth,bpp,CYBRMREQ_MinDepth,16,CYBRMREQ_CModelArray,&amp;pixfmt,TAG_END);
            if (ret)
                  {cnode = *ret;
                  if (cnode)okid = cnode-&gt;DisplayID;
                  }
      if (!IsCyberModeID(okid))okid = INVALID_ID;
      kprintf(&quot; RGB16  Mode ID %lx\n&quot;,okid);
      }
&lt;/pre&gt;

maybe its some of my winuae setting.is there a winuae config file that is known to work ?



Does anybody know a ABI reference for m68k ? Interested in the argument passing for a function call. 
All C language arguments are passed via the stack (for non-LVO calls). The return value from a C function is in D0. Registers D0/D1 and A0/A1 may be used as scratch by the called function, and the caller must expect them to have been trashed. Registers D2-D7 and A2-A7 must be preserved by the called function. 
(Some compilers allowed per-argument overrides, but they explicitly map a register to an argument)

More concrete: who owns A6 during a function call ? The caller. 
Is it preserved by a function call ? Yes, the callee must preserve it *if* it modifies it. 

register A6 is LibBase, A5 is Frame Pointer (optional), and A4 is the pointer to the .data/.bss area (for some compilers) 

A6 is that Library's libbase, and most of the intra-library calls in graphics.library are LVO (register) calls, so this is not surprising. 

GfxBase is an LVO call.

There are three or four main calling conventions in AmigaOS depending on who you ask.  I'm writing from memory so don't quote me exactly on this. 

C calling convention:  Slow as frozen molases and passes everything on the stack.  Supports variadic argumentss but other than that is practically worthless and usually optimized to another calling convention.  Returns result in D0.  Should not be used with shared libraries except for variadic arguments stub calls.

LVO calling convention:  LibCalls always allow D0/D1/A0/A1 to be used as scratch and are not preserved by the subroutine.  The remaining registers must be preserved by the subroutine.  The A6 register holds the library base always during this calling convention.  May preserve globals and locals heap in A4 unless large data model is used.  May have optional frame pointer in A5 used by debugger. 

Standard calling convention:  Just like LVO Calling convention except no library base is required.  Requires a stub function written in C calling convention to implement variadic arguments as they are not supported from here. 


Any benchmarks confirming this slowness ? If it is really that slow how come that C calling function is used for non library calls ? Of course the effect will be most noticeable on a CPU without data cache and only chip mem. Should we make the m68k AROS compiler use register argument passing for all function calls ? 

That said, stack cache is only present on an '060 so register passing is definitely preferred.  The reason the C calling convention is used is only for variadic arguments.  There is no other reason to use the C calling convention. The standard calling convention that uses register passing is MUCH more common. 

Also, regarding LLVM's calling conventions, there is another one supported by that compiler called the &quot;cold&quot; calling convention for subroutines that are not called often and when they are called, they need to leave as few registers touched as possible.  On a 68k that would mean using only scratch registers and 
stack without overwriting any of the other registers.  It is only needed for optimization and for compatibility with LLVM though. 

Although, a MMU is not required for Aros-m68k. The 68030 and 68040 use different supervisor instructions to access registers, (some) different supervisor registers and the register bit mappings are different, as well as page descriptors. 68030 MMU indeed supports more pagesizes, and in general is more flexible. The MMU design was simplified for 68040 to gain speed and reduce complexity. 68040 and 68060 MMUs are almost identical, 68060 just adding some more restrictions on caching of mmu tables and renaming few cachemodes. MMU exception processing is different on 68060, too. 




For the record, I wrote the m68k part of the kernel elf [http://dev.haiku-os.org/browser/haiku/trunk/src/system/kernel/arch/m68k/arch_elf.cpp loader] in Haiku: 
(though not much tested yet, kernel doesn't build anymore atm)

Btw, [http://www.revol@free.fr I] found an old binutils patch to add HUNK support to BFD in the archives of my Ti92 times (1997), surely this can be ported to newer binutils. It's odd none kept this around. I also recall writing some code to read hunks to convert to the ti format. (the first Ti 68k developments were done using a68k, and some people used amiga cross compilers before the times of tigcc.)</text>

There I saw 2 distinct meanings for the phrase &quot;Free-Thinker&quot;

1)Free-Thinker = One who has rejected authority and dogma, especially in religious thinking, in favor of rational inquiry and speculation.

2)Free-Thinker = a person who forms opinions about religion, politics, morals, etc., independently of tradition, authority, or established belief

see me on twitter-http://twitter.com/bibinbabyp

see me on facebook http://www.facebook.com/bibinbabyp

Link Of My Testimony-http://blogofthefreethinker.blogspot.com/2011/03/my-testimony.html

Yes,
Freethinker wants to crack all false philosophies and dis-beliefs in favour of rational inquiry and speculation independently of tradition, authority, or established belief

I am interested in the study of religions and religious books.but by belief I am a christian.I am an Electronics student at GPTC Kalamassery

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Ammeter===
An ammeter is an electronic instrument used to measure current.
:[[File:Zero-Center_Ammeter.JPG|200px]]

The ammeter's terminals must be ''in series'' with the current being measured.  Ammeters have a small resistance (typically 50 ohms) so that they only have a small effect on the current.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Frequency counter===
A frequency counter is a relatively simple instrument used to measure the frequency of a signal in Hertz (cycles per second). Most counters work by counting the number of signal cycles that occur in a given time period (usually one second). This count is the frequency of the signal in Hertz, which is displayed on the counter's display.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Logic analyzer===
A logic analyzer is, in effect, a specialised oscilloscope. The key difference between an analyzer and an oscilloscope is that the analyzer can only display a digital (on/off) waveform, whereas an oscilloscope can display any voltage (depending on the type of probe connected). The other difference is that logic analyzers tend to have many more signal inputs than oscilloscopes - usually 32 or 64, versus the two channels most oscilloscopes provide. Logic analyzers can be very useful for debugging complex logic circuits, where one signal's state may be affected by many other signals.

A voltmeter with extremely high input resistance capable of measuring electrical charge with minimal influence to that charge. Ubiquitous in nucleonics, physics and bio-medical disciplines. Enables the direct verification of charge measured in coulombs according to Q=CV. Additionally, electrometers can generally measure current flows in the femtoampere range, i.e. .000000000000001 ampere.

      <comment>/* FET operation */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==FET==
Field Effect Transistor is another type of transistor made from silicon material . The '''field-effect [[transistor]] (FET)''' relies on an [[electric field]] to control the shape and hence the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] of a [[channel (transistors)|channel]] of one type of [[charge carrier]] in a [[semiconductor]] material. FETs are sometimes called ''unipolar transistors'' to contrast their single-carrier-type operation with the dual-carrier-type operation of [[bipolar junction transistor|bipolar (junction) transistor]]s (BJT). The ''concept'' of the FET predates the BJT, though it was not physically implemented until ''after'' BJTs due to the limitations of semiconductor materials and the relative ease of manufacturing BJTs compared to FETs at the time. 

FETs are majority-charge-carrier devices. The device consists of an active channel through which majority charge carriers, electrons or holes, flow from the source to the drain. Source and drain terminal conductors are connected to semiconductor through ohmic contacts. The conductivity of the channel is a function of potential applied to the gate

==Types of FET==
There are two types of JFET 
# [[/N-channel JFET/]]
# [[/P-channel JFET/]]

==Construction==
: [[File:Lateral_mosfet.svg|200px]]

For the symbols in which the bulk, or body, terminal is shown, it is here shown internally connected to the source. This is a typical configuration, but by no means the only important configuration. In general, the MOSFET is a four-terminal device, and in integrated circuits many of the MOSFETs share a body connection, not necessarily connected to the source terminals of all the transistors.

== FET operation ==
[[Image:JFET n-channel en.svg|thumb|500px|I–V characteristics and output plot of a JFET n-channel transistor.]]

The FET controls the flow of [[electron]]s (or [[electron hole]]s) from the source to drain by  affecting the size and shape of a &quot;conductive channel&quot; created and influenced by voltage (or lack of voltage) applied across the gate and source terminals (For ease of discussion, this assumes body and source are connected). This conductive channel is the &quot;stream&quot; through which electrons flow from source to drain.

In an n-channel ''depletion-mode'' device, a negative gate-to-source voltage causes a ''[[Depletion zone|depletion region]]'' to expand in width and encroach on the channel from the sides, narrowing the channel. If the depletion region expands to completely close the channel, the resistance of the channel from source to drain becomes large, and the FET is effectively turned off like a switch. Likewise a positive gate-to-source voltage increases the channel size and allows electrons to flow easily.

Conversely,  in an n-channel ''enhancement-mode'' device, a positive gate-to-source voltage is necessary to create a conductive channel, since one does not exist naturally within the transistor. The positive voltage attracts free-floating electrons within the body towards the gate, forming a conductive channel. But first, enough electrons must be attracted near the gate to counter the dopant ions added to the body of the FET; this forms a region free of mobile carriers called a [[depletion region]], and the phenomenon is referred to as the ''[[threshold voltage]]'' of the FET. Further gate-to-source voltage increase will attract even more electrons towards the gate which are able to create a conductive channel from source to drain; this process is called ''inversion''.

For either enhancement- or depletion-mode devices, at drain-to-source voltages much less than gate-to-source voltages, changing the gate voltage will alter the channel resistance, and drain current will be proportional to drain voltage (referenced to source voltage). In this mode the FET operates like a variable resistor and the FET is said to be operating in a ''linear mode'' or ''ohmic mode''.

If drain-to-source voltage is increased, this creates a significant asymmetrical change in the shape of the channel due to a gradient of voltage potential from source to drain. The shape of the inversion region becomes &quot;pinched-off&quot; near the drain end of the channel. If drain-to-source voltage is increased further, the pinch-off point of the channel begins to move away from the drain towards the source. The FET is said to be in ''saturation mode'';
The saturation mode, or the region between ohmic and saturation, is used when amplification is needed.  The in-between region is sometimes considered to be part of the ohmic or linear region, even where drain current is not approximately linear with drain voltage.

Even though the conductive channel formed by gate-to-source voltage no longer connects source to drain during saturation mode, [[Charge carriers|carriers]] are not blocked from flowing. Considering again an n-channel device, a [[depletion region]] exists in the p-type body, surrounding the conductive channel and drain and source regions. The electrons which comprise the channel are free to move out of the channel through the depletion region if attracted to the drain by drain-to-source voltage. The depletion region is free of carriers and has a resistance similar to [[silicon]]. Any increase of the drain-to-source voltage will increase the distance from drain to the pinch-off point, increasing resistance due to the depletion region proportionally to the applied drain-to-source voltage. This proportional change causes the drain-to-source current to remain relatively fixed independent of changes to the drain-to-source voltage and quite unlike the linear mode operation. Thus in saturation mode, the FET behaves as a [[current source|constant-current source]] rather than as a resistor and can be used most effectively as a voltage amplifier. In this case, the gate-to-source voltage determines the level of constant current through the channel.

MOSFET The '''metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor''' ('''MOSFET''', '''MOS-FET''', or '''MOS FET''') is a [[transistor]] used for amplifying or switching electronic [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signals]]. 

In MOSFETs, a voltage on the oxide-insulated gate electrode can induce a [[channel (transistor)|conducting channel]] between the two other contacts called source and drain. The channel can be of [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] or [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] (see article on [[semiconductor device]]s), and is accordingly called an nMOSFET or a pMOSFET (also commonly nMOS, pMOS). It is by far the most common [[transistor]] in both [[digital circuit|digital]] and analog circuits, though the [[bipolar junction transistor]] was at one time much more common.

* MOSFET Symbol

==Characteristics==
===MOSFET Construction===
: [[Image:FET_cross_section.png|200px]]

===MOSFET Operation===
The operation of a MOSFET can be separated into three different modes, depending on the voltages at the terminals. For the NMOSFET the modes are:

===Cut-off or sub-threshold mode=== 

When 

:&lt;math&gt;V_{GS} &lt; V_{T}&lt;/math&gt; 

where 

:&lt;math&gt;V_{T}&lt;/math&gt; is the threshold voltage of the device. 

Here the switch is turned off, and there is no conduction between drain and source.  While the current between drain and source should ideally be zero since the switch is turned off, there is a weak-inversion current, or subthreshold leakage.  With MOSFET scaling subthreshold leakage composes a large percentage of total power consumption.

===Triode or linear region===

When 

:&lt;math&gt;V_{GS} &gt; V_{T}&lt;/math&gt;

and 

:&lt;math&gt;V_{DS} &lt; V_{GS} - V_{T}&lt;/math&gt;

The switch is turned on, and a channel has been created which allows current to flow between the drain and source.  The MOSFET operates like a resistor, controlled by the gate voltage.  The current from drain to source is:

:&lt;math&gt;I_D \approx \frac{\mu_n C_{ox}}{2}\frac{W}{L}\bigg[2(V_{GS}-V_{T})V_{DS}-{V_{DS}}^2\bigg]&lt;/math&gt;

===Saturation===

When 

:&lt;math&gt;V_{GS} &gt; V_{T}&lt;/math&gt; 

and

:&lt;math&gt;V_{DS} &gt; V_{GS} - V_{T}&lt;/math&gt;


The switch is turned on, and a channel has been created which allows current to flow between the drain and source.  Since the drain voltage is higher than the gate voltage, a portion of the channel is turned off. The onset of this region is also known as pinch-off. In first approximation the drain current is now independent of the drain voltage, and the current is only controlled by the gate voltage:

:&lt;math&gt;I_D \approx \frac{\mu_n C_{ox}}{2}\frac{W}{L}(V_{GS}-V_{T})^2&lt;/math&gt;

In digital circuits the transistors are only operated in cut-off and saturation mode. The triode mode is mainly relevant for analog applications.

JFET stands for Junction Field Effect Transistor . There are two types type of JFET

==N-type JFET== 
Take a N-type silicon, cut two slots at its left and right and pop in P-type semiconductor in those slots. Whats results is a N-channel JFET. Ohmics contacts atr attached to the top and bottom and they serve as Drain and Source terminals. Ohmic contacts are attached to the P-type material too and they are both tied together and this is called as the gate.

==P-type JFET== 
P-Channel JFET has a similar construction where N and P regions of N-Channel JFET are swapped.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Matter==
Matter refers to any physical quantity that has shape, can be measured and has its own physical, chemical and Electrical properties 

===Physical Properties===
All matter exists in one of three states 
# [[Solid]] like an Ice cube
# [[Liquid]] like Water
# [[Gas]] like Water vapor . 

All matter has a mass M and a volume V . The ratio of Mass over Volume indicates the Density of Matter
:&lt;math&gt;D = \frac{M}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

where
:M, Mass measured in Kilogram kg
:V, Volume measured in Kilogram m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
:D, Density measured in Kilogram kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

===Chemical Properties===
All matters are made up from Chemical Element's Atom the smallest indivisible part made up Chemical Element . There are 128 Chemical Elements have been discovered . Each element has its own Atomic Number and Mass and properties listed in a table called Periodic Table
: m  
::E  
: z  

Where
:m, Mass
:E, Element
:z, Atomic number

===Sub Atomic Electric Charged Particles===
Further study of matter has shown that Atom is made up of sub-atomic particles that carries Electric Charge called [[Electric Charged Particles]] . There are three kinds of Charged Particles

[[Electron]] . Electron carries ''Negative Charge'' has a symbol ''e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;'' and a mass of ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;''

[[Proton]] . Proton carries ''Positive Charge'' has a symbol ''p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'' and a mass of ''m&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''

[[Neutron]] . Neutron carries ''No Charge'' has a symbol ''n&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;'' and a mass of ''m&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''

==Matter Model==
Since the discovery of Charged Particles, The smallest indivisible particles made up Matter Chemical Element Atom . There is a reason to believe that matters are made up from charged particles and so the Model of Matter has been developed

===Rutherford's Model===
In 19__, Rutherford propose a Model of Matter from charged particles Electron , Proton, Neutron . According to Ruther Ford's model,
# All matter has a Mass M a Volume V and a Density equals to the ratio of Mass over Volume exist in one three states Solid like Ice cube, Liquid like Water , Gas like Water vapor
# All matter made up from Charged Particles the smallest indivisible part still has matter's characteristics
# All matter has a Neucleus made of Proton and Neutron in the center and Electron's orbits circulating around the Neucleus 
# Number of electrons in the orbits must be equal to number of protons in the neucleus . Atomic number in the Periodic Table indicates number of Protons in the neucleus or the number of electrons in orbits.
# Only Electron in the outermost orbit can participate in reaction

===Bohr's Model===
In 19__, Bohr proposed that 
# Each electron's orbit has a quanta of energy correspond to an Energy Level Number n . 
# There are 4 Energy Level Number n = 1 ..4 .  n = 4 has the highest energy level . n = 1 has the hlowest energy level 
# When electron moves from High Energy Level to Low Energy Level Electron will emits Electromagnetic Light Wave 
# E&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; - E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = hf

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Electrostatic Charge==
Electrostatic refers to the process of matter becomes Electric Charge

===Electric Charge===
Normally all matter are neutral or have net Charge equal to zero . When an object lose or gain electron . Object becomes Positive Charge or Negative Charge . 
: Matter + e --&gt; [-]
: Matter - e --&gt; [+]

All Charges pocess a Quantity of Electric Charge called Electric Charge denoted as Q measured in Couloum (C) an Electric Field made of Electric Field Lines radiate outward or inward . For Negatively Charge, the Electric Field Lines radiates inward .  For Positively Charge, the Electric Field Lines radiates outward. Electric Field is denoted as E measured in N/C . 

: Negative Charge , -Q  . ---&gt; Negative Charge &lt;--- .
: Positive Charge , +Q .  &lt;--- Positive Charge ---&gt;

Charges interact with each other according to Coulomb's Law
: ''Like Charges repulse . Unlike Charges attract , Negative Charge attract Positive Charge ''

==Electricity==
Electricity is caused by interaction between Electric Charges . 

Electric exist when there is a difference in Charge's Quantities that creates Potential Difference in Electricity 
: mQ - nQ = (m-n) Q

When there different charges interact with each other example Nagative Charge attracts Poaitive Chrages creates Kinetic Energy in Electricity. 
: &lt;math&gt;F = k \frac{Q_+ Q_-}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===ElectroDynamic Force===
If there is a Electromotive Force that sets stationary charge to move in straight motion to cause a flow of charge called Current then the Electric Field can be calculated by Ampere's Law
: F = E Q
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{F}{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{Q}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

===Electromagnetomotive Force===
If there is a ElectroMagnetomotive Force that can change the direction of the moving charge perpendicular to the initial direction of moving charge such that Positive charge will moved up perpendicular to the initial direction and Negative Charge will move down perpendicular to the initial direction then Magnetic Field can be calculated by Lorenzt's Law
: &lt;math&gt;F = \pm B v Q&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;B = \frac{F}{v Q}&lt;/math&gt;

===ElectroMagnetic Force===
ElectroMagnetic Force is the total force acting on the moving charge equals to the sum of the Electromotive Force calculated by Ampere's Law plus the Magnetomotive Force calculated by Lorentz's Law. 
: &lt;math&gt;F = E Q \pm B v Q = Q ( E \pm v B )&lt;/math&gt;

==Matter and Electricity ==
:[[File:Band_gap_comparison.svg|400px]]

Matter that interact with Electricity is divided into three groups [[Conductor]],[[Non Conductor]],[[Semi Conductor]]  depends on the ease of how current flow in the matter

[[Conductor]] 
: All matter that allows current to flow with ease are called Conductor. For example all Metals like Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu) are used to make Conductor

[[Non Conductor]]  
: All matter that does not allow current to flow in it are called Non Conductor . For example Rubber

[[Semi Conductor]] 
: All matter that allows current to flow somewhere between conductor and non conductor are called Semi Conductor . For example Silicon (Si), Gemanium (Ge)

Normally, Charges in Conductor drift randomly . When an Electric Source is connected to a conductor, The Electric Force will exert a Pressure on the charges to force charges to move in straight line causing a [[Current]] inside the conductor . The Presure of the Electric Source is called [[Voltage]]

===Voltage=== 
Voltage is defined as The pressure of the Electricity Force to make charges in the conductor to move in straight line and calculated by the ratio of Work Done on an Electric Charge . Voltage is denoted as V measured in Volt v . 
: &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{W}{Q}&lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;1v = \frac{1J}{1C}&lt;/math&gt;

===Current=== 
Current is defined as number of electric charges flow through an area of conductor in a period of Time . Current is calculated by the ratio of Electric Charge on Time . Current is denoted as I measured in Ampere A
: &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{Q}{t}&lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;1A = \frac{1C}{1s}&lt;/math&gt;

===Energy===
Power is defined as Energy of a Work over Time. Power is calculated by the product of Voltage and Current . Power is denoted as P measured in Joule J or Volt Amp VA
: &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{W}{Q} \frac{Q}{t} = \frac{W}{t} = V I&lt;/math&gt;
: 1 J = 1v x 1A

===Conductance===
Conductance is defined as the ratio of Current over Voltage . Conductance is denoted as Y measured in Siemen 1 / Ω
: &lt;math&gt;Y = \frac{I}{V} &lt;/math&gt;  
: &lt;math&gt;1S = \frac{1A}{1V}&lt;/math&gt;

===Resistance===
''Resistance'' is defined as the ratio of Voltage over Current . Resistance is denoted as R measured in Ohm 
: &lt;math&gt;R = \frac{V}{I} &lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{1V}{1A}&lt;/math&gt;

==Resistance==
===Resistance &amp; Temperature===
It's been observed that ''Resistance of a conductor changes with change in Temperature ''
: R = Ro + nT For Conductor 
: R = Ro e&lt;sup&gt;nT&lt;/sup&gt; For Semi Conductor

===Resistance &amp; Electric Power Loss===
Also, ''When conductor of resistance R conducts current . Conductor releases Heat Energy into the surrounding result in loss of Electric Power Energy directly proportional to the resistance of the conductor''
: &lt;math&gt;P_R = I^2 R = \frac{V^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

==Energy Supply , Loss and Deliver==
The Energy supplies to the conductor
: &lt;math&gt;E_V = V I &lt;/math&gt;

The Energy loss as Dissipated Heat
: &lt;math&gt;E_R = I^2 R = \frac{V^2}{R}&lt;/math&gt; 

The Energy Delivered without loss
: &lt;math&gt;E_V = E_V - E_R&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;E_V = VI - I^2 R = I (V - IR)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;E_V = VI - \frac{V^2}{R} = V (I - \frac{V}{R})&lt;/math&gt;

==Energy transfer Efficiency==
The efficiecy of Power transmission can be calculated as the percentage of Real Power over the Supplied Power
: &lt;math&gt;n = \frac{E_o}{E_i}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;n = \frac{E_i Cos \theta}{E_i} = Cos \theta&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;n = \frac{V - IR}{V}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;n = \frac{I - \frac{V}{R}}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Evaluating Limits===

What is a limit?  A limit is a place on the graph that the function either does not touch or go past.
&lt;p&gt;When evaluating a limit we may have to factor sometimes in order to get &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;.  L is the point in which the function does not touch or go past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c}f(x)=L&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's start off with a rather simple limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 3} x^2 + x + 3&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;3^2 + 3 + 3 = 15&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;L = 15&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see what we did was just plug 3 into the function to get &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This doesn't always work.  This is easily shown in fractions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will show you two different ways to evaluate the limits.  The first is by factoring and the second is by using L'Hopital's rule.&lt;/p&gt;

===Evaluating Limits by Factoring===

This is a fairly simply concept, not something easily done.  It is especially hard if you have a hard time identifying how polynomials can be rewritten.

&lt;p&gt;'''Ex.1'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to -2} \frac{(x+2)^2}{x+2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This gives us &lt;math&gt;L = \frac {0}{0}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;center&gt;This is an indeterminate form.  This means we have to find some other way to evaluate the limit so we can get the correct &lt;i&gt;L&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's look at how &lt;math&gt;(x + 2)^2&lt;/math&gt; is factored&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By factoring we now get &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to -2} \frac {(x+2)(x+2)}{x+2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to -2} \frac {1*(x+2)}{1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;-2 + 2 = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;L = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Ex.2'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{x^2+2x-8}{x-2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac{2^2+2*2-8}{2-2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;= \frac{0}{0}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;center&gt;Once again this is an indeterminate form.  Let's see if we can use factoring to get and answer.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Factoring the polynomial &lt;math&gt;x^2+2x-8&lt;/math&gt; we find that it equals &lt;math&gt;(x-2)(x+4)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let's use the factored in the limit equation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 2} \frac{(x-2)(x+4)}{x-2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see the (x-2) will cancel each other out.  Leaving us with&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 2} x+4&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;2+4 = 6&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;L = 6&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This type evaluating limits will take some time, but with practice can be done quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

===L'Hopital's Rule===

This rule is my favorite way to solve limits with indeterminate form.

&lt;p&gt;This way is a bit more advanced so I will cover it briefly, but I will show some examples and the idea behind it.  This is probably something you will learn in Calculus II&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you have a limit that you have confirmed that is in indeterminate form you can use L'Hopital's Rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the rule&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} f(x) = \frac {0}{0}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac {\infty}{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac {\infty}{0}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{-\infty}{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac{\infty}{-\infty}&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\frac{-\infty}{-\infty}&lt;/math&gt; use L'Hopital's rule.  Which is &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} \frac {f^\prime(x)}{g^\prime(x)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Ex. 1'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 5} \frac {x^2-3x-10}{x-5}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac {5^2 - 3*5 - 10}{5-5} = \frac {0}{0}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we have identified that it is in an indeterminate form we use L'Hopital's rule&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 5} \frac {2x - 3}{1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;2*5 - 3 = 7&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;L = 7&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an extremely simplified form of how this rule is used.  It is a really nice way to solve limit problems that give you indeterminate forms.&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Strategies==

===Pure Strategies===
A (pure) strategy specifies how a player will react in all possible circumstances in which s/he may be called to act. The strategy &lt;math&gt;s_i&lt;/math&gt; maps from the set of information sets, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mathcal{H}}&lt;/math&gt; to the set of actions &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mathcal{A}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;s_i : \mathbf{\mathcal{H}} \rightarrow \mathbf{\mathcal{A}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; s_i(H) \in C(H) \;\forall\; H \in \mathbf{\mathcal{H}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; 
requiring the strategy to specify only feasible actions at each information set.&lt;br&gt;

====Cardinality of the Strategy Space====
A player with &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; information sets choosing from &lt;math&gt;b_k&lt;/math&gt; actions at each information set &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, the number of possible 

====Strategy Profiles====
A ''strategy profile'' &lt;math&gt; s= (s_1,\dots,s_I)&lt;/math&gt; specifies a collection of strategies for each player and may also be written 
&lt;math&gt;s=(s_i,s_{-i})&lt;/math&gt;

Throughout the following discussion the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mathbb{S}}_i&lt;/math&gt; represents the set of all pure strategies available to player &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and the set &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mathbb{S}}=\times_{i=1}^I\mathbf{\mathbb{S}}_i&lt;/math&gt; be the set of pure strategy profiles

===Randomized Strategies===
====Mixed Strategies====
The mixed strategy &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; assigns each pure strategy &lt;math&gt;s_i \in \mathbf{\mathbb{S}}&lt;/math&gt; a probability it will be played, &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\sigma_i : \mathbf{\mathbb{S}}_i \rightarrow [0,1]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; \sum_{s_i\in\mathbf{\mathbb{S}}_i}\sigma_i(s_i)=1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; requiring the probabilities assigned to the elements of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mathbb{S}}&lt;/math&gt; sum to one, &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a probability distribution function over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mathbb{S}}&lt;/math&gt;
====Mixed Extension====
A mixed extension, the simplex &lt;math&gt;\Delta(\mathbf{\mathbb{S}}_i)&lt;/math&gt;, denotes the space of all mixed strategies over a pure strategy set &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mathbb{S}}_i&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt;\Delta(\mathbf{\mathbb{S}}_i) = \left\{(\sigma_{1,i},\dots,\sigma_{M,i}): \sigma_{m,i} \geq 0 \;\forall\; m = 1,\dots,M\mbox{ and } \sum_{m=1}^M\sigma_{m,i} = 1\right\}&lt;/math&gt;
====Expected Utility====
Given a mixed strategy profile &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; the expected utility &lt;math&gt;E_{\sigma}[u_i(s)]&lt;/math&gt; maps from all possible outcomes to the real line. Intuitively, calculating expected utility requires weighting the uvtility associated with each pure strategy profile &lt;math&gt;u_i(s)&lt;/math&gt; by the probability each profile will be played,&lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt;E_{\sigma}[u_i(s)] = \sum_{s\in\mathbf{\mathbb{S}}}Pr(s)\cdot u_i(s)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The mixed profile &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; assigns probabilities to each pure strategy &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; implying&lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt;Pr(s) \equiv [\sigma_1(s_1)\cdot\sigma_w(s_2)\dots\cdot\sigma_I(s_I)] = \prod_{i=1}^I\sigma_i(s_i)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; Thus, the expected utility from &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt;E_{\sigma}[u_i(s)]=\sum_{s\in\mathbb{\mathbf{S}}}\left[ \left( \prod_{i=1}^I\sigma_i(s_i)\right)u_i(s) \right] &lt;/math&gt;
====Behavioral Strategy====
In lieu of randomizing over pure strategies, a randomized strategy may be written as a tuple of probability distributions over actions available at each information set. A ''behavioral strategy'' then, specifies &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\forall H\in\mathbf{\mathcal{H}} \mbox{ and action } a \in \mathbf{\mathcal{A}} \mbox{ a probability } \lambda_{i}(a, H) \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{a\in C(H)} \lambda(a,H) = 1 \;\forall\;H\in\mathbf{\mathcal{H}}&lt;/math&gt;
====Behavioral vs Mixed Strategies====
A key distinction between behavioral and mixed strategies ''when'' the randomization occurs during the course of play. In the case of mixed strategies, players randomize over the set of pure strategies ''prior to play''. For behavioral strategies, randomization occurs ''during the course of play''.  A ''behavior strategy mixture'' admits both types of randomization, allowing the specification of a mixed strategy over the space of all behavioral strategies, &lt;math&gt; \sigma_i &lt;/math&gt; which assigns positive probabilities to one or more (finite) behavioral strategies &lt;math&gt;(b_{1,i}, \dots, b_k)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Any game exhibiting ''perfect recall'' admits pairs of behavioral and mixed strategies which exhibit outcome (realization) equivalence, meaning each strategy produces the same probability distribution over outcomes. The probability distribution over outcomes implied by any mixed strategy also results from a (unique?) behavioral strategy.

      <comment>/* Installing TOR on EC2 */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">

It is simple to contribute to the TOR network by hosting a TOR node on your EC2 instant.  Starting from 2010, Amazon provides a free tier service for 1 year.  Since the node is under your control, it cannot be compromised like selling aggregate information.  You can also configure a totally private node for your own use with faster response, and also trouble free, totally anonymous website hosting.

The standard TOR client can also run on top of a VPN, adding another level of indirection.  But this does not contribute to the TOR network, or increase the speed of TOR for your own traffic.




==Installing TOR on EC2==
Firstly, start an EC2 instant as described in the VPN section.  In the security group, you have to add custom TCP, at port 8080.  Start an SSH terminal session as in the VPN section.

You have to add the software depository into the file .  You can use a text editor vi:

:sudo vi /etc/apt/sources.list

add the line (for Ubuntu 10.10):

:deb http://deb.torproject.org/torproject.org maverick main

Add the gpg key used to sign the packages:

:gpg --keyserver keys.gnupg.net --recv 886DDD89
:gpg --export A3C4F0F979CAA22CDBA8F512EE8CBC9E886DDD89 | sudo apt-key add -

Refresh your sources and install Tor:

:sudo apt-get update
:sudo apt-get install tor tor-geoipdb

==Configuring a TOR node==
Save the file /etc/tor/torrc:
:sudo mv /etc/tor/torrc /etc/tor/torrc.bak

Use an editor to create a /etc/tor/torrc file that contains:

:SocksPort 0
:ORPort 8080
:BridgeRelay 1
:Exitpolicy reject *:*
:PublishServerDescriptor 0
:BandwidthRate 300 KB
:BandwidthBurst 350 KB
:AccountingStart month 1 00:00
:AccountingMax 1 GB

This configuration is for a private node, a bridge, for your own use. Normally a TOR route has 3 nodes, the entry, intermediate, and exit node.  A bridge can only be used as an entry node.  

By default your node is a public node, and can be used as an exit node.  This exit policy will not allow being used as an exit node - a pure relay node so your node IP will only be used within the TOR network.

By default, a bridge node IP is not published, but the TOR network still collects them and issues them to public who request it via email.  The PublishServerDescriptor setting turns the node into a private bridge.

The last four lines are important if you allow public to use your node.  Currently EC2 allows 15 GB per month in the free tier.

TOR is started by:

:/usr/sbin/tor &amp;

From the response message you can see the IP of your node via self-test, and if the node is published or not.

==Installing the TOR client==
For unknown reasons I cannot install TOR in the client machine using the same procedure.  You can download one of the TOR binary bundles from [http://www.torproject.org The TOR Project].

Once you tested the default configuration successfully, you can use your own bridge via Vidalia.  In options&gt;network, check that your ISP blocks TOR.  Your add your bridge as:
:&lt;ip&gt;:8080

where &lt;ip&gt; is the IP you read when starting your TOR node in EC2, and basically is the IP part in the public DNS.  You can also read the fingerprint but that's not necessary.

Other than using as a bridge, you can also configure and use your own EC2 node as an entry or exit node.  You have to do it by setting options in the client torrc file.

In the server node at EC2, you give it a nickname in the torrc file:

:Nickname mynick

In the client torrc file you can specify to use your own TOR server:

:EntryNodes mynick
:StrictEntryNodes 1

or

:ExitNodes mynick
:StrictExitNodes 1

You can do both if you have two different nodes.  If the strict flag is not set, the use of the nodes is not mandatory.  Instead of using nicknames, you can also use the IP of the node or fingerprint, both are displayed when you start your TOR server.

      <comment>/* God is Love */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Christus Ravenna Mosaic.jpg|thumb|300px|Blessings Jesus Christ.]]
'''Christianity is a religion with many different sides. There are the mystics, politicians, missionaries and charitable [[w:Christian|Christians]]. The medieval Christians led bloody wars among themselves, made crusades against the Islam, exterminated indigenous peoples in the colonization, killed in witch hunts many innocent women and recorded themselves in the inquisition processes by particular cruelty. In the past christianity often was a religion of intolerance, although its founder [[w:Jesus|Jesus]] was an enlightened ([[w:Son of God|Son of God]]) and tought love and peace. If a peacefull religion gets connected with worldly power, it is a great danger that the goal of the religion changes. Instead of making all people happy religion becomes a tool to dominate other people. In today's world we can see many Christians return to values such as peace, love and tolerance.''' 


==Threefold Proof of God’s Existence==
[[File:Grabmal. Christus als guter Hirte 03.jpg|thumb|200px|The Good Shepherd. Father of all beings.
All-embracing love.]]
'''In [[w:Christianity|Christianity]], God is defined as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. From this point of view comes the threefold proof of God’s existence. The threefold proof is attained by bringing spirituality and science together into a cohesive harmony of concept.'''
 
1. '''[[w:God|God]] as the Father is the universe.''' 

---&gt; [[v:God and Quantum Physics|God and Quantum Physics (Wikiversity)]]
 
2. '''God as the Son is every enlightened being.''' 
 
3. '''God as the [[w:Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Spirit]] is the spiritual being that every sensitive being can sense around him or herself.''' This can be perceived as light, love, peace and bliss. With this power, enlightened and highly developed spiritual people can help others. The bible describes how Jesus poured Holy Spirit onto his disciples on Pentecost. He filled his followers with this Holy Spirit. The followers felt radiantly and divinely happy and radiated an aura of pure light.

==The Sermon on the Mount==
[[File:Bloch-SermonOnTheMount.jpg|thumb|200px|Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called the sons of God.]]
*&lt;big&gt;'''&quot;You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.' But I tell you, don't resist him who is evil; but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also. If anyone sues you to take away your coat, let him have your cloak also. Whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two. Give to him who asks you, and don't turn away him who desires to borrow from you.&quot; &quot;You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy. 'But I tell you, love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you.&quot;'''&lt;/big&gt;

*'''Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.'''
*'''Blessed are they who mourn, for they will be comforted.'''
*'''Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the land.'''
*'''Blessed are they who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be satisfied.'''
*'''Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.'''
*'''Blessed are the clean of heart, for they will see God.'''
*'''Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called children of God.'''
 
Jesus meant „poor“ in terms of the inner self, and not the outer self. Outer poverty does not lead automatically to inner happines. '''Those who let go of outer attachments, can simply exist and find a way to inner contentment in God.'''
 
Suffering in and of itself does not lead to happiness. However, '''those who can take suffering in their lives''' and raise themselves through spiritual exercises, can find solace in inner peace. Mourning can help to let go, but one should not allow the self to be overwhelmed by grief. Grief is not the center of life, rather inner peace.
 
Those who can greet their fellow beings with '''non-violence''' and placidity, can live in a relaxed and peaceful way and relinquish into a cosmic consciousness. Those who are at peace with all things, are at peace with themselves.
 
Justice means correctness in the Bible. To long for a correct life, means to '''long for a life in the light.''' Those who long for happiness and search for it in the right places will receive it one day, in the form of inner peace.
 
Those full of empathy, will feel with the cosmos. Those who love their enemies will experience inner harmony. Those who experience the center of their existence as a '''love for all other beings''' will be rewarded by God with an all-encompassing love, peace, and inner happiness.
 
To dissolve inner tension, '''exercises''' for the body are required (going, meditation) and exercises for the spirit (reading, thought exercises). Those who exercise spiritually every day will reach a lasting happiness one day. Then one day the meaning of God will be found.
 
Those who '''let go of the ego,''' come into the light. Without a sacrifice, the breakthrough to enlightenment cannot be made. Those who live according to these teachings and therefore experience difficulty in their daily lives, provide the basis for such a spiritual sacrifice. To let go in a spiritual manner is an art. Those who do not go about this the right way create inner tension and conflict. We should not sacrifice too little or too much. Those who go about this the right way will be rid of their inner conflict.
 
A '''peacemaker''' is a person who makes peace within the self and the world. Those who are enlightened can be called holy, a son or daughter of God. Those who live in peace radiate peace into the world.
 
'''The central message of Jesus’ Mount Sermon is that a person cannot serve two lords. He cannot  serve God (inner happiness) and money (the outer form of “happiness”). One has to decide for him or herself as to what form of happiness he or she will seek to attain. As a wise person, one must place the way of peace, serenity, love, and spiritual exercises as the central point of existence. In this way, he or she will one day find true happiness and live in the light.'''

==Is There a Hell?==
[[File:Hel (1889) by Johannes Gehrts.jpg|thumb|200px|German Goddess Hell (love) with her hound (power) and her serpent (enlightenment energy, happiness).]] 
The topic [[w:Hell|„hell“]] is hotly debated. Most people do not believe there is such a thing. The larger religions, however, emphasize its existence. In Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, and also in Buddhism, it is taught that there is a hell. '''How can we find out the truth regarding Hell?''' What do the people who can travel with their consciousness into the other side say about this? What do the enlightened have to say regarding Hell?
 
The exact meaning of the term „hell“ is also often discussed. In Buddhism and Hinduism, Hell is considered an plane of energy that exists between earth and paradise. '''The word “hell” is only another term for the astral world. This description can be confirmed with a look into the history of the word. The word “hel” was originally used to describe the afterlife. One meaning of this word was “to enshroud”. The afterworld is hidden from most people, and only reveals itself to clairvoyants.'''
 
When considering the term „hell“ from this perspective, as a thing merely hidden from view, it sounds much less threatening. '''To go to hell simply means to go to the afterlife. It is already a step up on an emotional level. The individual gets happier.''' When we look at death more closely, the individual loses the material body and all the suffering which goes with it. The individual loses sickness and bodily injury or handicap.
 
'''The afterlife reflects the tendencies one has in the material life on earth.''' Those who are addicted to some form of enjoyment, or are addicted to attaining more and more material belongings or riches, or are obsessed with rage, fear, or sadness, take these spiritual states with them into the afterlife. These beings are somewhat happier than they were on earth, but not by much. In principle, such individuals stay the same as they were before.
 
Christianity subscribed to heavily to the term „hell“ in the Middle Ages. From this hell, it was supposed that a realm of fear and torture existed. '''Christian priests used this angle of fear to motivate their followers to exercise their spirituality. Others used this fear to manipulate from a purely power- driven standpoint, devoid of spiritual gain.''' This was not just a traditional Christian problem, but also in religious systems such as Hinduism and Buddhism was the concept of a painful afterlife overstated.
 
This misuse of the term „hell“ should be pushed aside.''' A bit of nervousness regarding this concept is not such a bad thing as a motivator towards a more spiritual life, but fullblown fear is damaging to a spiritual worldview and hinders the development of a spiritual soul.''' Modern near-death research emphasizes light and not darkness. Most experiences with the other side are positive.


==Is There a Devil?==
[[File:Codex Gigas devil.jpg|thumb|200px|Poor devil. Lives only his ego.]] 
The Christian faith believed the [[w:Devil|Devil]] occupied Hell. '''The Christian image of the Devil was an evil demon who tortured poor souls in his domain.''' A ruling devil with many lower demons as his minions who tried to tempt the pious from their faith completed this image.
 
When we look closely at the [[w:Bible|Bible]], we see that the Devil is not discussed very often. Moses reported of a snake who lived in paradise and wound itself around a tree. '''The snake is the symbol for Kundalini energy in yoga. This snake winds itself around the tree of enlightenment, the middle energy canal. The snake embodies the wisdom of life in the energy of inner happiness.'''
 
The snake gave Eve an apple of paradise. The apple had a spherical shape. The sphere is a symbol of unity, of entirety. A person is whole in and of him or herself. He or she has reached a cosmic consciousness. The sphere is the cosmos, the God, in which the enlightened individual lives. 
 
The snake in the Bible is not the devil. Where then is the devil? Jesus spoke of demons. He exorcised demons, drove them out. '''Demons are souls with many negative characteristics. Generally speaking, good people have more good characteristics, bad people more bad characteristics.''' Good people become helpful spirits and bad people tend to be more evil-doing, problem causing ghosts.
 
Despite this tendency, there are still good points in bad people. They are only mislead. Sometimes bad people are considered devils of sorts, but they are not really. They are only poor, lost souls in need of help and guidance. This is exactly the case with malevolent spirits. '''There is no such thing as a real devil who is a manifestation of absolute evil. This is only a construction of the minds of some priests.'''
 
The Bible refers to a devil who came to Jesus as he sat for forty days in the desert and meditated. Shortly before Jesus came to enlightenment, the devil appeared to him. The devil wanted to stop him from destroying his ego and from attaining the point where he could stay in the light. Before the inner conflict within a person dissolve, they strengthen for a time. A strong feeling of aversion to a spiritual life appears and the worldly pleasures appear for a time to be more important than god. They appear as a large source of confusion and temptation.
 
With a little imagination, the devil can be imagined. One can see the ego as a sort of inner devil who stops one in the path towards enlightenment. '''However, this devil is not a being, but a part of the individual’s own self. This is a visualized ego conflict.''' In the Bible it is described with an image, a presence, but this is not to be taken literally.
 
In Buddhism, the devil is called [[w:Mara (demon)|Mara]]. Before he achieved enlightenment, Mara came to Buddha. Buddha reached his hand towards the earth, activated his root chakra, and rid himself of this ego conflict. Mara and his entire army of temptation disappeared. After Buddha triumphed, the light of enlightenment flowed within. With Jesus, it meant that angels came and served him, after he managed to overwhelm his ego.
 
 
==Reformation of the Church==
[[File:Ribalta-cena.jpg|thumb|200px|Communion. Become one with Jesus. Get his energy.]] 
Atheist: The Catholic Church has other ideas, unfortunately.
 
Yogi: '''The Catholic Church is partially stuck in the Middle Ages, in terms of their ideas and beliefs.''' They missed an opportunity to change with the times, which they should quickly rectify, otherwise there will only be atheists in the world. And that would be a real shame.
 
I believe in the Catholic Church. I have friends who are Catholic Christians. The way to fit Christian beliefs with current knowledge, is not as difficult as the Catholics believe. They already have many progressive thinkers. I refer to [[w:Bede Griffiths|Bede Griffiths]] (who was an undogmatic, enlightened master, and a Catholic priest in India),
[[w:David Steindl-Rast|David Steindl-Rast]], [[w:Frère Roger|Frere Roger]], [[w:Mother Teresa|Mother Teresa]] and [[w:Anthony the Great|Anthony the Great]] (the first Christian Yogi). 
 
'''Jesus was a teacher of enlightenment.''' The Roman emperor Constantine made Christianity the official religion, from which point it became a way to control the population, to use as a tool for power. The [[w:Second Vatican Council|Second Vatican Council]] (1963-1965) then made a big change in ideology from religion of oppression to a religion of love and peace. But remants of the past still hinder the Church’s ability to move forward into the future.
 
'''The Church needs to comprehend what is intended with the term God. God is not a person, rather a dimension of consciousness. God is a term from the experiences of the enlightened (the holy).''' The Bible didn’t fly down from heaven, rather it was developed by enlightened prophets. The real saints of the Catholic Church are the enlightened.
 
Father Ödön: I’ve been following the discussion for awhile. I’d just like to say that religion is important for salvation. Greetings from my Saxonian rectory, and I wish you a fulfilling life!


==God is Love==
[[File:Prayer Mother Mary.jpg|thumb|300px]]
Anna Franziska: I am a Christian, but I respect Muslims, Jews, Buddhists, and other religions.
 
Yogi: Thanks. '''We should all respect one another.'''
 
Atheist: You have your interpretation of the Bible, but I could imagine another just as well.
 
Yogi: '''Jesus gave humanity a new idea of God. God is a God of love according to Jesus. Most Christians believe in a God of love. We should defend ourselves against confused fanatics. They have the wrong idea about religion.'''
 
Agnostic: You mean God has something to do with love, but you cannot prove it.
 
Yogi: I can prove that. '''God is a term from the experiences of the enlightenment. When you live in God, you experience love. You live in the energy of peace, love, and happiness.''' God has everything to do with love.
 
Esther: God’s most important concern is love. “And so we know and rely on the love God has for us. God is love. Whoever lives in love lives in God, and God in him.”( John 4,16)
 
Nils: Thank you. That is exactly the way it is. '''God and enlightenment (holiness) are two sides of the same coin and the middle is love.'''
 
Agnostic: The Bible is a collection of myths.
 
Nils: That’s right. That’s how I see it as well. '''The old Testament is mostly a collection of myths. The myths serve as a description of the way to enlightenment.''' The new Testament, which is what Christianity is based on, is however not a collection of myths. '''The mountain sermon is the most important part of the new testament and is a direct indication of the way to go about the spiritual path. The statements made there fit according to the knowledge of many of today’s enlightened.'''

&lt;big&gt;'''---&gt; &quot;[[w:Mother Teresa|Mother Teresa:]] The fruit of calm is prayer. The fruit of prayer is belief. The fruit of belief is love. The fruit of love is service. The fruit of service is happiness.&quot;'''
 
In meditation, conflict and tension dissipate. When all conflict recedes, inner happiness remains. The human lives in God. He or she experiences God and believes in God. With God, love and goodness awaken. He or she would then like to help his suffering fellow beings. He or she remains in God when he lives from that point of inner calm, and for the good of all beings.&lt;/big&gt;

==Jesus as the One Way?==
[[File:Pietro Perugino 040.jpg|thumb|200px|Ego Sacrifice.]] 
Christian: Jesus Christ said: &quot;I am the way and the truth and life, no one comes to the Lord without me.&quot;
 
Yogi: This sentence has been misunderstood by many Christians. '''Jesus didn’t say that he was the only enlightened and the only way to God. If that were so, he would have denunciated spiritual masters such as Abraham, Moses, John the Baptists as false prophets.''' Jesus didn’t seek to start his own religion. He explained clearly “I did not come here to dissolve the teachings of Moses or other prophets, I am here to fulfill their teachings”.
 
'''Jesus saw himself as a person who had realized the laws and testaments of the Bible in his life. He wanted to take the Jewish people back to the original point of the Bible.''' He wanted them to practice spirituality. Many Jews had interpreted the teachings at the time in a dogmatic way and were missing the true point of these teachings.
 
'''Without enlightened teachers, every religion can become dogmatic. The task of the enlightened is to bring humans back to effective spiritual exercise. The words “I am the way” should be understood in this light. Every enlightened is a way to God.''' When we understand the words in that sense, then we can refer to the necessity of enlightened masters to effectively practice spirituality. The Desert Fathers (St. Anthony) had this principle and were therefore successful on their spiritual path. Later the Christian church has abandoned this principle incorrectly.  One can also understand this sentence, that one has to develop the qualities of an enlightened (Jesus, Buddha) to attain enlightenment. Personally, I can accept that every religion thinks its founder is the only true enlightened one. Scientifically and with respect to tolerance and religious freedom, we should honor all positive religions as paths to God.
 
'''Those who consider their religion as the one true religion, only serve to strengthen violence on earth.''' When we fail to stop this, there will always be faith driven wars. When a group of believers think they are the only ones who are right, they need to then slay their foes, those who believe otherwise in a physical or spiritual way. A too rigid interpretation of the sentence “I am the way” is incorrect. '''Every enlightened is a son or daughter of God. He or she embodies God consciousness. The Christians need to let go of the idea that Jesus was the only enlightened master. This idea is understandable from a psychological standpoint, but fully unacceptable in scientific terms.'''

==Practice and Grace==
[[File:Dosso Dossi 022.jpg|thumb|200px|Ascention. Practicing and grace will come.]]
Christian: We are saved through grace. Grace cannot be worked on.
 
Yogi: '''Enlightenment occurs through spiritual practice and [[w:Divine grace|grace]]. To reduce enlightenment to grace is a big mistake. It encourages spiritual laziness.''' One has to practice intensively if he or she wishes to get a life in God. The Dalai Lama teaches, „enlightenment is hard work.“ I can confirm that after twentytwo years living as a yogi. Grace is part of it, but laziness is not smiled upon by God. 

Jesus explained, “those who believe in me will go to heaven.” He meant a real and deep belief with that statement. The non-enlightened are not capable of total belief. The Dalai Lama has the “two hand” teaching. '''One hand is that of the student, and the other that of the master. Only when both hands work towards the goal, can the student be brought to the world of light.'''
 
Jesus Christ sat for forty days and nights in the desert. Than the angels of God came to him and served him. '''Those who wish to live in God must meditate. The [[w:Gospel of Thomas|Gospel of Thomas]] says “search for a place of calm.” [[w:Christian meditation|Meditation]] is the way to a godly life. The early Christian [[w:Desert Fathers|desert fathers]] meditated in the desert like Yogis.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">HOLE IN THE OZONE LAYER :               SATURDAY,09, April,2011

                                                        


what  is ozone layer:  Ozone(o3) layer is an atmospheric layer arround the earth above the stratosphere it is about 50 km above the Earth.

How it's formed:  Ozone layer is formed by the reaction between the Oxygen in the atmosphere and the Ultra Violet Rays from the Sun.

UV Rays ----------&gt;   O2  --------------&gt;  O  +  O
                                            i       i
                                           i       i

                                   O2 + O ------------------&gt;  O3  

                                    When the UV Rays from the Sun fall on the  O2 present in the atmosphere , the  O2 splits in to two  Oxygen atoms . These oxygen atoms again combines with the other O2 molecules present in the atmosphere to form Ozone layer.

                        Like this O2 molecules present in the atmosphere arround the Earth are converted in to O3 and form the Ozone layer arround the Earth.
                               
                                  In the begining Ozone layer first formed on one side of the Earth and then on the other side of the Earth.Like this complete Ozone layer arround the Earth is formed.

Again this ozone splits in to oxygen(O2)molecule and oxygen (O) atom by the UV Rays.
These Oxygen (O2) molecules split in to oxygen (O) atoms.and these oxygen (O) atoms then combine with oxygen (O2) molecules to form ozone (O3).like this the chain reaction goes on.

Therefore the process of ozone (O3) layer formation is a chain reaction and this process contineus until oxygen (O2)present in the atmosphere.

THEREFORE THE HOLE IN THE OZONE LAYER MAY NOT BE PRESENT.

BUT AS PER THE STUDIES BY THE SCIENTISTS THERE IS A HOLE IN THE OZONE LAYER.
 
                                                                                To be contneus ....</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Field Effect Transistor==
Field Effect Transistor is another type of transistor made from silicon material . The '''field-effect [[transistor]] (FET)''' relies on an [[electric field]] to control the shape and hence the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] of a [[channel (transistors)|channel]] of one type of [[charge carrier]] in a [[semiconductor]] material. FETs are sometimes called ''unipolar transistors'' to contrast their single-carrier-type operation with the dual-carrier-type operation of [[bipolar junction transistor|bipolar (junction) transistor]]s (BJT). The ''concept'' of the FET predates the BJT, though it was not physically implemented until ''after'' BJTs due to the limitations of semiconductor materials and the relative ease of manufacturing BJTs compared to FETs at the time.

For the symbols in which the bulk, or body, terminal is shown, it is here shown internally connected to the source. This is a typical configuration, but by no means the only important configuration. In general, the MOSFET is a four-terminal device, and in integrated circuits many of the MOSFETs share a body connection, not necessarily connected to the source terminals of all the transistors.

=== FET operation ===
[[Image:JFET n-channel en.svg|thumb|280px|I–V characteristics and output plot of a JFET n-channel transistor.]]

The FET controls the flow of [[electron]]s (or [[electron hole]]s) from the source to drain by  affecting the size and shape of a &quot;conductive channel&quot; created and influenced by voltage (or lack of voltage) applied across the gate and source terminals (For ease of discussion, this assumes body and source are connected). This conductive channel is the &quot;stream&quot; through which electrons flow from source to drain.

In an n-channel ''depletion-mode'' device, a negative gate-to-source voltage causes a ''[[Depletion zone|depletion region]]'' to expand in width and encroach on the channel from the sides, narrowing the channel. If the depletion region expands to completely close the channel, the resistance of the channel from source to drain becomes large, and the FET is effectively turned off like a switch. Likewise a positive gate-to-source voltage increases the channel size and allows electrons to flow easily.

Conversely,  in an n-channel ''enhancement-mode'' device, a positive gate-to-source voltage is necessary to create a conductive channel, since one does not exist naturally within the transistor. The positive voltage attracts free-floating electrons within the body towards the gate, forming a conductive channel. But first, enough electrons must be attracted near the gate to counter the dopant ions added to the body of the FET; this forms a region free of mobile carriers called a [[depletion region]], and the phenomenon is referred to as the ''[[threshold voltage]]'' of the FET. Further gate-to-source voltage increase will attract even more electrons towards the gate which are able to create a conductive channel from source to drain; this process is called ''inversion''.

For either enhancement- or depletion-mode devices, at drain-to-source voltages much less than gate-to-source voltages, changing the gate voltage will alter the channel resistance, and drain current will be proportional to drain voltage (referenced to source voltage). In this mode the FET operates like a variable resistor and the FET is said to be operating in a ''linear mode'' or ''ohmic mode''.

If drain-to-source voltage is increased, this creates a significant asymmetrical change in the shape of the channel due to a gradient of voltage potential from source to drain. The shape of the inversion region becomes &quot;pinched-off&quot; near the drain end of the channel. If drain-to-source voltage is increased further, the pinch-off point of the channel begins to move away from the drain towards the source. The FET is said to be in ''saturation mode'';
The saturation mode, or the region between ohmic and saturation, is used when amplification is needed.  The in-between region is sometimes considered to be part of the ohmic or linear region, even where drain current is not approximately linear with drain voltage.

Even though the conductive channel formed by gate-to-source voltage no longer connects source to drain during saturation mode, [[Charge carriers|carriers]] are not blocked from flowing. Considering again an n-channel device, a [[depletion region]] exists in the p-type body, surrounding the conductive channel and drain and source regions. The electrons which comprise the channel are free to move out of the channel through the depletion region if attracted to the drain by drain-to-source voltage. The depletion region is free of carriers and has a resistance similar to [[silicon]]. Any increase of the drain-to-source voltage will increase the distance from drain to the pinch-off point, increasing resistance due to the depletion region proportionally to the applied drain-to-source voltage. This proportional change causes the drain-to-source current to remain relatively fixed independent of changes to the drain-to-source voltage and quite unlike the linear mode operation. Thus in saturation mode, the FET behaves as a [[current source|constant-current source]] rather than as a resistor and can be used most effectively as a voltage amplifier. In this case, the gate-to-source voltage determines the level of constant current through the channel.

The '''metal–oxide–semiconductor field-effect transistor''' ('''MOSFET''', '''MOS-FET''', or '''MOS FET''') is a [[transistor]] used for amplifying or switching electronic [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signals]]. 

The basic principle of this kind of [[transistor]] was first proposed by [[Julius Edgar Lilienfeld]] in 1925. In MOSFETs, a voltage on the oxide-insulated gate electrode can induce a [[channel (transistor)|conducting channel]] between the two other contacts called source and drain. 

The channel can be of [[n-type semiconductor|n-type]] or [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] (see article on [[semiconductor device]]s), and is accordingly called an nMOSFET or a pMOSFET (also commonly nMOS, pMOS). It is by far the most common [[transistor]] in both [[digital circuit|digital]] and analog circuits, though the [[bipolar junction transistor]] was at one time much more common.

The 'metal' in the name is now often a [[misnomer]] because the previously metal gate material is now often a layer of [[polysilicon]] (polycrystalline silicon). [[Aluminium]] had been the gate material until the mid 1970s, when polysilicon became dominant, due to its capability to form [[self-aligned gate]]s. Metallic gates are regaining popularity, since it is difficult to increase the speed of operation of transistors without [[metal gate]]s.

IGFET is a related term meaning insulated-gate field-effect transistor, and is almost synonymous with MOSFET, though it can refer to FETs with a gate insulator that is not oxide. Another synonym is [[MISFET]] for metal–insulator–semiconductor FET.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As previously noted, the altitudes of any triangle ABC intersect at their orthocentre, H.

The orthocentres of the triangles ABH, BCH, ACH are respectively C, A and B.

The four triangles ABC, ABH, BCH and ACH have the same nine-point circle.  The four incircles and twelve excircles all touch this nine-point circle.

All four triangles have the same circumradius.

The reflection of H in any side of ABC lies on the circumcircle of ABC, and the same applies to each of the points A, B and C.

The centroids of the four triangles form a set of four points which is similar to the original set ABCH, but one third the size.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''convex function''' f('''x''') is a real-valued function defined over a convex set X in a vector space such that for any two points x, y in the set and for any &amp;lambda; with &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 0 \le \lambda \le 1,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f(\lambda x +(1-\lambda) y) \le \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda) f(y).&lt;/math&gt;

NB: Because X is convex, :&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle (\lambda x +(1-\lambda) y)&lt;/math&gt; must be in X.

If the function -f(x) is convex, f(x) is said to ba a '''concave function'''.  It is easily seen that if a function is both convex and concave, it must be linear.

'''Theorem:''' A convex function on X is bounded above on any compact subset of X.

'''Theorem:''' A convex function on X is continuous at each point of the interior of X.

'''Theorem:''' If f(x) is convex in a set containing the origin O, and f(O) = 0, then {{frac|f(&amp;mu;x)|&amp;mu;}} is an increasing function of &amp;mu; for &amp;mu; &gt; 0.

A '''thyristor''' is a [[Solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] [[semiconductor device]] with four layers of alternating [[N-type semiconductor|N]] and [[P-type semiconductor|P-type]] material. They act as [[bistable]] switches, conducting when their gate receives a current pulse, and continue to conduct while they are forward biased (that is, while the voltage across the device is not reversed).

[[File:Kennlinie DIAC.svg|right|thumb|Typical DIAC voltage and current relationships. V&lt;sub&gt;BO&lt;/sub&gt; - breakover voltage]]
[[File:Diac.svg|left|thumb|80px|DIAC]]
[[File:D3capas sym.PNG|left|thumb|80px|Three-layer DIAC]]
The '''DIAC''', or '[[diode]] for [[alternating current]]', is a diode that conducts [[Electrical current|current]] only after its breakover [[voltage]] has been reached momentarily. 

When this occurs, diode enters the region of [[negative dynamic resistance]], leading to a decrease in the voltage drop across the diode and, usually, a sharp increase in current through the diode. The diode remains &quot;in conduction&quot; until the current through it drops below a value characteristic for the device, called the holding current. Below this value, the diode switches back to its high-resistance (non-conducting) state. This behavior is bidirectional, meaning typically the same for both directions of current.

Most DIACs have a three-layer structure with breakover voltage around 30 V. In this way, their behavior is somewhat similar to (but much more precisely controlled and taking place at lower voltages than) a [[neon lamp]].

DIACs have no gate [[electrode]], unlike some other [[thyristor]]s that they are commonly used to trigger, such as [[TRIAC]]s. Some TRIACs, like [[Quadrac]], contain a built-in DIAC in series with the TRIAC's &quot;gate&quot; terminal for this purpose.

DIACs are also called ''symmetrical trigger diodes'' due to the symmetry of their characteristic curve. Because DIACs are bidirectional devices, their terminals are not labeled as ''anode'' and ''cathode'' but as A1 and A2 or MT1 (&quot;Main Terminal&quot;) and MT2.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Triac==
'''TRIAC''', from '''Triode for Alternating Current''', is a [[genericized tradename]] for an [[electronic component]] which can conduct [[electric current|current]] in either direction when it is triggered (turned on), and is formally called a '''bidirectional triode thyristor''' or '''bilateral triode thyristor'''.

A TRIAC is approximately equivalent to two complementary unilateral [[thyristor]]s (one is anode triggered and another is cathode triggered [[silicon-controlled rectifier|SCR]]) joined in [[Antiparallel (electronics)|inverse parallel]] (paralleled but with the polarity reversed) and with their gates connected together. It can be triggered by either a positive or a negative [[voltage]] being applied to its ''gate'' electrode (with respect to A1, otherwise known as MT1).  Once triggered, the device continues to conduct until the current through it drops below a certain threshold value, the [[Silicon controlled rectifier#Modes_of_operation|holding current]], such as at the end of a half-cycle of [[alternating current]] (AC) mains power. This makes the TRIAC a very convenient switch for AC circuits, allowing the control of very large power flows with [[Ampere|milliampere]]-scale control currents.  In addition, applying a trigger pulse at a controllable point in an AC cycle allows one to control the percentage of current that flows through the TRIAC to the load ([[phase control]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Voltage Regulators==
Voltage Regulators is an electronics device that has the capability to keep voltage at constant voltage level

==Configurations==
===Zener Diode Regulator===
: [[File:Zener_reg.gif|400px]]

=== Transistor regulator ===
: [[Image:Voltage stabiliser transistor.png|400px]]
In the simplest case [[emitter follower]] is used, the base of the regulating transistor is directly connected to the voltage reference:


The stabilizer uses the power source, having voltage U&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt; that may vary over time. It delivers the relatively constant voltage U&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;. The output load R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; can also vary over time. For such a device to work properly, the input voltage must be larger than the output voltage and Voltage drop must not exceed the limits of the transistor used.

The output voltage of the stabilizer is equal to U&lt;sub&gt;Z&lt;/sub&gt; - U&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt;  where U&lt;sub&gt;BE&lt;/sub&gt; is about 0.7v and depends on the load current. If the output voltage drops below that limit, this increases the voltage difference between the base and emitter (U&lt;sub&gt;be&lt;/sub&gt;), opening the transistor and delivering more current. Delivering more current through the same output [[resistor]] R&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; increases the voltage again.

=== Op Amp Regulator  ===
: [[Image:Voltage stabiliser OA.png|400px]]

The stability of the output voltage can be significantly increased by using an [[operational amplifier]]:

In this case, the operational amplifier drives the transistor with more current if the voltage at its inverting input drops below the output of the voltage reference at the non-inverting input. Using the [[Voltage divider rule|voltage divider]] (R1, R2 and R3) allows choice of the arbitrary output voltage between U&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; and U&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;.

This will be Black's last move.  He, in his hotheaded desire to take White's queen and develop his knight, has not seen the threat of [[Chess Opening Theory/1. e4/1...e5/2. Bc4/2...Bc5/3. Qh5/3...Nc6/4. Qxf7#|Qxf7#(Scholar's Mate)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Wikijunior Future''' is a book made to predict (guess) what will happen in the future

==How to predict the future==
Predicting the future is hard, because it is impossible to know what will happen in the future. But there are a lot of ways to tell what will happen in the future

===Trends===
One way of finding out what might happen in the future is to look at trends. Trends are patterns in information and facts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ceteris paribus==
This idea leads into another basic tenet of economics.  In any economic analysis, we usually assume that everything outside of the problem at hand remains constant.  For instance, some variables in our unemployment and inflation model will actually erase the tradeoff.  This happened in the 1980s and 1990s in the United States, where there was low unemployment and low inflation at the same time.  However, for the most part the model is almost always correct.  Thus, for the purposes of examining those two variables, economists usually assume that all of the other possible variables effecting those remain the same.  Economists call this '''ceteris paribus''' or the ''other things being equal assumption''.  When considering economics, it is helpful to first evaluate only two variables, and then to examine the effects of other upon the '''model'''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Methodology==
As a science, economics follows the ''scientific method''.  Hypotheses are developed from observations, and are tested to ensure validity (usually in economics this simply involves more observation).  For results to be valid, an hypothesis must be capable of predicting an outcome more than once.

Economists are usually involved in '''theoretical economics''' and use their observation of facts to interpret them in a meaningful way.  They use cause and effect relationships to establish '''economic theories''' or '''principles'''.  Over time, a theory or principle may become accepted as universally true, at which point it becomes a '''law'''.  A law is generally always considered to be true.  A caveat to all of this is that all economic theories, principles, and laws are generalizations or abstractions.  They simplify the actual picture, even more so because of ceteris paribus.  A law, though almost always true, may prove false under special circumstances.  Like other social sciences, economics cannot apply universal rules because humans sometimes act irrationally.

== Use of Models ==

Economists use models to portray situations. Hence, there is a focus on understanding how things work, observing patterns, and predicting results of stimuli. Keep in mind that models are theoretical and follow the rules of deductive logic.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Decision Making Under Uncertainty==

===Lotteries===
A ''simple lottery'' is a tuple &lt;math&gt;(p_1, \dots, p_N)&lt;/math&gt; assigning probabilities to N outcomes such that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^{N}p_k = 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

A ''compound lottery'' assigns probabilities &lt;math&gt;(\alpha_1,\dots,\alpha_K)&lt;/math&gt; to one or more simple lotteries &lt;math&gt; L_1, \dots, L_K&lt;/math&gt;

A ''reduced lottery'' may be calculated for any compound lottery, yielding a simple lottery which is ''outcome equivalent'' (produces the same probability distribution over outcomes) to the original compound lottery.

Consider a compound lottery over the lotteries &lt;math&gt;L_1,\dots,L_K&lt;/math&gt; each of which assigns probabilities &lt;math&gt;p_1,\dots,p_N&lt;/math&gt; to N outcomes. The compound lottery implies a probability distribution over the N outcomes which, for any outcome n, may be calculated as &lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=1}^K\alpha_k\cdot p_n^k&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt; In words, the probability of event n implied by a compound lottery is the probability of event n assigned by each lottery, weighted by the probability of a given lottery being chosen.

====Example====
Consider an outcome space &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10\}&lt;/math&gt;.  A (fair) six sided dice replicates the simple lottery &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{1}{6},\frac{1}{6},\frac{1}{6},\frac{1}{6},\frac{1}{6},\frac{1}{6},0,0,0,0 \right)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; and a (fair) ten sided dice replicates the simple lottery &lt;math&gt; \left(\frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{10}, \frac{1}{10}\right) &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Now imagine a person randomly draws a dice from an urn known to contain nine six sided dice and one ten sided dice. This draw represents a compound lottery defined over the outcome space. The probability of any outcome &lt;math&gt;\in [1,6] = \frac{9}{10}\cdot\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{10}\cdot\frac{1}{10} = \frac{16}{100}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; and the probability of an outcome &lt;math&gt;\in [7,10] = \frac{9}{10}\cdot 0 + \frac{1}{10}\cdot \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{100}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
Producing a reduced lottery, &lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{4}{25},\frac{4}{25},\frac{4}{25},\frac{4}{25},\frac{4}{25},\frac{4}{25}, \frac{1}{100},\frac{1}{100},\frac{1}{100},\frac{1}{100}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

===Preferences and Uncertain Outcomes===
Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\mathcal{Z}}&lt;/math&gt; represent a set of possible outcomes (consumption bundles, monetary payments, et cetera) with a space of compound lotteries &lt;math&gt; \Delta \mathbf{\mathcal{Z}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Indra deva.jpg|thumb|300px|Indra. God of War. War is intolerance. Make love not war!!]]
'''Hinduism consists of many different groups who worship different idols. In former times dominated the god of war and intolerance [[w:Indra|Indra]]. In the 6th Century BC, developed in India the [[w:Yoga|yoga]] movement. It taught tolerance, peace and universal love. The Neo-Hinduism is based on [[w:Ramakrishna|Ramakrishna]] and represents the unity of all religions. It is a way of toleration and love. All religions can be paths to God, when practiced correctly. Ramakrishnas disciple [[w:Swami Vivekananda|Vivekananda]] was a famous member of the first World Parliament of Religions in 1893 in Chicago.''' 

The best known representative of the Neo-Hinduism is [[w:Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Gandhi]]. Gandhi believed that at the core of every religion was truth and love (compassion, nonviolence and the Golden Rule). He also questioned what he saw as hypocrisy, malpractices, and dogma in all religions, including his own: ''&quot;Thus if I could not accept Christianity either as a perfect, or the greatest religion, neither was I then convinced of Hinduism being such. (...) What was the meaning of saying that the Vedas were the inspired Word of God? If they were inspired, why not also the Bible and the Koran?&quot;'' (The Story of My Experiments with Truth, autobiography of Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi)


==Patanjali (Yoga Sutra)==
[[File:Patanjali.jpg|thumb|200px|Patanjali Statue.]]
[[w:Patanjali|Patanjali]] is the father of Indian yoga. He lived in the second century BC. In the [[w:Yoga Sutra|Yoga Sutra]], he grasped the essence of all yoga knowledge together in a few words. The two main sets of Patanjali are, &quot;Yoga is the calming of the mind. Then the yogi lives in the light.&quot;

The way of peace by Patanjali is to calm the mind over the years on the spiritual path more and more, and finally to be able to live in peace. To soothe the thoughts Patanjali recommends a two-step way. The first stage is the development of positive ethic qualities (the ten yoga principles). The second stage of the yogic path is to practice [[w:Meditation|meditation]].

1.''' Non-violence ([[w:Ahimsa|ahimsa]])''' = No killing other beings. Be meek. Be peaceful. Be tolerant.

2. '''Truthfulness (Satya)''' = Live in the truth. Basically, be honest with yourself and others. A Yogi is silent in doubt . Those who consistently lives in the truth radiate truth. Their fellow men trust them.

3. '''Righteousness (Asteya)''' = Not stealing, not cheating. A Yogi is in professional life generally honest. He does not seek unwarranted advantage, but he is looking for fair trade. 

4. '''Wisdom (Brahmacharia)''' = Live in the spiritual focus (in the light/in God = Brahman). Do not serve the money (outer pleasure) but the inner happiness (enlightenment). Be centered in your inner happiness and peace.

5. '''Simplicity (Aparigraha)''' = Be moderate in external enjoyment and consumption. A spiritual person lives modestly outwardly and inwardly rich. A Yogi uses his energy not in outer actions, but lives so peaceful that it turns inward and cleanse his body from the inside. One day, he lives permanently in the light (the cosmos energy).

6.''' Worship of the spiritual goal (Ishvara-Pranidhana)''' = Thus we do not lose our spiritual path, it is necessary that we remind ourselves again and again to our spiritual goal. We can worship an image (Goddess, Shiva), we can bow before a statue or speak a mantra (prayer). Send light to all beings, and wish a happy world.

7. '''Sacrifice the ego (Shaucha)''' = The way into the light passes through the crucifixion of the ego. Without a crucifixion there is no enlightenment. True sacrifice is an art. He who sacrifices too much braced themselves internally. Who sacrifices too little, does not solves his tentions. How do you get inner peace today? &quot;I let go of my false desires. I take things as they are.&quot;

8. '''Selfdiscipline (Tapas)''' = A clear goal, a clear life plan and a clear way of practicing. Tapas means to lead a disciplined life. Follow your inner wisdom and you'll win on your spiritual path.

9.''' Reading (Svadhyaya)''' = The daily reading (mantra, meditation) keeps us on the spiritual path, cleanses our spirit, connects us with the enlightened masters and makes us to spiritual victors. 

10. '''Contentment (Santosha)''' = Satisfied with what one has. Get into the satisfaction with yourself and your life? &quot;My thought of satisfaction is now ...&quot;


==God in Hinduism==
[[File:Brahma sarawati.jpg|thumb|200px|Brahma (person) in Brahman (cosmos).]]
'''God in Hinduism is called [[w:Brahman|&quot;Brahman&quot;]]. Brahman is the universe, the father and mother of all beings. Brahman is the highest dimension in the cosmos. Brahman is around and within all beings. To live in Brahman means to live in the light.''' Brahman can be realized through sat-chit-ananda, a life in peace (existence), unity and love to all beings. '''The many [[w:Hindu deities|Gods and Goddess in Hinduism]] are role models to awaken the enlightenment energy.''' The most important Gods are [[w:Vishnu|Vishnu]] (the god of love) and [[w:Shiva|Shiva]] (the god of yoga). [[w:Brahma|Brahma]] is the god who represents the cosmic consciousness. With his four heads he visualizes the whole universe (all four directions together). Thus he becomes one with Brahman (cosmic consciousness).

[[w:Sivananda Saraswati|Swami Sivananda]] wrote of Brahman: ''&quot;He who has realized Brahman, becomes quiet. The supreme reality is absolute joy. Rise up step by step to the transcendent experience where all names and forms disappear and only the pleasure of God exists. Divine grace is the greatest treasure in life. Ignorance exists as long as egoism is available. Egoism is the great confusion. God is the source of all happiness. All beings are in him. God is pure spirit. God is the way and the goal. Remember that God is always with you, in you and around you. Then you will get much power, inner peace and inner happiness.&quot;'' (Swami Sivananda, &quot;Sadhana&quot;, Page 404 f.)

==The Yogi Bhagiratha==
[[File:Ravi Varma-Descent of Ganga.jpg|thumb|200px|Shiva gets his energy from the Goddess and than gives it to his people.]]
[[w:Bhagiratha|Bhagiratha]] was an Indian king. '''All his brothers and sisters lived in the hell. They lived in the world of suffering. They were inwardly unhappy. They were tormented by the seven demons anger, pride, envy, greed, fear, addiction and unwisdom.'''

Bhagiratha knew that his brothers and sisters could not recover by themselves from their spiritual unwisdom. '''The path of inner happiness is hard to understand. The consistent spiritual practice is difficult to learn. And still more difficult it is the way of effective practicing to be found.''' Most people lose themselves in the formal practice and do not come forward. Without an enlightened master is not easy for a normal man to come into the light successfully. 

'''Bhagiratha decided to save his brothers and sisters from the hell. He became a yogi and brought first himself into the light.''' After having practiced twelve years intense yoga meditation, one night Lord Shiva appeared in his dream and asked him what he wants. Bhagiratha replied: &quot;I want to free my brothers and sisters from hell. I want to bring all people of the world into the light of God. I wish a happy world full of happy people. &quot;

Shiva then opened the sky and let the water of life flowing down on the earth. The impact on the earth was so great that Shiva had to soften it. He let the water run through his matted Yogihaar, and it was spread on the ground in many small streams. The streams splashing from the Himalaya mountains into the Indian plains and irrigated the land. '''All India began to flourish, the people were happy and the animals were happy too.''' The result was the sacred river Ganges, which supplies today northern India with water.

'''Bhagiratha transformed into Shiva.''' The water is the cosmic energy (kundalini-energy). The energy flowed inside and outside over his head and his hairs down on his body. After some time Bhagiratha was quite full of energy and happiness, surrounded by a cloud of light. Where he stepped his feet, the earth started to bloom. Red roses and white lilies lined his path. Near him the wild animals were tame, and the birds began to sing.

'''When he looked like a God (Buddha/Shiva), beaming with happiness, he went back into the world of suffering (in yoga the material world can be called &quot;hell&quot;) and told his people from the way of inner happiness.''' As he himself had achieved this, they believed him and followed him. All his brothers and sisters practiced every day the spiritual path. They practiced yoga, meditation and positiv thinking. They went the way of the consistently positive relationships. They lived their relations not from the ego, but from God (the light inside). Thus, the Paradise was brought to earth.

'''The story of Bhagiratha is the connecting link between yoga, buddhism and christianity. It is the way of love to enlightenment (holiness, living in the light, in bliss).''' The essence of this three religions is to be happy and to be good. Love yourself (God within you) and realize your inner happiness. Love all beings of the world and realize a cosmic consciousness. Be a spiritual father and mother of all unenlightened beings. Help them on their spiritual way and built up a happy world. This ist the way to enlightenment, inner healing and holiness.

Practice selfrealisation and universal love in balance. Give yourself the relaxation, rest and joy you need. '''Don´t think only of yourself. Concern for your fellow beings. Only we all together can built up a happy world. We are one family und have to help each other. That is the essence from the story of Bhagiratha.'''


==Shiva Meditation==
[[File:Bangalore Shiva.jpg|thumb|300px|Shiva meditating.]]
'''Shiva is the supreme God in Yoga. We can see him as the symbol of a victorious yogi. Shiva has a cosmic consciousness. He lives above the world of duality. He lives in the light (sat-chit-ananda, peace-unity-bliss).'''  

Shiva as cosmic consciousness can occur in many forms. The most famous incarnations of Shiva are the meditator, the blessing (the karma yogi), the ego sacrificer (subordinated under the goddess Kali) and the dancer with the life (Nataraja). Shiva is the master of life. He lives his life with the five features of love (earth), joy (air), wisdom (water), strength (fire) and resting (space, cosmos). He lives at the right moment the right property.

1. The Winner = We shake the fists near our head and think: '''&quot;I am a winner. I reach my goal. ... My goal is....&quot;'''

2. The Strong = We rub the feet on the ground and visualize the Mount Meru among us, '''&quot;I'm sitting on the Mount Meru (Himalaya Mountains). I maintain equanimity in pain. I'm going with perseverance my way.&quot;'''

3. The Egoless = We make large circles with our hands around us, visualize the cosmos full of stars and think, '''&quot;I live in the great system of the cosmos (nature). I take things the way they are.&quot;'''

4. The Hatha-Yogi = We visualize within ourselves the Kundalini Serpent, twist in the spine, move our toes and think: '''&quot;I am a Hatha Yogi. I save myself with my spiritual exercises.&quot;'''

5. The Karma-Yogi = Shiva means &quot;The Good&quot;. He works for the goal of a happy world. We move our hand, send all beings light and think, '''&quot;I send light to... May all beings be happy. May the world be happy.&quot;''' 

6. Master Yoga = We rub the palms before our heart chakra, visualize the sky above us and think, '''&quot;Om all enlightened Masters. Om inner widom. Please guide and help on my way.&quot;'''

7. Shiva Picture = Concentrate on a picture or a statue of Shiva. Move one hand and take the energy from Shiva. Think several times the mantra '''&quot;Om Namah Shivaya&quot;''' (I connect myself with Shiva) or '''&quot;Shivo Ham&quot;''' (I am Shiva) and feel how the energy of Shiva flows with the mantra in you.

8. Meditation = We put our hands in the lap, move your toes and think one minute the mantra '''&quot;Om Shanti&quot;''' (inner peace) in the belly. Then we stop a minute every thought. We spend some time relaxing in meditation and then come back. '''We are Shiva. We are a positiv dancer with the live. We go wise and optimistic our way.'''

==1. Describe the national, state or provincial, AY, Pathfinder, and Christian flags.==

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
|[[File:Flag of Antigua and Barbuda.svg|thumb|300px|'''National Flag:''' The 7 point golden sun of the Antigua &amp; Barbuda flag represents the dawn of a new era. The colour red represents the life blood of slave forefathers and the dynamism of the people. Blue represents hope. Black represents, the soil and African heritage. The gold, blue &amp; white represent Antigua's and Barbuda's tourist attractions; sun, sea and sand. The &quot;V&quot; formed by the red borders represent: &quot;Victory at last.&quot;]]
|[[Image:Pathfinderflag.jpg|thumb|300px|'''Pathfinder Flag:''' The Pathfinder flag is made from one of several materials,   cotton bunting, rayon, or nylon. The flag is divided through the center both vertically and horizontally making four equal parts. The background colors are royal blue and white alternately sewed together with the upper left hand comer being royal blue. The Pathfinder emblem is centered in the heart of the background. The colors are descriptive of the purposes and ideals of Pathfindering. White means purity, blue means loyalty, red reminds us of the shed blood of Christ (sacrifice), and gold means excellence. The symbols also have meanings. The shield is the protection of God, the sword is his word, the Bible, and the triangle represents completeness. Completeness of the Godhead (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit), and completeness of the three parts of education (Mental, Physical, and Spiritual).]]
|-
|[[Image:Ayflag.jpg|thumb|300px|'''AY Flag:''' The background is red and white, red symbolizing the blood of Christ and white representing purity. In the center, there is a logo that has AY which means Adventist Youth and it has three angels meaning the 3 angels message.]]
|[[Image:Christian_flag.svg|thumb|300px|'''Christian Flag:''' The &quot;Christian Flag&quot; is a white flag with a blue canton and a red cross in it. It was designed by Charles Overton in 1897 to represent Protestants of all denominations.  The cross symbolizes the crucifixion of Christ.]]
|}

==2. Know how to display the national flag with two other flags under the following situations: &lt;br&gt;a. Camp out/camporee &lt;br&gt;b. Fair &lt;br&gt;c. Pathfinder Day program &lt;br&gt;d. Parade==

==3. Demonstrate how to fold and salute your national flag. Mention when and how it should be displayed. ==
===Folding ===
     
# Have two people stand on either end of the flag, holding a corner in each hand. 
# Fold the flag in half twice, length-wise. 
# Beginning at the red end, fold one corner into the opposite side of the flag, forming a triangle. 
# Repeat this triangular folding until only the top edge of the flag shows. 
# Tuck this end into the triangle. 

Be sure to keep the flag from touching the ground while folding.



===Flag Protocol=== 
Some countries have added certain protocols into their law system while others prefer to have &quot;guidelines&quot; without civil or criminal consequences attached.

;'''General guidelines:
General guidelines are accepted practically universally.

Much of the flag protocol is derived from common sense. That is, using it as a table cover or wrapping paper are inappropriate uses. It should be treated with respect. Many countries consider signing a flag disrespectful, adding a border would be more appropriate. Pinning or sewing items to a flag would also be ill advised.

;On a mast or pole:
The flag of honor, that is the nation's flag in most cases, is flown on the center mast if possible. It is also correct to fly the flag on its own right. To an observer it would be on the far left. If more than three flags are used, the proper position is as far left from the point of view of an observer. An additional flag may be placed on the right side, but is not necessary.

When two poles are crossed, the position of honor is the flag that ends on the left side from the point of view of an observer (the pole will therefore end on the right).

In a semicircle, the position of honor is the center. If a full circle is used outside an entrance to an arena or stadium, the position of honor is directly opposite the entrance. If used to line the walls of the arena, the flag should be placed directly opposite the entrance.

;Hanging:
When flown horizontally, as from a flag pole, the flag should be oriented so that the canton is closest to the top of the pole. If hung against a wall, the canton should be placed in the upper-left corner from the point of view of the observer.

When hung vertically, flags should be rotated so the canton is again closest to the top of the pole. If the flag is displayed against a wall, the canton should again appear in the upper-left corner, which incidentally requires that the flag be both rotated and 'flipped' from its horizontal orientation.

;Other places:
On a vehicle the flag should be affixed securely to the front right of the chassis.

When placed with a podium or at a place of worship the flag should be hang directly behind or on a pole to the right of the speaker, from the point of view of the audience.

When carried in single file the flag of honor leads.

;Multiple flags:
When flags of many nations are flown the flag of the hosting country should be placed on the left with the rest following in alphabetical order using the language of the host country.

==4. Explain the meaning of and reason for the National Anthem, and recite the words from memory. ==




===The National Anthem of Antigua and Barbuda    “Fair Antigua and Barbuda.” ===

It was written by Novelle Hamilton Richards. Its music was composed by Walter Garnet Picart Chambers. 
Upon achieving statehood in the commonwealth in 1967, Antigua adopted the anthem &quot;Fair Antigua, We Salute Thee&quot;,
which has the same melody as the current anthem however with somewhat different lyrics. When full independence 
was granted in 1981, Antigua, now linked with Barbuda, adopted the current lyrics with the melody in use since 1967. It has three verses that represent the People’s Pledge of commitment, Call to duty and Prayer to God.

===Antigua &amp; Barbuda National Anthem===

&lt;poem&gt;
'''Verse One'''

''Fair Antigua and Barbuda ''
''We thy sons and daughters stand,''
''Strong and firm in peace or danger ''
''To safe guard our native land.''
''We commit ourselves to building ''
''A true nation brave and free. ''
''Ever striving ever seeking ''
''Dwell in love and unity.''

'''Verse Two'''

''Raise the standard! Raise it boldly! ''
''Answer now to duty's call''
''To the service of thy country, ''
''Sparing nothing, giving all;''
''Gird your loins and join the battle ''
'' 'Gainst fear, hate and poverty, ''
''Each endeavouring, all achieving, ''
''Live in peace where man is free. ''

         
'''Verse Three'''

''God of nations, let Thy blessings ''
''Fall upon this land of ours; ''
''Rain and sunshine ever sending,'' 
''Fill her fields with crops and flowers; ''
''We her children do implore Thee, ''
''Give us strength, faith, loyalty, ''
''Never failing, all enduring ''
''To defend her liberty.''
&lt;/poem&gt;

==5. Give the rights and responsibilities of a citizen of your country. ==

===Rights===
Every person in Antigua and Barbuda is entitled to the fundamental rights and freedoms of the individual, that is to say, the right, regardless of race, place of origin, political opinions or affiliations, colour, creed or sex, but subject to respect for the rights and freedoms of others and for the public interest. The citizens have the right to fully participate in the political system of the twin island nation. They have the right to change their government. Each citizen is entitled to free education and good health. Here are some of the rights enjoy by an Antiguan and Barbudan citizen:

*a.	Freedom of Personal Integrity
*b.	Freedom of Speech 
*c.	Freedom of Press
*d.	Freedom of Peaceful Assembly and Association
*e.	Freedom of Religion
*f.	Freedom of Movement

===Responsibilities===
Each citizen of Antigua and Barbuda has the responsibilities to protect the rights and freedom of self but also that of his/her fellow citizens. He/she is responsible to respect the public’s interest. These are to include protection of one’s life, one’s conscience, one’s expression and one’s property. Each member of the working public are required to pay deductions according to salary scale.

==6. Have an interview with a local, regional, or national official of your country, and learn about his duties. ==
It is generally easier to get a local official to agree to an interview, though it is often more exciting to interview a more prominent person.  The interview can be accomplished during a club meeting, and multiple Pathfinders can ask questions.  Invite your guest well ahead of time, and make sure everyone in the club is on time.  A visit by an official would be a very good reason to have everyone in the club wear their class A uniforms.  If desired, you can make up several questions ahead of time, writing them on index cards, and distributing them to the members of your club.  But do not be so rigid as to not allow them to ask spontaneous questions.  Having questions prepared ahead of time on index cards are a good way to get things rolling.  Here are some suggested questions:
* Could you describe a typical day at work?
* What is the most difficult part of your job?
* What is the most satisfying aspect of your job?
* To whom do you report?
* How did you get your position?  Were you elected, appointed, or hired?
* How should a young person prepare for a life of public service?

==7. Write a one-page essay or give a two-minute oral report about a famous person in your country. Mention what he has done to gain his recognition. ==
This would be an excellent opportunity to present a worship during the opening exercises of a regular club meeting.  Encourage your Pathfinder to choose a person they are personally interested in.  If they cannot think of anyone themselves, have a list of suggested persons at hand and encourage them to choose from the list.  Famous people might be historical figures, politicians, actors, sports stars, or anyone else.  It would be preferable to choose a person who has been a positive influence on the country.

Although the requirement asks that you &quot;mention what ''he'' has done to gain ''his'' recognition,&quot; this should not be interpreted as excluding women.  Men are not the ''only'' famous people in a country.

Note that just because the requirement suggests that the famous person should be male (''his'' recognition), the Pathfinder should in no way feel constrained to limit the selection to just men.

==8. Do one of the following: ==
===a. Make a list of ten famous quotations from leaders of your country.===

===b. Make a list of ten famous historic places in your country. ===

===c. Make a list of ten famous historic events in your country.===

==9. Describe what you can do as a citizen to help your church and country. ==
The best way to help either your church or your country is by ''getting involved''.  Edmund Burke, an English philosopher summed this up when he said ''&quot;The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.&quot;''

In your church, this means that you will show up for services on a regular basis.  It also means you will support it with your tithes and offering, show up for business meetings, and not wait to be asked before you volunteer your services.  If you see something that needs done, ''do it.''  If you do not have the skill to do it, or you think that you need permission first, talk to your pastor, an elder, deacon, or deaconess.  Find your ministry!

For your country, it is much the same.  Show up for public meetings, stay informed about the issues of the day, vote if you are eligible, and pay your taxes fairly and promptly.

==10. Go through the steps of an individual acquiring citizenship in the country and learn how this is done. ==

==11. Know how to explain the process of government in your country. ==

==12. Explain the meaning of this statement Jesus made in Matthew 22:21: &quot;Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's. ==
This verse teaches that governmental authority is to be respected, as long as it does not conflict with the moral obligations of being a Christian.  Government serves a holy purpose; preserving social order, promoting the well-being of its citizens, and protecting their safety.  If you believe that this does not apply today because you see the government as corrupt, you are urged to research the Roman government of the first century A.D. when these words were spoken by Jesus.  Was Herod corrupt?  Was Pilate just?

==13. Explain why laws are established in your country. ==

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{mbox|type=delete|text=This book is out of scope for Wikibooks.  Please add your terminology to [[wikt:|Wiktionary]].  [[WB:DICT|Wikibooks is not a dictionary]].}}
This is a dictionary of word used in Pencak Silat and other martial arts in Indonesia and Malaysia.


= Why This Dictionary =

'''Why a dictionary ?'''

Indonesian archipelago as the source of Pencak Silat consist of many tribes which uses different language and different dialect. Pencak Silat as an umbrella term for this region traditional martial arts brought different words from different language and dialect. Some school even have different definition for the same word use by others.

Therefore, a dictionary for the term used by practitioner of Pencak Silat and other martial arts in the region is needed as a bridged introduction to these arts.


'''Why not an encyclopedia?'''

Most of history in Malaysia and Indonesia is transmitted by oral. They are rarely written and thus, some claims are heavily disputed. Thus, instead of having a detail of explanation of a topic as what an encyclopedia does, a dictionary of words would probably more appropriate.


'''Why include ‘other Malaysian and Indonesian Traditional Martial Arts’?'''

Because, there are other martial arts came from this region and they didn’t want to be considered as Pencak or Silat. For example, Benjang from West Java, Timbang from West Java, and Mepantigan from Bali.


'''Why include ‘Malaysian’?'''

First of all, please do not be a chauvinist. While most of Pencak Silat came from Indonesia, Malaysia have their proud of Silat. Indonesia shared a lot of culture with Malaysia, and fight over it is futile if not stupid.


'''Why not include South Thailand (Pattani) and Philippines?'''

Because they rarely speak Malay. Indonesian, although each ethnic have their own language,  speak Indonesian Language as a first language and the language is based on Malay language. Malaysian, well, they have ‘Malay’ in their country names.

Well, okay, you can put some word from Pattani and South Philipines related to Pencak Silat or any traditional martial arts.


'''Why not using Wiktionary?'''

Because the entry will be spread among pages and topics in Wiktionary while this dictionary is meant to collect those related word.

= The Style of Dictionary =

The word being defined is in bold, followed by a bold-italic word represent the type of word whether they are noun, verb, or adjective. Then, an italic word surrounded by bracket for the region or the school where the word come from.

For example:

* '''rasa''' '''''n''''' ''(Indonesia, Malay)'' sense, feeling
* '''lihiak''' '''''n''''' ''(Minang)'' neck
* '''cikalong''' '''''n''''' ''(place)'' A region in Cianjur, West Java

= The Type of Word can be Included in This Dictionary  =

# a common word related to the martial art like a word to describe ‘fast’, ‘stance’, ‘low’, or anatomy part like ‘hand’ or ‘groin’;
# a location;
# a fighting system;
# school name;
# a movement name;


= What This Dictionary Is Not =

# This dictionary is not a place to claim something which may provoke others. Do not define your school as ‘the only school who learn the original and the pure teaching of this person’;
# This dictionary is not a place to dispute a claim. If you see an outrageous claim, do not delete, do not fight. Edit the claim to have a neutral tone.
# This dictionary is not a place for promotion. If you open or join a school which teach Pencak Silat, put your school name here perhaps is not a good idea unless it have some degree of notability for example, the school have been opened in a long time. It is a subjective things but please be considerate when you put a school on this dictionary.
# This dictionary is not an encyclopedia. It may have a long definition. It may give some example. It may have pictures. But please keep it short and concise.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Betawi''' '''''n''''' ''(Indonesia)'' An ethnic group inhabit Jakarta. 

There are two opinion how this ethnic group came. The first one conclude Betawi came from a mix between Dutch's slaves from different ethnics while another one believed there had been a group of Melayu living in Jakarta, separated from Sundanese, and they assimilated the other ethnics to their group. The first opinion was popularized by Lance Castle while the latter held by Ridwan Saidi.

Their culture is rich by influenced of other ethnics lived in Jakarta in colonial era, notably Chinese, Arab, India, Portuguese, Dutch, Java and Sunda. Their silat systems also influenced by the fighting systems of those ethnics.

      <comment>/* A Positive Multicultural Coexistence */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Dcp7323-Edirne-Eski Camii Allah green3.svg|thumb|200px|Allah means God in Arabic.]]
'''In fact, the world is multicultural. To create a happy world, we need a tolerant coexistence of all religions. An important precursor is the [[w:Parliament of the World's Religions|World Parliament of Religions]]. It is seeking a peaceful and constructive coexistence of all religions. The big question is whether a nonviolent and tolerant Islam after the Qur'an is possible.''' 

'''The western  television is dominated by images of violent [[w:Islamism|Islamists]]. In the reality however the vast majority of [[w:Muslim|Muslims]] practise their religion peacefully. The [[w:Qur'an|Qur'an]] himself is a mystical book with many pictorial stories and vague statements. It needs to be interpretated and interpretations can be numerous. There are many different groups in Islam. There is no authority that gives a generally binding interpretation for all Muslims.'''


==Violence and Islam==
[[File:FirstSurahKoran.jpg|thumb|100px|First Surah Qur'an.]]
*[[w:Islam|Islam]] is a monotheistic religion articulated by the Qur'an, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God (Arabic: Allah), and by the Prophet of Islam Muhammad's teachings and normative example. Muslims believe that God is one and that the purpose of life is to worship God.
*While all Muslims believe that they are on the pathway to God and hope to become close to God in Paradise— after death and after the &quot;Final Judgment&quot;— [[w:Sufism|Sufis]] also believe that it is possible to draw closer to God and to more fully embrace the Divine Presence in this life.
*[[w:Criticism_of_Islam|Islam critics]] see the Islam as a violent religion and argue with the Islamic concept of [[w:Jihad|jihad]]. As further evidence of the alleged potential of violence Islam critics often refer on the military activities of Muhammad. 
*Political scientist and avowed Muslim [[w:Bassam Tibi|Prof. Bassam Tibi]] wants to develop a pluralistic Islam, ''&quot;Islam has to accept the fundamentals of cultural modernity (democracy, individual human rights, civil society, pluralism).&quot;'' ( [http://print.perlentaucher.de/artikel/3764.html Bassam Tibi: ''Der Euro-Islam.''])

==Many Interpretations of the Qur'an are possible==
[[File:Whirling Dervishes 2.JPG|thumb|200px|Whirling Dervishes.]]
Read the Qur'an and the [[w:Hadith|hadith]]. Think about the various branches of Islam. Try to understand the deeper meaning of religion. All true religions do lead to God. God is primarily a transcendent experience of the religion's founder. Through spiritual exercises, he has come in contact with a higher cosmic consciousness. This consciousness is described personal by some religions (as a person) and  unpersonal by other religions (as a higher dimension, truth, love, peace or light). '''Religions can be misused by power politics. Then it is not about to create peace, love and happiness inside the people, but to make bigger the ego of a religious leader or secular ruler. Realize that all religions did wrong, some more and some less.'''

---&gt; [[God and Religious Toleration/What is God]]

==The Way to God is Love, Peace and Happiness==
[[File:Muslim girls at Istiqlal Mosque jakarta.png|thumb|200px|Muslim girls.]]
The aim of a religion can be described as holiness, living in God or to get the paradise after death. '''Paradise is a place of love and peace. A person must develop a consciousness of love and peace so that he can rise after his death into the peaceful and loveful areas of the beyond.''' Ask yourself which interpretation of the Qur'an in this context is right.
*''&quot;If anyone harms (others), God will harm him, and if anyone shows hostility to others, God will show hostility to him.&quot;'' Sunan of Abu-Dawood, Hadith 1625. 

---&gt; [[v:A World of Peace, Love and Happiness|A World of Peace, Love and Happiness (Wikiversity)]]

==Multicultural Coexistence==
[[File:Mosque.jpg|thumb|200px|Faithful praying towards Makkah.]]
Support the tolerance in our society and defend us against intolerance.  Get involved for a world of love, peace and happiness. We are one human family. We have to live peaceful and tolerant together, to build up a happy world. '''Islam is a peaceful religion, if we interpret the Qur'an correctly.''' May the world be happy. May all people be happy. May we all live in love, peace and truth together.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Calculus/Top Nav|Formal Definition of the Limit|Limits/Exercises}}
Now that we have the formal definition of a limit, we can set about proving some of the properties we stated earlier in this chapter about limits.

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Constant Rule for Limits '''&lt;br/&gt;
:If ''b'' and ''c'' are constants then &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to c} b = b&lt;/math&gt;.}}
'''Proof of the Constant Rule for Limits:'''&lt;br/&gt;
To prove that &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to c} f(x) = b&lt;/math&gt;, we need to find a &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left|b-b\right|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\left|b-b\right|=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\left|b-b\right|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; is satisfied independent of any value of &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;; that is, we can choose any &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; we like and the &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; condition holds.

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Identity Rule for Limits '''&lt;br/&gt;
:If ''c'' is a constant then &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to c} x = c&lt;/math&gt;.}}
'''Proof of the Identity Rule for Limits:'''&lt;br/&gt;
To prove that &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to c} x = c&lt;/math&gt;, we need to find a &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.  Choosing &lt;math&gt;\delta=\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; satisfies this condition.

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Scalar Product Rule for Limits '''&lt;br/&gt;
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} f(x) =L&lt;/math&gt; for finite &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is constant. Then &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to c} k f(x) = k \cdot \lim_{x\to c} f(x) =  k L &lt;/math&gt;}}
'''Proof of the Scalar Product Rule for Limits:'''&lt;br/&gt;
Since we are given that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} f(x) =L&lt;/math&gt;, there must be some function, call it &lt;math&gt;\delta_{f}(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, such that for every &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left|f(x)-L\right|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta_{f}(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;.  Now we need to find a &lt;math&gt;\delta_{kf}(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left|k f(x)-k L\right|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta_{kf}(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
First let's suppose that &lt;math&gt;k&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\left|k f(x)-k L\right| = k \left|f(x)-L\right|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\left|f(x)-L\right|&lt;\varepsilon/k&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case, letting &lt;math&gt;\delta_{kf}(\varepsilon)=\delta_{f}(\varepsilon/k)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the limit condition.&lt;br/&gt;
Now suppose that &lt;math&gt;k=0&lt;/math&gt;.  Since &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; has a limit at &lt;math&gt;x=c&lt;/math&gt;, we know from the definition of a limit that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is defined in an open interval ''D'' that contains &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; (except maybe at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; itself).  In particular, we know that &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; doesn't blow up to infinity within ''D'' (except maybe at &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;, but that won't affect the limit), so that &lt;math&gt; 0 f(x)=0&lt;/math&gt; in ''D''.  Since &lt;math&gt;k f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the constant function &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; in ''D'', the limit &lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to c} k f(x) = 0&lt;/math&gt; by the Constant Rule for Limits.&lt;br/&gt;
Finally, suppose that &lt;math&gt;k&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;\left|k f(x)-k L\right| = -k \left|f(x)-L\right|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\left|f(x)-L\right|&lt;-\varepsilon/k&lt;/math&gt;.  In this case, letting &lt;math&gt;\delta_{kf}(\varepsilon)=\delta_{f}(-\varepsilon/k)&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the limit condition.

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Sum Rule for Limits '''&lt;br/&gt;
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} f(x) =L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} g(x) =M&lt;/math&gt;. Then
&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to c} [f(x) + g(x)] = \lim_{x\to c} f(x) +  \lim_{x\to c} g(x) =  L + M &lt;/math&gt;}}
'''Proof of the Sum Rule for Limits:'''&lt;br/&gt;
Since we are given that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} f(x) =L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} g(x) =M&lt;/math&gt;, there must be functions, call them &lt;math&gt;\delta_{f}(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta_{g}(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, such that for all &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\left|f(x)-L\right|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta_{f}(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;, and .&lt;math&gt;\left|g(x)-M\right|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta_{g}(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
Adding the two inequalities gives &lt;math&gt;\left|f(x)-L\right| + \left|g(x)-M\right| &lt; 2\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;.  By the triangle inequality we have &lt;math&gt;\left|f(x)-L\right| + \left|g(x)-M\right| \geq \left|(f(x)-L)+(g(x)-M)\right|=\left|(f(x)+g(x))-(L+M)\right|&lt;/math&gt;, so we have &lt;math&gt;\left|(f(x)+g(x))-(L+M)\right|&lt;2\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta_{f}(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta_{g}(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;.  Let &lt;math&gt;\delta_{fg}(\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt; be the smaller of &lt;math&gt;\delta_{f}(\varepsilon/2)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\delta_{g}(\varepsilon/2)&lt;/math&gt;.  Then this &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; satisfies the definition of a limit for &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} [f(x) + g(x)]&lt;/math&gt; having limit &lt;math&gt; L + M &lt;/math&gt;.

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Difference Rule for Limits '''&lt;br/&gt;
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} f(x) =L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} g(x) =M&lt;/math&gt;. Then
&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to c} [f(x) - g(x)] = \lim_{x\to c} f(x) -  \lim_{x\to c} g(x) =  L - M &lt;/math&gt;}}
'''Proof of the Difference Rule for Limits:
Define &lt;math&gt;h(x)=-g(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  By the Scalar Product Rule for Limits, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}h(x)=-M&lt;/math&gt;.  Then by the Sum Rule for Limits, &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}(f(x)-g(x))=\lim_{x\to c}(f(x)+h(x))=L-M&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; be any positive number. The assumptions imply the existence of the positive numbers &lt;math&gt;\delta_{1}, \delta_{2}, \delta_{3}&lt;/math&gt; such that&lt;br/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;(1)\qquad\left|f(x)-L\right|&lt;\frac{\varepsilon}{2(1+\left|M\right|)}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta_{1}&lt;/math&gt;

According to the condition (3) we see that
:&lt;math&gt;\left|g(x)\right|=\left|g(x)-M+M\right|\leq\left|g(x)-M\right|+\left|M\right|&lt;1+\left|M\right|&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta_{3}&lt;/math&gt;
Supposing then that &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\min\{\delta_{1},\delta_{2},\delta_{3}\}&lt;/math&gt; and using (1) and (2) we obtain
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\left|f(x)g(x)-LM\right|&amp;=\left|f(x)g(x)-Lg(x)+Lg(x)-LM\right|\\
&amp;\leq\left|f(x)g(x)-Lg(x)\right|+\left|Lg(x)-LM\right|\\
&amp;=\left|g(x)\right|\cdot\left|f(x)-L\right|+\left|L\right|\cdot\left|g(x)-M\right|\\
&amp;&lt;(1+\left|M\right|)\frac{\varepsilon}{2(1+\left|M\right|)}+(1+\left|L\right|)\frac{\varepsilon}{2(1+\left|L\right|)}\\
&amp;=\varepsilon

{{Calculus/Def|text= '''Quotient Rule for Limits '''&lt;br/&gt;
Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} f(x) =L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c} g(x) =M&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M \neq 0&lt;/math&gt;. Then
&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x\to c} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac{\lim_{x\to c} f(x)}{\lim_{x\to c} g(x)} = \frac{L}{M} &lt;/math&gt;
}}
'''Proof of the Quotient Rule for Limits:'''&lt;br/&gt;
If we can show that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{1}{g(x)}=\frac{1}{M}&lt;/math&gt;, then we can define a function, &lt;math&gt;h(x)&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;h(x)=\frac{1}{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; and appeal to the Product Rule for Limits to prove the theorem.  So we just need to prove that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x\to c}\frac{1}{g(x)}=\frac{1}{M}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; be any positive number. The assumptions imply the existence of the positive numbers &lt;math&gt;\delta_{1}, \delta_{2}&lt;/math&gt; such that&lt;br/&gt;

According to the condition (2) we see that
:&lt;math&gt;\left|g(x)\right|=\left|g(x)-M+M\right|\leq\left|g(x)-M\right|+\left|M\right|&lt;1+\left|M\right|&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta_{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Supposing then that &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\min\{\delta_{1},\delta_{2}\}&lt;/math&gt; and using (1) and (3) we obtain

'''Proof of the Squeeze Theorem:'''&lt;br/&gt;
From the assumptions, we know that there exists a &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\left|g(x)-L\right|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\left|h(x)-L\right|&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
These inequalities are equivalent to &lt;math&gt;L-\varepsilon&lt;g(x)&lt;L+\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L-\varepsilon&lt;h(x)&lt;L+\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
Using what we know about the relative ordering of &lt;math&gt;f(x), g(x)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;h(x)&lt;/math&gt;, we have&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;L-\varepsilon&lt;g(x)&lt;f(x)&lt;h(x)&lt;L+\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
or&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;-\varepsilon&lt;g(x)-L&lt;f(x)-L&lt;h(x)-L&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
So&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left|f(x)-L\right|&lt;max(\left|g(x)-L\right|,\left|h(x)-L\right|)&lt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;0&lt;\left|x-c\right|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
Telecommunication applications such as telephone, Internet and mobile phone have moved the society into the “Information Era” and changed the way people live. The widespread use of telecommunication applications provides significant benefit for both government and individual users. On the other hand, travel patterns are continuously changing throughout human history from carriage to automobile and from railway to the jet plane. As a matter of fact, telecommunication and transportation have some mutual attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia L. Moktarian. A Typology of Relationships between telecommunication and transportation. Transportation Research Vol. 24A, No. 3, pp. 231-242, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Both of their purpose is to transport something between origins and destinations. Transportation transports physical objects such as people and goods, while telecommunication transports information by radio waves. Sometimes, the aim of passenger transportation is to conduct some communication at the trip destination. In this sense, transportation sometimes also transports information. As a result, relationships between telecommunication and transportation arose a lot of attention in the past 30 years. The current interest &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Emerging Travel Patterns:  Do Telecommunications Make a Difference?&quot;, by Patricia L. Mokhtarian and Ilan Salomon.  Invited resource paper for the 8th Meeting of the International Association for Travel Behaviour Research, Austin, TX, September 21-25, 1997.  Chapter 7 in:  In Perpetual Motion:  Travel Behaviour Research Opportunities and Application Challenges, Hani S. Mahmassani, ed., Pergamon Press/Elsevier, 2002, 143-182.&lt;/ref&gt;is focusing on two trends: the cost of travel and the functionality of telecommunication in distributing information resources.

== Relationships between telecommunication and transportation ==
Salomon&lt;ref&gt;Ilan Salomon. Telecommunications and travel: substitution or modified mobility?. Journal of Transport Economics and Policy. 1985. 19(3), 219-235.&lt;/ref&gt; identified four types of relationships between telecommunication and transportation: substitution, complementarity, modification and neutrality. Substitution assumes that the more telecommunication technologies developed and spread, the less will be the demand for travel. On the other hand, complementarity means increase in the use of telecommunication will stimulate travel demand. Substitution and complementarity are two basic types of interactions between telecommunication and transportation systems. There are other two derived relationships: modification and neutrality mean people adjust their travel schedule because of telecommunication and there is no direct relationship between these two systems respectively.

== Scale of Study ==
Research studies focused on the relationship between telecommunication and transportation can be roughly divided into two classes in terms of scale: aggregate (macroscopic) and disaggregate (microscopic) levels. Different empirical studies have different findings that some conclude the potential relationship is substitution while others claim complementarity.

=== Disaggregated level ===
For disaggregated level, most studies only focus on specific telecommunication applications such as teleconferencing&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Lyon Mokhtarian. An Empirical Evaluation of the Travel Impacts of Teleconferencing&quot;. Transportation Research A 22A(4), 1988, 283-289.&lt;/ref&gt;, telecommuting&lt;ref&gt;Kimberly Wells, Frank Douma, Hannes Loimer, Laura Olson, and Cynthia Pansing. Telecommuting Implications for Travel Behavior Case Studies from Minnesota. Transportation Research Record 1752. 2001. pp. 148-156&lt;/ref&gt; and teleshopping&lt;ref&gt;Sangho Choo, Taihyeong Lee, and Patricia L. Mokhtarian. Do Transportation and Communications Tend to Be Substitutes, Complements, or Neither? U.S. Consumer Expenditures Perspective, 1984–2002. Transportation Research Record No. 2010, D.C., 2007, pp. 121–132.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== Teleconferencing and telecommuting ====
Teleconference includes telephone conference, video conference and web conference etc. Popular software for personal use includes Skype, Google Talk, Windows Live Messenger and Yahoo Messenger. The ability of teleconferencing to reduce travel is a very popular notion although research shows that the substitution effect is not obvious. Telecommuting means working at home or other remote location, with connections to a central office. It attracts the most research attention because telecommuting can reduce commuting trips which causes urban congestion. Technically speaking, a great portion of work situations can be easily carried out through telecommunications. However, work still needs face-to-face communications because work also involves social and psychological gratification.

==== Teleshopping ====
Conventional shopping requires people to go to the supermarkets, shopping centers and shopping malls, outlets in person. Teleshopping can be considered as non-store shopping where telematics are involved to obtain information or purchase consumer goods. Teleshopping  includes shopping channels on cable TV, Internet shopping (not necessary to be goods, but also music, software) From a vendor’s perspective, it is called electronic commerce. However, conventional store shopping still have a lot of attributes that teleshopping doesn’t. For example, the interaction between the customer and salespeople, bargain, opportunity to be outside the home or work environment etc. 

==== Telephone and mobile phone ====
Telephone and mobile phone are most popular telecommunication applications. Different research found different relationships between travel and telephone/mobile phone use. For example, Yim (1994)&lt;ref&gt;Yim, Y. The effects of mobile telephones on transportation and urban form. Paper presented at the 33rd Annual Meeting of the Western Regional Science Association, Tucson Arizona, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; studied the role of mobile phone in daily travel in the Bay area. 14.8% in 7347 mobile phone user reported driving less often after getting a cell phone and only 8% reported driving more often. On the other hand, a research done by Yim (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Yim, Y. Telecommunications and travel behavior: Would cellular communications generate more trips? Paper presented at the Transportation Research Board Annual Meeting. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; 6 years later concluded that mobile phone generated more trips rather than substituting for them.

Although disaggregated approach could provide detailed human behaviors, it is only limited in terms of activities it can capture mainly due to the data for disaggregated research are collected from survey or questionnaires which can’t reflect the whole picture in certain extent (Choo et.al, 2007). In addition, those surveys are restricted to relatively small and homogeneous samples.

=== Aggregated level ===
Aggregated level of studies reflects the travel behaviors of larger population over multiple telecommunication applications.
* Travel demand vs. telecommunication demand
It is assumed that they have a bi-directional relationship. Transportation demand has impact on the telecommunication demand. Some telecommunication products and services are directly targeted to transportation use such as vehicle-GPS, and Internet service on planes. On the other hand, telecommunication applications greatly impact travel demand: telecommuting, teleconferencing, teleshopping, telebanking, tele-entertainment etc. 
* Transportation supply vs. telecommunication supply
It is hypothesized that the transportation infrastructure and telecommunication infrastructure have potential relationships. For example, Internet optical fiber networks are superimposed on existing transportation network such as streets and subway heavily. Embedding the telecommunication infrastructure into the transportation network could reduce the cost of the telecommunication infrastructure. Telecommunication can increase the level of service of a transportation system by improving the efficiency of the network. The obvious example is the Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). The applications of ITS include probe car data collection, sensing technologies (ramp metering, SMART signal), video vehicle detection (Autoscope), HOT (High occupancy toll) lane etc. 
The relationship between transportation demand/supply and telecommunication demand/supply could be expressed in the following figure:

[[File:Telecom transportation relationship.png|400px|center|Relationship between telecommunication and transportation]]

In addition to the demand and supply (infrastructure), cost is also related to both demand and supply. Generally speaking, the relationship among demand, supply and cost can be described as a positive feedback loop. That is, when demand increases, the supply will increase which results in a decreasing cost. Then a decreasing cost stimulates the demand again. This trend applies to both telecommunication and transportation system. Economic activity (eg. GPS) and social-demographic (eg. population) also influence all demand, cost and supply in both networks.

== Transportation network and telecommunication network ==
From the network structure and traffic flow point of view, transportation network and telecommunication network also have some similarities.

=== Flow density relationship === 
Take computer network as an example. First of all, in computer networks, there exists a similar ‘fundamental diagram’ as in transportation network.

[[File:Flow density in computer network.png|400px|center|Flow density relationship in both computer network and transportation network]]

This figure shows the flow-density relationship in both networks. When density is low, flow will increase as density increases in a linear relationship. When density increases above a threshold, the flow will decrease sharply as density continue increases. We call it congestion in both networks when density is high. In transportation network, density can be thought as the number of cars in a certain length of freeway/arterial. In computer network, density can be considered as the number of packets sent by host A to host B within a certain route.

=== Circuit switching v.s. packet switching ===
Basically there are two routing techniques in computer network: circuit switching and packet switching. Figure 5 shows how circuit switching works. In circuit switching, a static route is established between the origin (Device A) and destination (Device B) before transferring data. All the demand between A and B will be assigned to this particular route. This technique is similar with the deterministic traffic assignment problem in which we do all or nothing assignment for each O-D pair after the shortest path of each O_D pair is calculated. The advantage of circuit switching is the quality of service is guaranteed for a particular O-D pair. The disadvantage is the static routing may not utilize the network efficiently.
On the other hand, packet switching (Figure 6) divided flow between Device A and Device B into small packets. Each packet will choose its route dynamically, meaning when the packet reaches the next node, it will choose its route again based on the current network condition. This feature is very similar to dynamic traffic assignment problems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==
A counter is a device that generates some patterned binary value depending on a clock or some other pulsed input. There are three simple types of counters ripple and synchronous.[[

==Types of Counters==
===Ring Counters===
If the output of a shift register is fed back to the input. a ring counter results. The data pattern contained within the shift register will recirculate as long as clock pulses are applied. For example, the data pattern will repeat every four clock pulses in the figure below. However, we must load a data pattern. All 0's or all 1's doesn't count. Is a continuous logic level from such a condition useful?


[http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/04375.png]


We make provisions for loading data into the parallel-in/ serial-out shift register configured as a ring counter below. Any random pattern may be loaded. The most generally useful pattern is a single 1.


[http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/04429.png]


Loading binary 1000 into the ring counter, above, prior to shifting yields a viewable pattern. The data pattern for a single stage repeats every four clock pulses in our 4-stage example. The waveforms for all four stages look the same, except for the one clock time delay from one stage to the next. See figure below.


[http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/04430.png]


The circuit above is a divide by 4 counter. Comparing the clock input to any one of the outputs, shows a frequency ratio of 4:1. How may stages would we need for a divide by 10 ring counter? Ten stages would recirculate the 1 every 10 clock pulses.


[http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/04431.png]


An alternate method of initializing the ring counter to 1000 is shown above. The shift waveforms are identical to those above, repeating every fourth clock pulse. The requirement for initialization is a disadvantage of the ring counter over a conventional counter. At a minimum, it must be initialized at power-up since there is no way to predict what state flip-flops will power up in. In theory, initialization should never be required again. In actual practice, the flip-flops could eventually be corrupted by noise, destroying the data pattern. A &quot;self correcting&quot; counter, like a conventional synchronous binary counter would be more reliable.


[http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/04432.png]


The above binary synchronous counter needs only two stages, but requires decoder gates. The ring counter had more stages, but was self decoding, saving the decode gates above. Another disadvantage of the ring counter is that it is not &quot;self starting&quot;. If we need the decoded outputs, the ring counter looks attractive, in particular, if most of the logic is in a single shift register package. If not, the conventional binary counter is less complex without the decoder.


[http://sub.allaboutcircuits.com/images/04433.png]


The waveforms decoded from the synchronous binary counter are identical to the previous ring counter waveforms. The counter sequence is (QA QB) = (00 01 10 11).

===Ripple Counters===
Ripple counters are the simplest type of counters. They are nothing more than toggle flip flops connected in a chain to divide each others output frequency by two. The result is a binary count. They are called ripple counters because the new count ripples through them. The major disadvantage of ripple counters is that because of new count &quot;rippling&quot; through the flip flops all the bits of the count arrive at different times.

===Synchronous Counters===
Synchronous counters are simple state machines made out of flip flops and logic gates. They have two parts, a register made out of flip flops and a decoder made out of logic gates. A register is a simple group of flip flops that are all clocked at the same time. In this way they can hold the counters output value until the next clock cycle. The decoder, decodes the current count and generates the correct value for the next count to the flop flops. For example in a simple up counter the decoder would always output the current count plus one. The major advantage of Synchronous Counters is that all the bits of their output change at the same time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Logic NAND==
NAND gates are one of the two basic logic gates (the other being NOR logic) from which any other logic gates can be built. Due to this property, NAND and NOR gates are sometimes called &quot;universal gates&quot;. However, modern integrated circuits are not constructed exclusively from a single type of gate. Instead, EDA tools are used to convert the description of a logical circuit to a netlist of complex gates (standard cells) or transistors (full custo] approach).

==NOT==
A NOT gate is made by joining the inputs of a NAND gate. Since a NAND gate is equivalent to an AND gate followed by a NOT gate, joining the inputs of a NAND gate leaves only the NOT part.

==AND==
An AND gate is made by following a NAND gate with a NOT gate as shown below. This gives a NOT NAND, i.e. AND.

|}

==OR==
If the truth table for a NAND gate is examined or by applying [[A-level Computing/AQA/Computer Components, The Stored Program Concept and the Internet/Fundamental Hardware Elements of Computers/De Morgan's Laws|De Morgan's Laws]], it can be seen that if any of the inputs are 0, then the output will be 1. However to be an OR gate, if any input is 1, the output must also be 1. Therefore, if the inputs are inverted, any high input will trigger a high output.

==[[NOR gate|NOR]]==
A NOR gate is simply an OR gate with an inverted output:

==XOR==
An XOR gate is constructed similarly to an OR gate, except with an additional NAND gate inserted such that if both inputs are high, the inputs to the final NAND gate will also be high, and the output will be low. This effectively represents the formula: &quot;(A NAND (A NAND B)) NAND (B NAND (A NAND B))&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Meet Author Will Hobbs!==




:Will Hobbs was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania on August 22, 1947, but because his family was in the Air Force he got to live in many different places.  This diversity of location lends important settings to many of the stories that Will Hobbs tells.  He also has enjoyed outdoor activities throughout his life, and this type of adventure is found in many of his novels. On his website http://www.willhobbsauthor.com , Will says that he hopes his stories inspire a love for the natural world, and an interest in wild places and creatures. 

:Will Hobbs says half of what he writes comes from his life experiences and half from his own personal readings.  Readers often ask him, “What made you want to write in the first place?”  That is easy to answer, because he has always loved reading.  Will says if you like reading stories, you too might start thinking, “I want to try that. I want to write a story!”  Reading books was his favorite part of school and he was a reading teacher before he became a full time writer.   

:Will Hobbs starts his writing process by winding up a little toy pterodactyl.  By the time it walks across his desk he has to start writing something. Will can credit many of his books, like ''Beardance'' to this dinosaur.  On most days he tries to write for at least six hours, as his stories go from outlines to drafts. Will says he often feels like a rat in a maze, racing down the path of one direction, finding a dead end, backtracking until he finds the direction he is looking for.

:For Will Hobbs image, voice, and audience are very important elements to his stories.  A picture he sees, or a place he visits creates strong feelings or emotions and then he starts to imagine characters that would be part of that place.  Then, these characters have conversations, and the writer becomes the listener, writing things down as they happen. Finally, it is import for Will Hobbs to stay connected to his audience, his readers.  He stays in close contact with kids.  He reads their letters and meets them in schools to discuss the books that really have engaged their hearts and imaginations.  Maybe one day you will get to meet author Will Hobbs at your school!

== Books of Interest ==

===Downriver (1991)===
:This book is an adventure story set in the well described landscape of the Grand Canyon.  The dialogue that evolves between a group of juvenile delinquents, who escape from their outdoor rehab program, brings us along for an adventure of nail biting twists and turns. Unexpected insights into troubled youth and their struggle to develop confidence, leadership, and adult like responsibility.  Middle grade students (4th-8th) will especially be drawn to the recklessness of these “River Pirates”, and teachers will appreciate this first person account of the dynamic character Jessie.  Her relationship with Troy, the manipulative “leader”, plays out interesting and relate-able way.  Readers will also enjoy the sequel, and continuation of Jessie’s river adventures in ''RIVER THUNDER'' (1997).  For more information about how and why Will Hobbs wrote Downriver visit http://www.willhobbsauthor.com/bookspages/book%20ideas%20pages/downrrthun.html

===Bearstone (1989)===
:This young adult novel has won awards from the American Library Association (ALA), Teacher’s Choice, and Notable Children’s Trade Books in Field of Social Studies (NCSS). The awards reflect the story’s vivid descriptions of the continental divide, Rio Grande Pyramid, and “The Window”.  But readers will relate to the inner dialogue of fourteen year old trouble-maker Cloyd, who is based on a real student acquainted with author Will Hobbs.  Cloyd’s adventures lead him to work for Walter on his Colorado ranch.  An unexpected relationship develops between Clyde and Walter through their adventures with wildlife, mines, and poachers. Some elements are historical and accurate, but it really is a fun adventure for middle aged students who love the outdoors. Will Hobbs sequel to ''Bearstone'' is ''Beardance'' which continues with the character Cloyd as he tries to run the ranch and save the grizzlies. For more information about why Will Hobbs wrote the sequel to ''Bearstone'' visit http://www.willhobbsauthor.com/bookspages/book%20ideas%20pages/bearstondanc.html.

===Beardream, illustrated by Jill Kaster (1997)===
:This children’s picture book based on the research that Will Hobbs did for his novels’ ''Bearstone'' and ''Beardance''.  He came across the idea that the Ute people learned the beardance from bears themselves and turned this idea into a children’s novel.  The lyrical writing follows “Short Tail”, a young Ute boy who sets off to find the Great Bear in the mountains.  In the layered, magical illustrations, the boy and bear seem to become one, and the beardance is taught and learned. The conclusion is a mysterious weaving of tradition, bravery, and preservation that accurately mirrors Native American Ute culture.  This book is written for children ages 6-9, but could be a delightful introduction for a secondary level Native American study.      

===Jason's Gold (1999)===
:An ALA Best Book for Young Adults, Jason’s Gold is a page turning adventure that seamlessly combines fact and fiction surrounding the Alaska Gold Rush of the 1890’s. Untold riches lure Jason into the wilds of real life settings like Chilchoot Pass and Dead Horse Point.  In ALAN review, teachers are reported to use Jason’s Gold as part of a four week unit in conjunction with The Call of the Wild.  Students were able to more easily understand this classic because they already understood the historical, geographic and social conditions present in Jason’s Gold.   Jason’s Gold presents a strong protagonist character that students can follow through adventures of courage, friendship and endurance. In appended notes, author Will Hobbs even discusses his research and lists sources.   

===Kokopelli's Flute (1995)===
:This novel is Will Hobb's first try at fantasy. Set in the southwest, amid Anasazi Ruins, the main character Tepary plays a magical flute under a lunar eclipse and gets more than he bargained for. Unexpected insights into a ancient culture occur night after night, as Tepary transforms into a pack rat.  Understated themes of nature,disease, preservation, and agriculture blend together to create a delightful plot and mood. Time travel is fiction, but this story has us suspending our disbelief for a while.      

===Go Big or Go Home (2008)===
:In Will Hobb's most recent published work, you might be expecting an account of extreme sports. However, the book stems from the on historical account of a Martian meteorite that supposedly contained traces of life.  Unexpectedly, the story takes place in the Black Hills of South Dakota, where the main character Brady's physical changes lead him to think he has been infected by some virus from Mars. This novel would be a great springboard for topics in astrobiology, physics, as well as issues in mining, environmental biology, and Native American site preservation.  
 
===Notes about the Author's Work===
:Will Hobb's books are diverse in location, but locations are paramount to his stories.  The author's style is casual, written with dialogue that is easily understood by current middle aged students (4th-8th grades). Often the books are written from a boy's perspective, and the characters have something to prove.  Each story is reminiscent of a coming of age story that a grown up might recall to his own children.They are often told in the first person, from the point of view of the main protagonist.  His novels  contain historically and geographically accurate descriptions.  Students can generalize about times and places through the adventures of Will Hobb's characters.  These trade books are excellent spring boards for discussions about social studies, science, and environmental topics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Biographical Information ==

Jane Yolen, born in 1939, was raised mainly in New York City. She is a first generation American . Her father immigrated to the U.S. from the Ukraine when he was only 4. Her mother's family immigrated from Lithuania when she was also a child.  Her father fought in World War II and was sent home a hero due to an injury.  A passion for writing was evident in Jane's family.  Her father was a journalist and her mother wrote short stories, although they were never published.  A gold star student, Jane wrote her first poem in preschool, which she still reads to young students today. [http://www.adlit.org/authors/Yolen Click here] to hear her read this poem. In first grade she produced a class musical.  She and her brother, Steve, even wrote a newspaper for their apartment building, which their mother helped them to type and distribute.  Jane wrote throughout her school career, writing poetry in college that was published in small journals.  Her first book, &lt;u&gt;Pirates in Petticoats, &lt;/u&gt; was published on her 22nd birthday.   

Jane brings many of her life experiences into her stories.  Books such as &lt;u&gt;Naming Liberty&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;Honkers&lt;/u&gt;, and &lt;u&gt;Harvest Home&lt;/u&gt; clearly reflect Yolen's Jewish background as well as the immigration of her family to the U.S. Jane's husband, David, was often called &quot;The man who knew everything&quot; and was the inspiration behind her book &lt;u&gt;My Father Knows the Names of Things&lt;/u&gt;.  &lt;u&gt;Soft House&lt;/u&gt;, a story about a sister and brother building a blanket fort, could very well be based off of the real relationship between Jane and her younger brother.  The characters in &lt;u&gt;Owl Moon&lt;/u&gt; are based off her daughter, Heidi, and her deceased husband, David.

Jane has written over 300 books including  folktales, fairytales, science fiction, poetry, informational books, picture books, young adult novels, and more. Her writing has been honored in many different forms including: the Caldecott Medal, Nebula Awards, the Rhysling, an Asimov’s Magazine Reader’s Poll award, World Fantasy Award, a National Book Award nomination, three Mythopoeic Fantasy Awards, a Golden Kite Award, the Skylark Award, Jewish Book Award, two Christopher Medals, the Association of Jewish Libraries Award, the Charlotte Award, the Garden State Award, the Golden Sower Award, among many others.  Jane's books are often referred to in Journals such as &lt;u&gt;Adolescent and Adult Literacy&lt;/u&gt; and on &quot;Reader's Choice&quot; lists.

Jane currently divides her time between Massachusetts and Scotland. When Yolen's husband, David, was on sabbatical in Scotland they fell in love with the country and ended up buying the house they were renting.

Here are some pieces of advice that Jane Yolen wanted to give young readers and writers.

&quot;People--and often kids--make the mistake of thinking that once (a story's) on the page, it's done, but that's only the beginning. I constantly reshape and revision my work. I dream it again, imagine it again--that's the exciting part of writing.&quot;


&quot;Impossible events can become exciting fantasy stories.&quot;


&quot;We all have experiences that are strange, magical, and wondrous.&quot;

Illustrated by Bagram Ibatoulline (2009)

&quot;An autumn eve, the moon was high. As yellow as a black cat's eye.&quot;  Each page of this book contains two beautifully written poetic stanzas that tell a story of a scarecrow.  The poetic use of language gives this story a musical quality.  The words are carefully chosen in order to give each stanza a rhythm and rhyme, like a melody of a song.  Beginning with the very first stanza, quoted above, Yolen paints a story with her words through the use of figurative language devices.  The personification of the scarecrow dancing through the night and stopping to listen to the prayer of the young boy who lives on the farm, helps the reader connect to the character of the scarecrow.  The use of simile to compare objects like &quot;As yellow as the black cat's eye&quot; and &quot;He danced by barn as red as blood&quot; provide the vivid details that make the amazing illustrations come to life.  With this book Yolen creates a story that is musical to the ear, making it a fun story to both read aloud and listen to, while Bagram Ibatoulline creates images that are pleasing to the eye. These beautiful illustrations draw the reader into the story.  Any reader would be instantly engaged.

[http://www.amazon.com/Soft-House-Jane-Yolen/dp/B000V4R1M0/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303856492&amp;sr=1-1 &lt;u&gt;Soft House&lt;/u&gt;] Illustrated by Wendy Anderson (2005)

What do you like to do on a rainy day?  In &lt;u&gt;Soft House&lt;/u&gt;, Yolen tells the story of a brother and sister who are trying to fight boredom on a rainy day.  The relationship between the character, Alison Isabelle, and her younger brother, Davey, seems to be very true to life through the use of well-written dialogue that one may hear in any household between a brother and a sister.  A back and forth argument such as &quot;You can't count either. Can. Can't. Can!&quot; The mother calling from the kitchen, &quot;Alison Isabelle, what are you doing to your little brother?&quot; Alison Isabelle responds with &quot;NOTHING!&quot; These interactions make the story come to life.  Although the story is short, we also get to see Alison Isabelle learn something important about being an older sister.  This unexpected insight comes when she realizes that &quot;you can't be scared when you have a little brother to take care of.&quot;  Anyone who has ever been young with nothing to do on a rainy day, or who has a younger brother or sister that they take care of, would engage and connect with this book.

&quot;My father knows the names of things. Each bird that sings, their nicknames too. He knows the names of dogs and cheese and seven words that all mean blue.&quot;  This excerpt from the book  gives the reader a feel for the creative rhyme and rhythm that is created through the use of Yolen's simple but precise word choices.  The use of poetry gives the story a musical feel while the dedication page is very touchingly dedicated to the memory of Yolen's deceased husband David Stemple &quot;The man who knew everything.&quot;  This is a loving and living memory of someone who is dear to the Yolen family and a poignant reminder, to any reader who has ever lost a loved one, that people live on in the memories of the people left behind.  The musical language combined with the colorful  illustrations by Stephanie Jorisch make this story  very inviting and engaging for readers.

[http://www.amazon.com/Naming-Liberty-Jane-Yolen/dp/0399242503/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1303856407&amp;sr=1-1 &lt;u&gt;Naming Liberty&lt;/u&gt;] Illustrated by Jim Burke (2008)

This is a story about the dream of freedom.  It is both the story of a young Jewish girl who dreams of coming to America, and of a Frenchman who dreams of creating a symbol of freedom to give to the United States.  Yolen does a magnificent job weaving together these two stories side by side on each page, making the ending of this story very powerful and moving.  It is full of well- written dialogue that captures the dreams and hopes of immigrants coming to America to reconnect with loved ones who have already come before them. &quot;Aron and Jakob say 'Write to us about pretty girls and dances and parties.' I whisper, 'Just write.'&quot;  Unexpected and often understated thoughts are also present throughout this story such as &quot;But large dreams take time.&quot; Another example from the book being, &quot;It is a long way from here to our liberty.&quot;  This is not only a fictional story about immigration to America, it is the real story of the creation of the Statue of Liberty.  The end of the book contains a page entitled &quot;What is true about this book?&quot; This page gives the true inspiration and details behind this heartfelt and moving story.  This story is invigorating to all people who live in America because it is one of many stories about how and why many different people, from many different places, have come to live together in freedom. 

[http://www.amazon.com/Encounter-Voyager-books-Jane-Yolen/dp/015201389X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303856363&amp;sr=1-1 &lt;u&gt;Encounter&lt;/u&gt;] 
Illustrated by David Shannon (1992)

In stark contrast to &lt;u&gt;Naming Liberty&lt;/u&gt;,  Encounter is a story about immigration of European people to America as seen through the eyes of the Taino Natives' point of view.  I cannot do justice to how well-written this book is without a few examples straight from the book such as  &quot;…and I watched how the sky strangers touched our golden nose rings and our golden armbands but not the flesh of our faces or arms.  I watched their chief smile.  It was a serpent’s smile – no lips and all teeth.&quot;  This is a great example of the understated premises throughout the book.  Columbus is referred to only as &quot;their chief&quot; and the desire for Columbus and his men to obtain the Taino's gold, is represented beautifully with the metaphor of Columbus' smile being that of a serpents &quot;no lips and all teeth.&quot;    Another example of an understated premise is the loss of Native American culture upon the arrival of European explorers, expressed in this excerpt, &quot;So it was we lost our lands to the strangers from the sky.  We gave our souls to their gods.  We took their speech into our mouths, forgetting our own.&quot;  With this powerful conclusion also comes the unexpected insight of how an entire culture of people lost their culture. With so many students in the United States coming from Latin America, this is a story that will capture their interest as well as some of their history.

[http://www.amazon.com/Briar-Rose-Jane-Yolen/dp/0765342308/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303856272&amp;sr=1-1 &lt;u&gt;Briar Rose&lt;/u&gt;] (2002) and &lt;u&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/Devils-Arithmetic-Puffin-Modern-Classics/dp/0142401099/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1303856319&amp;sr=1-1 &lt;u&gt;The Devil's Arithmetic]&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/u&gt; (1988)

A review of Jane Yolen's work would not be complete without a reference to these two novels. The tragedies and horrors that Jewish people faced during the Holocaust is a topic that must be meaningful to Yolen on a personal level-she being Jewish. In fact the research that went into writing these two novels was such an emotional experience for Yolen that she had expressed not having an interest in writing any other books about the Holocaust. &lt;u&gt;Briar Rose&lt;/u&gt; is a retelling of Sleeping Beauty.  The comparison between the kingdom being put to sleep under a powerful spell in Sleeping Beauty and the Jewish people being &quot;put to sleep&quot; in the gas chambers of a real castle concentration camp, known as Chelmno is deeply moving.  The use of this metaphor to tell the real life horror paralleled with a children's fairy tale is one of the many reasons why Yolen's writing is so great and this story is so incredible. A word of warning, Briar Rose is not a story for children; it was originally written as an adult novel and, therefore, contains adult content.  It has appeared on many banned books lists.  This is an indication of how important the issues are that Yolen addresses in this novel and is precisely why it would be so engaging and important for older students to read.  Controversy is always intriguing and engaging.  &lt;u&gt;The Devil's Arithmetic&lt;/u&gt; was a novel intended for young adults.  In fact, Yolen uses the apathetic nature of a teenager to tell a story of a young girl who travels back in time to realize the horrors of the Holocaust first hand. The vivid descriptions of concentration camps add historical accuracy, but can be very disturbing in some parts.  The way that Yolen is also able to connect past events to the main characters current life delivers the important message that the past is important to honor and remember so that it is not repeated. Yolen's gift for writing was rewarded with this novel when she received the National Jewish Book Award.  It was also nominated for the Nebula Award for both the book and movie version.  It has clearly touched the hearts of the many people who have read it and I believe that it would do the same for those who have not read it yet.

I am leaving out [http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=owl+moon &lt;u&gt;Owl Moon&lt;/u&gt;] here for two reasons. First, it is one of her most popular books and I wanted to focus on books that are not as widely known.  Second,  it is an award winning book and is worth reading and drawing your own conclusions.

==Comparing and Contrasting Books==

The books that I would like to spend a little more time comparing and contrasting are &lt;u&gt;Encounter&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;Naming Liberty&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;Briar Rose&lt;/u&gt; to &lt;u&gt;The Devil's Arithmetic&lt;/u&gt;.

I believe that reading these books in conjunction with each other was a great learning experience for me.  They both told the story of America from two very different but equally important perspectives.  In comparison, they both tell the story of Americans and the hardships that people have faced in the process. In contrast, these stories differ in many ways as well.  In &lt;u&gt;Naming Liberty,&lt;/u&gt; the story of immigration is about hope and gaining something: freedom.  In &lt;u&gt;Encounter,&lt;/u&gt; the story is about the loss of culture, and therefore, freedom.  &lt;u&gt;Naming Liberty&lt;/u&gt; is about immigrants who willingly came to America for a better life and &lt;u&gt;Encounter&lt;/u&gt; is about what happened to the people who were already living in America when Europeans came.  Both stories are about  a better life that was found in America, but for only one group of people.

The comparisons between &lt;u&gt;Briar Rose&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;The Devil's Arithmetic&lt;/u&gt; are also easy to compare.  They both are stories about the Holocaust.  They both have women as the main characters.  They both contain vivid and accurate details about the horrors of concentration camps.  It is where these two stories differ that I believe is really what is important.  &lt;u&gt;Briar Rose&lt;/u&gt; is told through the use of a comparison to the fairy tale Sleeping Beauty.  The women do not come out of this story alive.  The theme of this story is purely about the tragedies that occurred during the Holocaust and the politics behind it.  It does not only focus on the racism that the Jewish people faced, but also the way the homosexual people were subjected to the same cruel and deadly treatment.  &lt;u&gt;The Devil's Arithmetic&lt;/u&gt; contains a theme that is more about the importance of remembering and honoring history.  It is about asking people to remember events that are not pleasant, but that are important.  The main character in this story does survive, and returns to her own time with a better understanding of the horrors that people faced  just like those told in &lt;u&gt;Briar Rose&lt;/u&gt;.

==Author's Style and Recurrent Themes==

With so many different books that have been published for so many different audiences, it is hard to say what Jane Yolen's style is.  It is her style to be both poetic and passionate in one story, while being completely silly and off the wall in another.  It is her style to tell stories about real events and people, yet it is also her sty/e to tell stories about animals. There will always be precise vocabulary in her well chosen words, and insights into life that anyone can identify with and relate to.  Some of these common themes that are found in Yolen's books are: multicultural perspectives, relationships, growing-up, nature, historical events, religion, independent women, and music.  No matter what she is writing or who she is writing it for, another thing that will also be found in Yolen's writing is a powerful lesson to be learned.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Natural Number==
The natural numbers are the ordinary counting numbers 1, 2, 3, ... 

They can be expressed mathematically:
:ℕ = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, ... }

Some mathematicians consider 0 to be a natural number. This convention is common in logic and computer science. ℕ⁰, ℕ₀ and ℤ₀+ unambiguously denote the set of non-negative integers, while ℕ*, ℕ⁺, ℕ₁ and ℤ+ unambiguously denote the set of positive integers.

The greatest natural number does not exist: for every possible natural number n, there exists n+1 which is also a natural number.

All natural numbers also belong to complex numbers.

==Even Number==
Even numbers are natural numbers that are divisible by 2.
: 2N = { 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, ... }
==Odd Number==
Odd numbers are natural numbers that are not divisible by 2.
: 2N + 1 = { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15...}

==Prime Number==
Prime numbers are natural numbers that are only divisible by 1 and by itself. 
1 is not considered prime.
: P = { 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19,...}

      <comment>/* Positive Integer */ Positive numbers are often written without a + sign</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">An integer number is any of: a positive whole number (a positive integer), a negative whole number (a negative integer), or zero.

===Positive Integer===
A Positive Integer is a natural number greater than 0, i.e. a whole number. A Positive Integer can be expressed mathematically:
: I &gt; 0 = {+1,+2,+3,+4,+5,+6,+7,+8,+9,...}

Positive numbers are often written without a + sign:

: I &gt; 0 = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,...}

===Negative Integer ===
A Negative Integer is a negative whole number. This is represented by a - sign on the left side of the value.
: I &lt; 0 = {-1,-2,-3,-4,-5,-6,-7,-8,-9,...}

===Number Zero===
: I = 0

==Rules==
1)  a + 0 = a

2)  a - 0 = a

3)  a x 0 = 0

4)  a / 0 is not defined.

5)  a + a = 2a

6)  a - a = 0

7)  a x a = a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

8)  a / a = 1 (except for a = 0, which is not defined, see rule 4)

9)  a + (-a) = 0

10)  a - (-a) = 2a

11)  a x (-a) = - a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

12)  a / (-a) = -1 (except for a = 0, which is not defined, see rule 4)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fraction==
Fraction is a ratio of two integer numbers. Fraction can be expressed mathematically 
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{B}&lt;/math&gt;, where B is not zero.

Where 
: A is called Numerator
: B is called Denominator

==Equal Fractions==
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{B} = \frac{C}{D} &lt;/math&gt; when A = C , B = D
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{B} \frac{D}{D} = \frac{C}{D} \frac{B}{B}&lt;/math&gt; when AD = BC

==Rules==
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{B}&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\frac{C}{D}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{AD + BC}{BD}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;\frac{A}{B}&lt;/math&gt; - &lt;math&gt;\frac{C}{D}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{AD - BC}{BD}&lt;/math&gt;

An imaginary number is a number whose square is less than zero.

e.g.
: &lt;math&gt;j = \sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

==Conjugate Number==
: &lt;math&gt;-j = -\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;


==Rules==
1) j + j = 2j

2) j - j = 0

3) j x -j = -1

4) j / j = 1

5) j + (-j) = 0

6) j - (-j) = 2j

7) (-j) x (-j) = -j&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1

8) j / (-j) = -1

Complex Number is a number that can be expressed mathematically as a sum of a Real Number and an Imaginary Number
: &lt;math&gt;Z = A + jB &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z = |Z|\angle \theta &lt;/math&gt;
:: &lt;math&gt;|Z| = \sqrt{A^2 + B^2} &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===VCO characteristic===
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: center; color: grey; width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;
A VCO block is present in some (not all) types of CDRs.&lt;br&gt;
It is present in all slave CDRs, regenerators and end points (but not in phase aligners).&lt;/div&gt;
The VCO ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-controlled_oscillator| Voltage Controlled Oscillator]) is a circuit that outputs a single frequency signal (some VCOs output a sinusoid, some VCOs output a squarewave) in response to the level of the signal applied to its input; the frequency of its output is proportional to the value of its input signal (the latter is sometimes an analog voltage, sometimes a digital number):
&lt;center&gt;output_frequency  ''&lt;small&gt;[cycles/sec]&lt;/small&gt;'' = VCO_gain ''&lt;small&gt;[cycles/sec/volt]&lt;/small&gt;'' * control_ signal ''&lt;small&gt;[volt]&lt;/small&gt;''&lt;/center&gt;
It is convenient to study the PLL in the s or jω domain using the phase as the output variable. The model equation is then:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;center&gt;output phase y(s) ''&lt;small&gt;[rad]&lt;/small&gt;'' = control_signal(s) ''&lt;small&gt;[volt]&lt;/small&gt;'' * G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt; ''&lt;small&gt;[rad/sec/volt]&lt;/small&gt;'' / s ''&lt;small&gt;[1/sec]&lt;/small&gt;''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;text-align: right; color: grey; width:auto; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;&quot;&gt;
Note that the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_analysis| dimension] of the complex variable '''s''' is: '''''[sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;]'''''&lt;/div&gt;

[[Image:VCO characteristic.png|center|680px|]]

The VCO shall be made track the frequency of the incoming signal pulses (f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) by the feedback of the PLL in the lock state.&lt;br /&gt;

As the free-running frequency characteristic of the VCO, f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;, never exactly coincides with f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, the control signal  -while the PLL is tracking the input signal - exhibits an offset from its center value, proportional to the frequency mismatch:
&lt;center&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = steady-state drive error = (ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; – ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;) / G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
where:
&lt;center&gt;G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;small&gt;[rad/sec/volt]&lt;/small&gt;'' = (ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; – ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;)''&lt;small&gt;[rad/sec]&lt;/small&gt;'' / (max - min)''&lt;small&gt;[volt]&lt;/small&gt;''&lt;/center&gt; .&lt;br /&gt;
E&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; should not be confused with E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs#Loop type and steady state error|(that has been introduced earlier in this book]] and that will be [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 1#The steady state error due to fp – ffr difference and the steady state error of the sampling time|addressed again in some special cases again further on)]].&lt;br&gt;
&lt;center&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is always present in a PLL and has a non-zero value as in the formula above, no matter what the loop type of the PLL is,&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; instead is non-zero only in type 1 PLLs (1-1 and 2-1), while it is zero in the type 2 PLL (2-2).&lt;/center&gt;


'''The VCO is''' very often '''the most critical block''' in the CDR, because
#it operates at the frequency of the received line pulses f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; (or close to). It uses therefore the fastest circuitry in the PLL, along with the phase comparator.
#the value of f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; must be very precise. Precise component like quartz crystals or trimmed R, C, L must therefore be used inside the VCO (The phase comparator does not require precise components).
#it generates most of the added phase noise that the PLL cannot reject or mitigate.&lt;br&gt;
The block that precedes the VCO, and that drives it, i.e. the amplifier/filter, is less critical in the sense of cost, need of precise components and noise.&lt;br&gt;
As a consequence, it is convenient and correct to model and to simulate the PLL under the simplifying hypothesis that the circuit that drives the VCO matches exactly with its output range the input range of the VCO connectd to it.



===Frequency accuracy of the VCO for tight jitter rejection of the PLL===
'''Relative concepts'''&lt;br /&gt;
Jitter as well as frequency accuracy are both relative concepts.&lt;br /&gt;
They describe the relative mismatch  of two quantities (two phases that are functions of time, or two frequencies). The mismatch does not need:
*either of the quantities to be considered the reference for the other;
*a third quantity as independent reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

'''Frequency accuracy and acquisition time'''&lt;br&gt;
The free-running frequency of the VCO (f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;) represents the information available inside the CDR about the expected frequency (f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;) of the signal to lock into.&lt;br&gt;
The maximum instantaneous difference |f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; – f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;| is a known parameter of the CDR, called accuracy and often expressed in ppm as  |f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; – f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;| / f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; .

This accuracy can also be seen as the maximum drift in a second (in cycles per second) that, at the very start of the acquisition phase of the PLL, is present between the phase of the signal to lock into and the phase of the VCO in its free-running state.

All PLLs have a low pass behaviour with respect to the processing of the input phase signal, and their cut-off frequency is called  ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; or ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;.

It will be shown that it takes a time about 1/ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; (for a first order PLL, and about 2/ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt; for a second order PLL) for a PLL to react to a step change of the input phase and to recuperate about 70% of the distance from the optimum lock-in condition.

The PLL VCO is normally kept in its free running state as long as an incoming signal is not detected (LOS = Loss Of Signal condition).

When released because the LOS has been de-asserted, its acquisition transient is nothing but the same as a reaction to an abrupt phase change.


The acquisition will take place without slips if the PLL reaction time is (approximately) shorter that the time of half a cycle drift:
&lt;center&gt;1/ω&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;  &lt;small&gt;''(or 2/ω&lt;sub&gt;n2&lt;/sub&gt;)''&lt;/small&gt;  &lt;   1/(2*|f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; – f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;|)&lt;/center&gt;


'''Dejittering limit, theoretical and practical'''

The value of the accuracy |f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; – f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;| sets the lower limit for the cut-off frequency of the dejittering that the CDR can perform.

It  will also be shown that, in most CDR architectures, [[Clock and Data Recovery/Structures and types of CDRs/The (slave) CDR based on a second order PLL/2nd order type 1#The steady state error due to fp – ffr difference and the steady state error of the sampling time|the tightening of the dejittering bandwidth increases the offset of the sampling time]].

::&lt;small&gt;''The jitter cut-off frequency in practice will not be as tight as the theory would allow.''&lt;/small&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;''In those CDRs where tight dejittering is required, the jitter cut-off frequency will be appreciably higher than that limit, to leave margin both for manufacturing tolerances and for fast acquisition times, as well as to keep the sampling time offset reasonably small.''&lt;/small&gt;
Jitter at lower frequencies than the cut-off will be accepted as clock fluctuations, at higher frequencies will be rejected as effectively as possible.
CDRs with a stringent dejittering requirement (=regenerator CDRs) will make use of VCOs with high f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; accuracy, that are typically based on a controlled crystal or on a precise clock reference followed by circuitry that can change phase or frequency around the center value (like DLLs or variable ratio dividers).




===The VCO of the PLL as a frequency demodulator===
When a VCO is part of a PLL, the VCO output coincides with the PLL output.

The VCO input instead is a node whose signal tells exactly the frequency at which the VCO, and therefore the PLL, is operating.

In other words, the PLL can be seen as a frequency demodulator of the signal at its input where the VCO input acts as the frequency demodulator output!

In the following pages, the PLL transfer function (from the instantaneous phase of the PLL input x(s) to the instantaneous phase of the PLL (=of the VCO) output y(s)) will be obtained for different PLLs, combining the individual transfer functions of phase comparator, amplifier/filter and VCOs.

Such transfer function is called the PLL “jitter transfer function”:
&lt;center&gt;y(s)/x(s)&lt;/center&gt;
The VCO transfer function, when the phase is the output variable, is  G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;/s.

The transfer function of the PLL, from input phase to VCO input is:
&lt;center&gt;VCO&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;(s)/x(s)  =  (y(s)/x(s)) / G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;/s&lt;/center&gt;
If, instead of the PLL input phase x(s), the PLL input frequency x&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;(s)is considered, x(s) must be replaced by the transform of its derivative  x&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;(s):    s x(s) = x&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;(s) → x&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;(s) = x(s)/s
&lt;center&gt;VCO&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;(s)/x&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;(s)  =  (y(s)/x&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;(s)) / G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;/s =  (y(s)/x(s)) / G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/center&gt;
Apart from the fixed coefficient G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;u&gt;the &quot;demodulator&quot; transfer function&lt;/u&gt; ''&lt;small&gt;(PLL input frequency to VCO input voltage)&lt;/small&gt;'' &lt;u&gt;is the same as the PLL jitter transfer function &lt;/u&gt;&lt;small&gt;''(PLL input phase to PLL output phase'' (= VCO output phase)'')''&lt;/small&gt; &lt;u&gt;!&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This conclusion may help later in the book to quicker visualize the PLL behavior in some special cases and conditions.&lt;br&gt;
For instance, all PLLs have phase (=jitter) transfer functions with 0 dB gain from 0 to low frequency and high frequency cut-off.&lt;br&gt;
The very same frequency diagram (just scaled by the value G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;) will hold good for the inherent frequency demodulator, with the same bandwidth, etc.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;



===Modeling and simulation of the VCO===
:'''with (in)accuracy included'''
[[Image:VCO curves x model n simul.png|center|580px|]]
Both in the model equations and in the simulation calculation formulae,&lt;br&gt;
the finite accuracy of the VCO can be taken into account adding an input bias to the (ideal) VCO.


====VCO model====

[[Image:VCO_model_equations.png|center|560px|]]

The VCO function is represented as a block with linear relation of its input signal (ranging around 0 volt) with respect to its output frequency (that ranges correspondingly around f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;br&gt;
It is more convenient to consider the instantaneous phase of the VCO output as output variable, because the inclusion of a VCO block in a PLL model becomes straightforward.&lt;br&gt;
Phase and frequency are related by a differential operation, as the phase is the integral function of the frequency and the latter is the derivative of the former.&lt;br&gt;
As angular frequencies in preference to period frequencies are used in conjunction with Laplace transforms (s = r +jω), the VCO gain G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt; is expressed in [rad/sec/volt]  and the (precisely centered) VCO transfer function is written as (see the figure above):
&lt;center&gt;out(s) / in(s) = G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt; / s&lt;/center&gt;
The drive error E&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;, preceded by a minus sign, is the signal addition needed at the VCO input to take into account in the model the lack of accuracy of the VCO itself.&lt;br&gt;
A VCO that is absolutely accurate becomes “inaccurate” by the amount (ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;) if a d.c. bias equal to -E&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; is added at its input.
The saturation outside the range ω&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;...ω&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; is not taken into account by the model, that is linear. Such non-linearity is incorporated instead in the simulation equations.



====VCO simulation====
If the input signal reaches outside +/- 1 volt (see the purple &quot;Curve for simulation&quot; in the figure above), the (simulated) VCO freezes itself either at ω&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; or at ω&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;, depending whether the input signal is lower than -1 or greater than +1.&lt;br&gt;
To take into account the VCO accuracy (i.e. the mismatch between ω&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; and ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;), the VCO shall be simulated as:
&lt;center&gt;'''output_frequency = ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; + input_signal * G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt;''' {{spaces|8}} ''when -1 &lt; input_signal &lt; +1''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;'''output_frequency = ω&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;''' {{spaces|15}}{{spaces|15}}{{spaces|10}} ''when input_signal &lt;= -1''&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;center&gt;'''output_frequency = ω&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;''' {{spaces|15}}{{spaces|15}}{{spaces|10}} ''when input_signal &gt;= +1''&lt;/center&gt;

The amplifier/filter output swings between -1 and 1 volt, with 0 volt corresponding to 0 volt at its input.&lt;br&gt;
Clamping completes the computation of the amplifier output signal,&lt;br&gt;
simulating at the same time both the amplifier/filter output limitation and the VCO range limitation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

After clamping this output to +/-1 volt, the -E&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; bias is added.&lt;br&gt;
As a result, the simulated VCO runs at ω&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; when the filter output is 0 volt, ω&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; when the filter output is +1 volt  and ω&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;  when the filter output is -1 volt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

To simulate the conversion of the output frequency (linearly proportional to the VCO input) into the output phase, an integration is made.&lt;br&gt; The first value is computed as the first VCO input multiplied by the discrete time step of the simulation.&lt;br&gt;
Any subsequent entry is the previous value incremented by the present VCO input multiplied by the discrete time step of the simulation.&lt;br&gt;
To take into account the VCO gain, the result obtained in the previous calculation is multiplied by G&lt;sub&gt;VCO&lt;/sub&gt; and the simulated value of the VCO output is obtained.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The PLL closed loop simulation, in addition to the E&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; value, will also show the transient and the final value of the corresponding steady state error E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; (if finite).



===Different types of VCOs===
[[File:10 stages ring oscillator.png|thumb|left|upright=1.80|alt=A ring oscillator is made of inverting and of non-inverting stages. The total number of inverting stages must be an odd number.]]


The Sections above have presented with some detail the classic VCO model (that is a valid model for many VCOs in actual CDRs) and have given suggestions on how to simulate it.


The [[Wikipedia:Ring oscillator|'''ring''' oscillator]] is an example.
 

It is often used in monolythic CDRs&lt;ref&gt;Analysis of Timing Jitter in CMOS Ring Oscillators, Todd C. Weigandt, Beomsup Kim and Paul R. Gray, Proc. of ISCAS, June 1994, a paper included in Monolithic Phase-locked Loops and Clock Recovery Circuits, Theory and Design, IEEE PRESS, ISBN 0-7803-1149-3&lt;/ref&gt; where VCO low noise is not the prime requirement. (An '''LC''' oscillator -hybrid or monolythic- is used used in that case&lt;ref&gt;Analysis, Modeling and Simulation of Phase Noise in Monolithic Voltage-Controlled Oscillators, Behzad Razavi in Proc. CICC, pp. 323-326, May 1995, a paper included in Monolithic Phase-locked Loops and Clock Recovery Circuits, Theory and Design, IEEE PRESS, ISBN 0-7803-1149-3&lt;/ref&gt;).
{{-}}
[[File:Delay locked loop, 0th order type 0 and 1st order type 1.png|thumb|right|upright=2.4|&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt;The delay locked loop is a variable delay line whose delay is locked to the duration of the period of a reference clock.&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on the signal processing element in the loop (a flat amplifier or an integrator),&lt;br /&gt;
the DLL loop can be of 0&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; order and type 0 or of 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; order and type 1.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;]] 
When analyzing existing CDRs, different VCOs may be encountered, and a different simulation or model may be more appropriate:
# '''bang-bang between two frequencies''' &lt;ref&gt;Richard C. Walker (2003). &quot;Designing Bang-Bang PLLs for Clock and Data Recovery in Serial Data Transmission Systems&quot;. pp. 34-45, a chapter appearing in &quot;Phase-Locking in High-Performance Sytems - From Devices to Architectures&quot;, edited by Behzad Razavi, IEEE Press, 2003, ISBN 0-471-44727-7.&lt;/ref&gt;(simple although somewhat noisy, can be integrated easily inside an IC).
# Fixed free running frequency f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;, followed by a '''variable ratio divider'''...(possible if the technology allows a start frequency much higher than &amp;omega;&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;). The inherent non linearities of the characteristic can be made smaller if a higher start frequency can be chosen and if the division ratio can be controlled  with many close steps.
# A [[w:Delay-locked loop|DLL]] whose output can be sequentially (and circularly) taken from the output of each of its stages by a multiplexer, so that the output phase can be varied indefinitely. The multiplexer could be driven:
## by a A/D conversion of the control signal. The resulting VCO is an oscillator controlled in phase and its model is simply a fixed gain. The gain is equal to the delay line control gain G&lt;sub&gt;dl&lt;/sub&gt; multiplied by the A/D gain (sec/volt) if the VCO output is measured in seconds, or equal to to G&lt;sub&gt;dl&lt;/sub&gt; x G&lt;sub&gt;A/D&lt;/sub&gt; multiplied by the ratio: delay_line_length / oscillator_angular_frequency, if the VCO output is measured in radian.
## by an integrator plus A/D ( or by an accumulator if the implementation is digital) and then to the control input of the delay line. This adds a 1/s factor to the VCO model
{{-}}



===VCO noise===
No oscillator is exempt from [[w:Phase noise|noise]], and the oscillator noise affects the CDR performances.

The output waveform of an oscillator is never perfect in shape and immobile at its nominal frequency. 
Its power is not an impulse at f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;, but it is distributed around it and exhibits a sort of &quot;bell&quot; shape.


Noise may in theory affect the amplitude, or the phase, or both, in the waveform produced by the oscillator.&lt;ref name = &quot;IEEE Std 1139-1999&quot;/&gt;

Avoiding non-fundamental discussions, it is always assumed that the amplitude of the output waveform of an oscillator is constant and does not contribute to the oscillator noise. 

Just its phase (phase or frequency, which is the same thing) jitters and generates the noisy behavior. 

In other words, '''the oscillator noise that can be measured is made up of phase noise only'''. &lt;ref&gt;Clock (CLK) Jitter and Phase Noise Conversion, MAXIM APPLICATION NOTE 3359, http://http://www.maxim-ic.com/app-notes/index.mvp/id/3359 &lt;/ref&gt;.
&lt;small&gt;This assumption corresponds to the condition that there is no correlation between the power in the upper and lower side-bands.&lt;ref name = &quot;IEEE Std 1139-1999&quot;/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;  

It is also generally assumed that phase noise is small and can be treated with linear models.
&lt;small&gt;This assumption practically corresponds to the condition that the total jitter corresponding to the phenomena under investigation never exceeds &amp;pi;/10&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name = &quot;IEEE Std 1139-1999&quot;&gt;IEEE Std 1139-1999 IEEE Standard Definitions of Physical Quantities for Fundamental Frequency and Time Metrology—Random Instabilities, http://www.umbc.edu/photonics/Menyuk/Phase-Noise/Vig_IEEE_Standard_1139-1999%20.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;


When a CDR is left free-running because no received signal is present (LOS Loss Of Signal = 1), then all the VCO phase noise is present at the CDR otput.
&lt;small&gt;(This is relevant and may become problematic in regenerators, but is not very relevant in end-points and in phase-aligners)&lt;/small&gt;.

When the CDR is regularly operating and locked, the VCO frequency shifts and coincides with f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;.

It will be [[Clock and Data Recovery/Noise is shaped by the PLL structure|shown]] that, when the CDR is in lock, the VCO phase noise that reaches the CDR output is progressively attenuated from the loop characeristic frequency downwards. 

Very close to f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; the VCO phase noise that reached the CDR output is attenuated to negligible levels.



How much an oscillator deviates from the ideal behavior is normally described by its [[w:Spectral density#Power spectral density|Power Spectral Density]], PSD.

The PSD is always finite, and peaks at f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; when the oscillator (the VCO) is free-running, or at f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; when the VCO is locked.

&lt;small&gt;When a CDR is in lock, the PSD of the VCO, centered around f&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, exhibits essentially the same side-bands than when free-running.&lt;/small&gt; 
[[File:Oscillator spectrum.pdf||center|770px|]]
The PSD curve looks different if the vertical axis scale is logarithmic (used when the side-bands are important) or if the scale is linear (used when the fundamental frequency of oscillation is more important than the side-bands)

The Power Spectral Density of an oscillator can be measured in dBc/Hz (or in another logarithmic unit, that yields the same curve but translated upwards or downwards) or in W/Hz (linear y-scale).

The horizontal x-axis is linear and centered on the fundamental frequency when PSD is described on both sides of f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt;, to avoid asymmetrical representation of the two side-bands.


The phase noise proper '''''L''(f)''' (pronounced “script-ell of f”), is defined (and measured) as one half (= the upper half) of the double-sideband PSD of the oscillator. It is a function of the frequency offset between the frequency of measure and the oscillator center frequency.&lt;br /&gt;
''&lt;small&gt;It may be noted that the definition does not exactly include the oscillator center frequency (or frequency = 0 of phase noise). Very slow phase noise or wander is at the same time difficult to deal with and of difficult measure. It belongs to a different engineering topic, like a very little frequency offset or like a very selective spectrum analyzer or like a measurement that takes a very long time. As it is of vert little or of no practical use for the engineering of phase noise in oscillators, it is left out.&lt;/small&gt;''&lt;br /&gt;
When expressed in decibels, the units of '''''L''(f)''' are dBc/Hz (dB below the carrier in a 1 Hz bandwidth at a distance f from the center frequency).



====Logarithmic axes==== 
The logarithmic y-axis representation is necessary when the oscillator noise is measured.

If only the upper side-band of the oscillator phase noise is described, then also the x-axis is preferably logarithmic.



====Modeling====
Modeling of the oscillator noise describes just the upper side-band of the oscillator spectrum (and the preferred scale of the x-axis is also logarithmic).

In most practical cases, the oscillator noise PSD uses the oscillator fundamental frequency as a zero reference, and the difference f-f&lt;sub&gt;fr&lt;/sub&gt; as independent variable.

To avoid unnecessary troubles (mathematical &amp;infin;/0 for a model; infinite selectivity and/or dynamic range for a measure), the description  does not reach down to zero frequency difference, but gets very close (so that only a minor amount of power, i.e. PSD x frequency interval, is neglected).

The [[w:Leeson's equation|well known model]] was proposed by Leeson (February 1966).

A fundamental paper is also the one from A. Hajimiri and Thomas H. Lee (1998)&lt;ref&gt;A General Theory of Phase Noise
in Electrical Oscillators, by Ali Hajimiri and Thomas H. Lee, IEEE JOURNAL OF SOLID-STATE CIRCUITS, VOL. 33, NO. 2, FEBRUARY 1998  http://www.chic.caltech.edu/Publications/general_full.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Robotic Control ===

There are several kinds of robotic control. Ideally the robot must have some type of communication with the user in order to execute commands. The most common forms of robotic control is a remote control. However, there are other, more effcent kinds; such as voice command, and programming scripts that the robot can execute on its own.

[[File:US Navy 090207-N-9610C-058 Quartermaster Seaman Alyssum Richards, from Sequim, Wash., familiarizes herself with the controls for .jpg|thumb|US Navy 090207-N-9610C-058 Quartermaster Seaman Alyssum Richards, from Sequim, Wash., familiarizes herself with the controls for ]]

=== Remote Control ===

Robots tied to a remote control, weather by string or by radio signals, are controlled directly by their master. In short, they cannot operate without a person who is handling the controls. This among all things, is a less efficent type of autonomy. However, it has its uses. For example, robots that do not have artifical intelligence can be used as extentsions of the human hand. A &quot;tool&quot; if you will. Therefore, remote control robotics is the first and most important in the controlling of robots


=== Voice Control ===

Just like a few other electronic systems out there, robots can also respond to voice command. However, the idea is often shunned upon. The complexities of the human voice are an issue. As a persons high or low pitched voice may throw off a robots response completely. Another issue is that of the robot script, which requires the robot to follow commands the user has given them through voice data. If it interprets the command wrong, it may give unwanted results. 

Several Movies have recorded this as a bad idea, Stealth and I-robot are examples of some robots that have gone haywire. And in short, could cause the whole world a lot of problems.


=== Programming ===

Programming robots to execute predetermined scripts or to act accordingly to the problem can be something of trial and error. Before a robot is even usable it must go through rigorous testing for bugs and other problems. However once the script is finalized and the robot is ready to go, it can be one of the most satisfying ways to control a robot. Military forces use it now in drones and unmanned spy planes to survey the area. However, it is still far from perfect

== Robot Hardware ==

Robots can be build from inexpensive parts, to expensive, military grade devices. In a sense, the ability of the constructor is a large factor in how expensive a robot can be to build. If needed or wanted, a person can build most of the devices to run a simple robot by hand. However, no matter how sopfisticated the robot is, it still needs some essential components.



&lt;u&gt;Design&lt;/u&gt;

Robots are built in a variety of ways, with a variety of pieces. However before one decides to build a robot, it is always best to have some type of design plan. This allows you find errors in the build and workaround or fix them immediately. Be sure to always have a plan before building a robot.

&lt;u&gt;A Way to Move&lt;/u&gt;

[[File:3 motors de corrent continu.JPG|thumb|3 motors de corrent continu]]

You can say whatever you want about a robot, but its ability to travel distances is often an essential component for a robot build. whether it be a wheeled or bipedal robot, the main thing used to get a robot moving is motors. Motors can be built in a variety of ways. Motor building is always about the weight of the robot vs the power of the motor. Meaning a robot that is not constructed to hold nothing but its own weight should be as light as possible. Given an object to carry or hold, the motors should be able to give extra power, bearing friction and stalling  issues. In the design room, one should always look to lessen the weight of the overall robot while maintaining a strong skeleton.


&lt;u&gt;Power&lt;/u&gt;

A robot cannot operate without some type of power. The most widely used form of power comes in the form of batteries. This is, of course, tied into your motor and other electrical components tied with your robot, so it is best to choose the right voltage for the job. Key features to look for in a battery: strength, rechargeable, cost effective.


&lt;u&gt;Microcontroller&lt;/u&gt; 

[[File:ATmega32 microcontroller.jpg|ATmega32 microcontroller]]

If power is the heart of a robot, then the Micro-controller is essentially the brain. The micro-controller is a programmable circut board, that can be read and executed for commands to the robot. It is necessary.

&lt;u&gt;Sensors&lt;/u&gt; 

[[File:Photoresistor.jpg|Photoresistor]]

Photoresistors- Great for obstacle avoidance, if programmed correctly, the robot will avoid shadows.

== Obstacle Avoidance ==

Can you imagine our most advance robots of today without the ability to avoid obstacles? I highly doubt that you can. In fact today’s Robots are what they are because of their advanced abilities, their abilities to make “sensible decisions” on their own. If our robots were unable to avoid obstacles their purpose in my opinion would be crippled. Fortunately our robots of today are able to avoid obstacles. 
There are a number of ways which these robots achieve this feat.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;  www.Roborealm.com presents some of these ways. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
To achieve obstacle avoidance robots can used the edge based method. For example look at the picture seen below. This picture has been taken by a camera mounted onto the robot.
 
What an edge based method will do is highlight the edges of the obstacles in the robots eyesight. 
 
Using further measures this program will flip the picture then determine the farthest and clearest path that it can run along. 
 
In the next picture calculations are added to the picture which produces the path where the robot can run on to avoid obstacles.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

== Programming Concepts  ==


'''&lt;u&gt;Introduction&lt;/u&gt;'''

Robotic Programming is not as daunting as one might think. Given the current state of technology, robotic software that is designed for menial tasks are easy to to code, compile, and run. However, the most advanced robotics are using programming languages that are scripted specifically for Robotic programming.


&lt;u&gt;Hobby Robot Programming&lt;/u&gt;

[[File:Lego Mindstorms Nxt-FLL.jpg|thumb|Lego Mindstorms Nxt-FLL]]


Most hobby robotics (i.e. small time robotics) will use a number of ways to give robots small tasks and instructions. The first is a programmable controller that can execute scripts or software and run it with very little trouble. An example of this is the NXT/RXC Bricks used in the Lego Robotics kits. These bricks are programmable and are able to run a wide variety of software. They are also able to support multiple firmwares, which allow for more flexible programming. Examples are the NXT-G GUI interface, Robot C (based on the c++) and Lejos NXJ (Java programming for Robots)

However, there limitations are large, as they can only do so little. They cannot run a script that runs forever, and cannot run on a day to day basis. However, despite their limitations, this is one of the easier ways to construct and prepare a robot.



'''&lt;u&gt;Industrial Robot Programming&lt;/u&gt;'''

[[File:Robotics Cutting Bridge Building Parts.jpg|Robotics Cutting Bridge Building Parts]]

For industrial Robots, most of the maufactuars supply the software along with the robot. This is due to the lack of a global programming standard in industrial robotics.Programming in these robots are often based on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow Dataflow] Programming. This language is able to process both numerical and functional concepts. An example of a dataflow language is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_Programming_Language Microsoft Visual] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_Assembly_Language VAL].

Since the companies who make each robot provide their own software


'''&lt;u&gt;Other Types of Programming Language &lt;/u&gt;'''

'''Scripting languages'''

This language is used to control a software application, and is &quot;translated on the fly&quot; with out prior compiling. They are often used to glue several components of software together.

== Robot Vision ==


To get your Robot to perceive its surroundings you may use a range of devices. These may include, light sensors, color sensors, ultrasonic sensors or even a digital camera. I find interesting how we can be surrounded by this technology and have no idea how it works. Therefore presented below “”After reading below you will understand how it is that digital camera technology works.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;
[[File:Digital Camera.svg|thumb|Digital Camera]]
Think first of the way that a solar panel works. Solar panels are made up of a number of cells, now each cell takes in light energy and then converts it into electrical energy. Consequently, the more light there is, the more energy there is. Now, digital cameras have light sensor. In some cameras this light sensor is a Charge Coupled Device (CCD) while in other cameras it is Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor also known as CMOS. &lt;br/&gt; 
The CCD like a solar panel has many little squares that can be compared to the solar panels cell. Its little square will absorb the light energy and then create it into electrical energy. The condition of the light such as intensity or brightness is recorded by a varying electrical charge. The firmware which is stored on this camera then takes this information that is received from each little square and arranges the picture which is perceivable to the human eye.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
[[File:CCD charge transfer animation.gif|thumb|CCD charge transfer animation]]
More details of this can be found at:
 http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/technology-explained-how-does-a-digital-camera-work/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Going a step further Robots not only can be equipped with these camera s but these cameras can be setup in a number of ways to supply a live feed. For example a robot can be equipped with a trendnet IP camera. These IP cameras will sync with a server and hold an IP address which you can access and from where you can view this live feed.

== Robots and Artificial Intelligence ==


[[File:Artificial.intelligence.jpg|Artificial.intelligence]]



'''&lt;u&gt;Introduction&lt;/u&gt;'''

The subject of Artificial Intelligence is one of the most highly controversial topics in all of robotics. The thought that a robot can gain an actual level of intelligence brings thoughts of them maybe ruling us all. However, rest assured that we are still years away from developing a robot with such sophistication


&lt;u&gt;'''In popular culture'''&lt;/u&gt;


[[File:I robot.jpg|I robot]]

You can take a number when it comes to movies that talk about this subject. It is always the same process, man relies to heavily on machine and the machine decides to take over. This can range from the the comical take in ''Wall-E'' to the serious tone of ''I-Robot''. This is often the subject of many movies and books because it satirizes man's use of machines. 


&lt;u&gt;In real life&lt;/u&gt;

Currently, there is no official proof of a being created by man that can think, talk, and function by itself. Humans have been able to, to some extent, teach robots how to mimic human actions. In Japan, scientist have taught a robot how to dance. Another robot, by the name of Kismet, which was developed at M.I.T, speaks to humans and responses accordingly. This fact has them intrigued, however there is more difficulties to this subject than just responding to humans. 



&lt;u&gt;How Far Are We?&lt;/u&gt;

Plain and simple, the subject of A.I. is highly theoretical. The fact of developing an artificial brain requires us to know our own brains. How they function, the nervous system, and a way to actually replace it. Until that time, you can stop worrying that your PS3 will take over the world

== Knowledge Based Vision Systems ==

As you may have never heard this term before, you may be asking, what is knowledge based vision system.  If you were to look on the internet you would find that information on the internet can be a little scarce when it comes to the topic of Knowledge based vision systems. So then let us discover this concept step by step. First we will look at knowledge base systems. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;
According to dictionary.com a knowledge base is a collection of knowledge expressed using some formal knowledge representation language. A knowledge base forms part of a knowledge-based system (KBS).&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;
Now going further let us look into what a knowledge base system is:
According to dictionary.com a knowledge base system is a program for extending and/or querying a knowledge base. The related term expert system is normally used to refer to a highly domain-specific type of KBS used for a specialized purpose such as medical diagnosis.  The Cyc project is an example of a large KBS.&lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;
Based on these definitions, I would come to the conclusion that a knowledge base vision system is a  is a knowledge base system which is used for the robots vision activates. This knowledge base system would enable the robot to distinguesho colors and shapes and even light intensity and would then tell the robot how to react to these. &lt;BR/&gt;&lt;BR/&gt;
Below is an iserpt that you can read from “ Wang, J. (n.d). KNOWLEDGE-BASED ROBOT VISION SYSTEM FOR AUTOMATED PART HANDLING.South African Journal of Industrial Engineering, 19(1), Retrieved from EBSCOhost.”
&lt;BR/&gt;
The architecture of a robot vision system may be regarded as hierarchical. The robot vision functionalities may be partitioned into, first, low-level vision, which includes those processes that are primitive and require no intelligence such as image acquisition and image preprocessing; and, second, high-level vision, which includes extracting, modeling, recognition, description, and cognition. 
&lt;BR/&gt;
Robot vision system starts with visual data collection, and ends with a description and interpretation of the object’s geometric features. In robot vision systems, geometric feature extraction and representation are the two most important issues to which a solution must be found in terms of the application requirements.

== Mathematics and Robotic Control ==


&lt;u&gt;???&lt;/u&gt;

Yes there is Math involved with some of the most difficult parts of robotics. Simply put, all sciences require some form of mathematics. For Robotics, the use of Math can be seen in the concepts of Robot Programming Languages, Path Drawing, and Building a Robot.



&lt;u&gt;Robotic Programming Languages&lt;/u&gt;

Most Programming Languages are able to compile and process numerical data. They read binary code and give the instructions to the given microcontroller. If you are giving judgments to a robot, such as how much light it can travel in before it must turn around then you must give it variables in the form of numbers to judge. This is a key component in deciding what you want your robot to do. 

&lt;u&gt;Path Drawing&lt;/u&gt;

Imagine that you were building a zone for your robot to patrol. However, u want to give it instructions to travel a perfect perimeter, with objects in a path that you want your robot to avoid or strike, and return to its path. This would require a specific algorithm that only math can provide.


&lt;u&gt;Building a Robot&lt;/u&gt;

Of course this thought also applies to building a robot. No matter what material, you need to know how long, wide, tall, you want your robot to be. If you need to measure its arms for symmetry, or if you need to determine weight totals to find out the perfect motor to power your robot, Mathematics will help you with that

== Task Planning and Navigation ==

In robots, task planning is used to plan a sequence of actions that allow the robot to perform a complex or high level task. This will require that several types of knowledge are encoded in the planner. These are casual knowledge, knowledge of the effects of the robot’s actions, knowledge of objects in the world such as their properties and their relations. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;[[File:Maker Faire 2008 San Mateo 186.JPG|thumb|Maker Faire 2008 San Mateo 186]]
For Example, if robot had to go into a kitchen open the refrigerator grab a bottle of milk then bring it to some one. The task planner would have to produce a sequence of actions like “go to the kitchen, dock to the fridge, open it, grab the milk bottle, then return. The planner will need to know certain things if the robot is to carry out these tasks. The planner needs to know that milk is kept in the fridge, and that fridges are kept in the kitchen.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Knowledge about structures and the current state of the world is usually encoded in the form of a map. The robot can then make decisions based on information which it has stored within itself based on this map.

== The Future of Robotics ==

When one hears the future of robotics he is easily tempted to think that the near future is filled with androids making decisions on their own, cleaning our houses, doing our chores, having intelligent conversations with us and the like. One thing is true, that the human being is a complex creature Robots still have an extremely far way to go before they can match humans. Take for example walking. Many robots are still fitted with wheels, tracks or a crawling mechanism. This is because of the great task that walking which we do so easily is actually complex. When we lift our legs we instinctively shift our weight to the other side of our bodies changing our center of gravity. We balance our selves so that we do not fall. Though this action almost seems like nothing to us it is a complex task for a robot to carry out. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

[[File:Osborne Executive with iPhone in 2009.jpg|thumb|Osborne Executive with iPhone in 2009]]

Still More’s law has seemed to be accurate. Computers and their technology are growing at a fast rate.&lt;br/&gt;
Take for example the picture to the right which shows an iPhone compared to a Osborne Executive.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Since technology does grow so fast the future of Robotics may hold optical computers that switch photons rather than electrons. Or DNA computers using sequences of bases to encode information. Or even quantum computers encoding information by manipulating the rotation of an atom.

== Overview ==

No description of the '''''Blibbering Humdinger''''' is ever given to us. From the fact that only [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] seems to believe in its existence, we can safely assume that it springs from the fertile imagination of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood, her father]]. 

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

The Blibbering Humdinger is first mentioned in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']] when Luna Lovegood says that people used to think that they didn't exist.  [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] replies that they were right, because they ''didn't'' exist, causing Luna to slouch off, annoyed.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], after the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Battle of Hogwarts|Battle of Hogwarts]], Luna, seeing how tired [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is, distracts the people around herself and Harry Great Hall by saying, &quot;Ooh, look, a Blibbering Humdinger!&quot; This allows Harry to don his [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Invisibility Cloak|Invisibility Cloak]], and collect [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] and Hermione without anyone noticing.

== Overview ==

'''''Heliopaths''''', a magical creature apparently springing entirely out of the mind of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood]], are supposedly &quot;spirits of fire&quot;, giant flaming creatures.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], during the initial meeting of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Defence Association]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Hog's Head Inn|Hog's Head]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna]] says that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]] has an army of Heliopaths, telling [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]] that they are spirits of fire, &quot;great flaming creatures that gallop over the ground burning everything in front of them&quot;. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]] states that they do not exist; Luna then angrily counters this by saying that there are plenty of eyewitness accounts of them. The incipient argument is only broken up when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] imitates [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dolores Umbridge|Professor Umbridge]].

== Analysis ==

It is interesting to note Hermione's anger at this invention. Hermione, as we've seen, is somewhat hidebound, believing what she is told by &quot;authority,&quot; whether that is teachers or books, and finds Luna's belief in this, and other apparently nonsensical creatures, aggravating. Curiously, this seems to be the last time in the series that one of Luna's invented creatures angers Hermione; after this, she seems wryly amused rather than upset at Luna's beliefs. No explanation is visible for this, but we can speculate that the abuse of authority she sees in Umbridge weakens Hermione's faith in authority in general. Alternately, of course, it may be simply that Hermione, maturing, sees much less in the world as being pure black or white, and becoming more accepting of unusual viewpoints.

features=Lives in mistletoe|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Nargles''''' are magical creatures that live in mistletoe. As [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] is the only character in the series known to believe in their existence, we can safely say they spring from the imagination of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

At Christmas in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], Luna Lovegood notes that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] is standing under some mistletoe in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]]. When Harry hurriedly steps away, Luna says that it was &quot;good thinking&quot; on Harry's part, as the mistletoe is &quot;probably full of Nargles&quot;. Later, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]] is amused at Harry's mention of Luna's belief.

== Analysis ==

Luna's saying that it was good thinking to step away from the mistletoe is an indication that Nargles, if not harmful, at least have unwanted effects if they happen to fall on one.

Harry's later mention of Luna's belief serves to lighten the mood of the following encounter with Cho.

== Overview ==

As it is only ever mentioned by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]], we must conclude that the never-described '''''Umgubular Slashkilter''''' springs from the fertile imagination of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xenophilius Lovegood]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

During the first meeting of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Dumbledore's Army|Dumbledore's Army]] in the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Room of Requirement|Room of Requirement]], in ''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'', Luna says that her father is very supportive of anti-[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Ministry of Magic|Ministry]] action, in part because of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]]'s Umgubular Slashkilter. When [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cho Chang|Cho Chang]] opens her mouth to ask what it is, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]] tells her, &quot;Don't ask&quot;, causing her to giggle.

== Analysis ==

The only information we have about this creature is Luna's reporting Xenophilius' dislike of the Minister for Magic possessing one. This seems to imply that it is dangerous in some way.

# If this creature does indeed exist, why do you think it is not included on the Hogwarts syllabus?

== Overview ==

'''''Wrackspurts''''' are invisible creatures that fly in through your ears and cause momentary confusion. As [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] seems to be the only character who believes in their existence, we can guess that they spring from the fertile imagination of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood]].

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

On the Hogwarts Express in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], Luna Lovegood, seeing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry's]] momentarily befuddled expression, asks, &quot;Wrackspurt got you?&quot;  She then proceeds to explain that they are invisible and &quot;fly in your ears and make your brain go fuzzy.&quot;  She then waves her arms about her head as if warding off flies, upon which Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] look at each other and hastily begin to talk about [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Quidditch|Quidditch]].

When the Trio visit Xenophilius Lovegood's house in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Xenophilius explains that one of the components of his recreation of the diadem of Ravenclaw is the Wrackspurt siphon (which looks like a golden ear trumpet), &quot;to remove all sources of distraction from the thinker's immediate area.&quot;

== Analysis ==

One wonders whether Xeno truly believes in Wrackspurts, or has consciously created them to explain what is known in the Muggle world as a &quot;senior moment.&quot;

name=Dirigible Plum|
type=Magical plant|
features=Looks like an orange radish|
appearance=[[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']]}}

== Overview ==

'''''Dirigible Plums''''' are a possibly magical plant mentioned in connection with the Lovegood family. It is described as resembling an orange radish.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

Dirigible Plums first appear in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], where we see [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Luna Lovegood|Luna Lovegood]] wearing them as earrings. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], seeing them, wonders why anyone would wear radishes on their ears.

We also see her wearing them numerous times in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']]. To Harry's relief, she leaves them behind for the Christmas party in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Horace Slughorn|Professor Slughorn's]] rooms.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], the Trio see them in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Xenophilius Lovegood|Xeno Lovegood's]] garden, where they are named, for the first time, by a sign that reads:

PICK YOUR OWN MISTLETOE&lt;br /&gt;
KEEP OFF THE DIRIGIBLE PLUMS

In discussion with Xeno Lovegood, the Trio discover that he is attempting to replicate [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rowena Ravenclaw|Rowena Ravenclaw]]'s lost Diadem. This diadem was supposed to give Ravenclaw additional intelligence. One of the components of the Diadem under construction is a Dirigible Plums attached at the forehead, which Xeno explains is to &quot;enhance the ability to accept the unexpected.&quot;

== Analysis ==

One wonders why these fruits would be called &quot;dirigible plums&quot; as &quot;dirigible&quot; implies some sort of ability to set a direction. From the limited description we have, however, we can deduce that like radishes, dirigible plums come to a point. Presumably, their &quot;dirigible&quot; nature is indicative of the fact that, because of this point, they can be given an orientation, a direction.

Xeno's explanation of the use of Dirigible Plums in his recreation of Ravenclaw's Diadem clarifies why Luna is always wearing them as earrings. However, we have already seen that Xeno has unconventional ideas, including belief in the existence of creatures like the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Crumple Horned Snorkack|Crumple-Horned Snorkack]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Nargle|Nargles]], and in magical effects caused by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Gnome|Gnome]] bites; it is quite likely that Xeno's belief in their effects is just as misplaced.

I have written two examples. For me, the description in English is difficult. Perhaps someone can translate the German source, and write a decent description.

Created by: Matthew Realley and Mustafa Khan


1.	The Future of Robotics: Since their creation, robots have spread to many fields, from military applications to factory tasks. The future will see only more of this expansion for robots, as it did for computers. One example is South Korea’s plan to have robots perform surgery (est. 2018). iRobot (maker of the Roobma robotic vacuum cleaner) claims that by 2033, robots will perform most household tasks. In the United States Military, according to the Department of Defense, one third of the fighting units will be robots by 2015.


2.	Programming Concepts: Programming languages are used to make computers do specific tasks. While many can do similar things, they each vary from one to the other. One way they vary is also the first concept gone over in this section, syntax. According to Wikipedia, syntax is the “set of rules that define the combinations of symbols that are considered to be correctly structured programs in that language.” What this basically means is that syntax is the words/commands that tell the program what to do and the order they are put in. The next programming concept is variables. Variables are 	a way to store values, be they characters, strings, integers, or non-integer numbers. There are also Conditional Statements in most programming languages. These tell programs what to do in specific cases. In English, these statements say: if one thing is true, do a specific thing, but if it’s not true, do something else. The final concept I will discuss in this section is loops. Loops cycle through the same code for a set amount of time, or until a condition is no longer true. Each cycle is referred to as an iteration.


3.	Robot Control is the way which robots sense and act, and how they relate to each other. It varies based on the objective of the robot. Robot Control is broken down into four main categories: deliberative control, reactive control, hybrid control, and behavior-based control. Deliberative control involves the robot heavily analyzing and calculating BEFORE acting. Reactive control involves the robot merely reacting to stimuli (hence the name). Hybrid control involves both happening simultaneously. Behavior-based control involves the robot automatically acting a certain way based on specific circumstances.


4.	The hardware we used in class was Lego Mindstorms. This DIY robotics kit was made up of 619 elements:

LEGO TECHNIC building elements 
gears, wheels, tracks and tires
1 NXT micro-computer – that acts as the brain of the robot
2 Touch Sensors – that makes the robot feel
1 Ultrasonic Sensor – that makes the robot ‘see’ - and detect motion
1 Colour Sensor – that can detect different colours, light settings and acts as a lamp
3 Interactive servo motors with built-in rotation sensors
7 connector cables for linking motors and sensors to the NXT


5.	The mathematics of robot control vary on the type of control the designer is trying to create in order to accomplish a specific task. Deliberative control would use complex functions and algorithms to do specialized, highly purposeful actions. These functions would take up a lot of processing power and wouldn’t make for a quickly reacting robot. Reactive control merely has the robot react to stimulus, so it requires far less complex mathematic equations. Hybrid control uses the same amount of complexity in mathematics as deliberative control, but while simultaneously reacting instantaneously to stimuli.


6.	There are many options in programming languages for the Lego Mindstorms NXT. The some of the most well known and popular are: NXT-G Retail, NXT-G Educational, 	RoboLab 2.9, NBC,  NXC, RobotC, NI LabVIEW Toolkit, leJOS NXJ, pbLua, LEJOS OSEK, ICON. Follow this link for a side-by-side comparision on the features of all of the aforementioned programming languages.
http://www.teamhassenplug.org/NXT/NXTSoftware.html


7. Obstacle avoidance is the process of a robot obtaining its control to avoid an illegal intersection or collision with an object in its path. Robots can easily avoid objects if they are being controlled with a remote because the person holds the control and easily direct the robot around an object or to a more secure pathway. That is known as pre-computational where a robot is controlled and can easily perform obstacle avoidance. A more complex way for a robot to perform obstacle avoidance is without any remote at all.
Remote less robots are able to perform obstacle avoidance in many ways. One way is that there is an obstacle course and a program which runs a robot is predefined to calculations that already measure distances of the objects and directs the robot ahead of time to move around it. Other robots contain sensors which can be program to recognize that something maybe in its path and it is told how to react when there is something there such as an ultrasonic, light, and touch sensor from the NXT Lego mind storms robots. Those can be programmed to read a distance, light intensity as it approaches an object, or touch a object and know what actions to perform to  undergo its obstacle avoidance. 
Another way is based on more advanced technologies. For robots to avoid obstacles they must be preprogrammed with lots of discipline. These technologies help robots to understand the dynamics in scenarios of real life applications which maybe complex and understand characteristics of an object they are trying to avoid such as shape, size, and if so its own moving path. Most robots that are performing obstacle avoidance do not take into account its own shape and size which will be need to know. Setbacks such as that can be preprogrammed so a robot can know how it must move majority of the time to avoid obstacles. 
Many of obstacle avoidance for robots are done on platforms which contain obstacles that a robot must avoid to complete its course. Many places that have mobile robots use computational computers and cameras to record the environment in which a robot is moving through. The vision it sees isn't the same as a human would see. The vision is broken down to a more computerized look breaking down the surroundings to a plane and objects or obstacles to linear pictures coming out of axes' to represent them. If a mobile robot is moving through an unknown environment then it must be able to read scenarios of the path it must follow, the objects it must avoid, and how it would go about doing that. All of these are computational based on what the robot reads. This is an ongoing research and it can potentially lead up to driverless or steer less vehicles in the future. 

8. Task Planning is key for mobile robots because it allows it to determine its course or objective over a course of time. A robot must contain a sort of reasoning abilities to know what paths or direction is the most efficient for it to use. At most levels of robotics, task planning is used to determine a sequence of actions in order to fully surpass its course. A useful thing a robot may use for task planning is semantic maps.
Semantic maps gives a robot a worldly like view of what it is going to encounter and decided on what it has to do. The information they obtain is known as semantic knowledge. This allows the robot to perform in a more remote less and intelligent manner. Semantic maps are also important in two ways for task planning: determines what new information actually is physically and what information doesn't affect or need to be used for certain tasks.
When looking at new information a robot must determine if it is in the right environment firstly. Its task maybe to perform one thing, but its location maybe the wrong place to complete the task. It has to be able to read and learn the environment and then remember that is the wrong environment for the next time. After recognizing, when they reach the correct environment, a robot must remember to follow through with its original task is planning to accomplish.
Navigation is very important for a robot to achieve. It has to be able to avoid and navigate through hazardous areas they may cause it to collide with other objects or even cause itself to malfunction. Navigation is important because a robot has to able to have a self knowledge to interpret not only its own features and capabilities, but to determine if the environment is capable of being navigated through. 
 
9. Robot vision is a vital part of robotics because it allows a mobile robot to envision a path for it to travel. This is where a robot may get its own sense of what a human eye can see, but in its own fashion and conditions. Robot vision allows the system and machinery of autonomous robots to be more productive and efficient for human research. Robots are attached with cameras that allow them to interpret what it sees or reads with the camera.
There are many different ways robot vision works to help better understand images that we see every day. A robot may see many things with cameras, but may never know what anything actually is. There is research done where a robot is connected to the web and when it reads or senses and object, it uses the web to find images of similar structures to get a better understanding of what the object is. Once it gets that, it will always be able to determine that object every time it sees it through visual models.
Another way a robot vision works is through image formation. The eyes of a human may see things in specific models to recognize is, but the eyes of a robot, the camera, and sees things in different structures. The camera shows map version of the 3D world and a robot has to be able to process it. It has to have the knowledge of knowing what is what through the process of edge finding. Edges have to be separated based on if it is an object in the robots way or if it is a path with turns and curves. Not only is edge finding important, but also light and color recognition. In our society today we know what many objects or signs such as a stop sign is based on its shape and color. If worldly use of an actual autonomous vehicle is to be created then something as simple as recognizing what the color red usually means is necessary.
Robot vision also goes a long way before even knowing what images are. They also have a mathematical stand point. The mathematics works through the program. Whatever a robot sees it is calculated in sort of a 3D space to know shape and sizes of objects. If a mobile robot needed to surpass an object then it would need to determine from it saw the amount of space it needed between itself and an object, the distance it has move, and when it is safe to move in front of it. All that is determine because of the robot's vision and how it implements what it sees through the cameras.

10. Knowledge based vision systems are more like image processing and object recognition software. The image processing comes from the vision of the robot whether its curves or edges that it reads. Its divides everything it sees into parameters to be interpreted. The object recognition is the ability to realize what an object is based on a hierarchy of details it reads from previous same or similar objects. It will determine what an object is by the features that the object contains and are the most acknowledged.
Knowledge based vision systems are important because they need to recognize changing environments so it can know to be cautious and slow down to begin to try and interpret new objects through object matching. Because the cameras see a different version on the world it has to be able to distinguish between the real world objects and the virtual world objects and compares them to see if they are the same or if they are somewhat different. Also the robot must know how to manipulate the space it has based on the objects of its environment so that it may navigate productively.

11. Artificial Intelligence plays a great deal in robotics because of the concept of machine learning, the ability for something without a brain to act and react as if it did have a brain. Scientifically it is known as neural networks which are the robotics version of human neurology. Neural networks are more mathematical in programming robots. There are equations that derive errors and are re-entered as hidden values.
The mathematics of machine learning comes from the back propagation. There is an input or what the robot sees, then it interprets it, and the interpretation is put into an equation which has a solution that is trying to be reached. If the solution isn't reached then it back propagates and regenerates a value so that the solution maybe reached the next time. That's how the learning process works. It’s more like learning from mistakes. A robot's artificial intelligence begins an action, but if it fails it will attempt another option, but has learned that the first option it tried to do doesn't work.
There are many robots and machines to day that work on artificial intelligence. One example is the Osimo robot by Honda. It is able to free walk and detect a person coming along and recognize its environment to react properly. Another example is the U.S. Military's predator drone. The predator drone is a pilotless aircraft that is actually flies and collects information. Attempts now are to make driverless vehicles that learn to read and interpret the streets of all and new environments it reaches. Many challenges would include traffic signs, pedestrians crossing the street illegally, and avoiding accidents.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Safety==
Safety is a key player in all types of welding. The human body is mostly made up of water, and water and metal don't usually go together well. Make proper use of safety goggles/glasses, gloves, leather clothing, work boots and welding helmets. Welding is '''HOT''', so keep around a metal pail of cooling oil or water, and, just in case, a can of instant-freeze for yourself. Wear earplugs if you are sensitive to loud noise, as it can get pretty loud while welding and grinding. Make proper use of and '''KNOW''' the tools you are using, if you don't know what something is or does, ask... it may save a limb or even a life. Be wary of sparks and weld flashing, eyes are extremely sensitive, and if extreme or prolonged enough, damage can lead to permanent blindness.  Additionally, arc burn on the skin over time due to excessive exposure to the light can and will lead to skin cancer as the rays give off ultra-violet rays.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== History ==
Welding has been around in some form or another ever since people realized that metal could be useful. One of the oldest methods of welding was actually forging. A metal ore would be retrieved by mining, smelted in a hot fire, collected into a large quantity of almost pure metal, and hammered into shape by using different fire techniques. Different methods of kindling, stocking and airing a fire could control the heat that it would produce. For example, to forge a sword a fire would need to heat the metal (likely copper or bronze), to a red-orange glow. Eventually, mixed metals (alloys) were used for higher strength and a range of new uses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Processes ==
====SMAW====
There are several different ways in which to weld. The most common in industrial workplaces is 'SMAW', or &quot;Shielded Metal Arc Welding&quot;. The electrode or 'stick' is placed into an electrode holder (gun or clamp style) which is then scraped or tapped onto the grounded weld piece to produce an 'electric arc', which produces enough heat to melt the 'rod' and form it into the weld piece. This process utilizes electricity to push out a &quot;glob&quot; of molten metal onto a plate(s) of metal, the 'workpiece'. Pipeline and structural welders use this method the most because of its deep 'penetration' (how much it digs into the base metal), and pressure handling capabilities. &lt;br /&gt;

====MIG/MAG(GMAW)====
The next most common method of welding is Gas Metal Arc Welding(GMAW) also called MIG or MAG welding (MIG- Metal Inert Gas and MAG- Metal Active Gas), GMAW utilizes the same principal as SMAW, but the electrode is not a 'rod', but a wire on a spool, which is fed through a 'gun'. The welder may prefer this method because of its ability to travel along the weld surface faster, and has a similar outcome in quality of the weld. However, spools of wire can be expensive, and the use of a 'shielding gas' is needed to keep the weld free of contaminants (oxidization, particles, bubbles, etc.).

A similar method of GMAW is available, Flux Cored Arc Welding(FCAW) can either be self shielded, or gas shielded just like GMAW welding.  The welder must chip slag off the face of the weld, as it stays on the cooled metal surface once the weld is completed. The main difference can be seen in the selection of the electrode wire for this process.  GMAW uses a solid wire and will be listed on the spool as for example ER70&lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;. S standing for solid wire. Flux cored is tubular and will be listed as ER71&lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;. T standing for tubular wire. 

Gas selection can also vary. 100% CO2, 75% Argon/25% CO2(75/25), and Argon/Helium/CO2 (Trimix).  CO2 is commonly used for FCAW as it causes the arc to be hotter, increasing penetration.  75/25 is the most common shielding gas for GMAW as it is relatively inexpensive, and has excellent welding characteristics.  Trimix is only used for GMAW-SS or MIG welding stainless steel.

The reader should note that the processes talked about in this chapter are the most commonly used methods that a welder may use. There are however, other methods that will be discussed in a later chapter.

====Oxy-Fuel Cutting and Welding====
Oxy Fuel cutting and welding is a skill all in itself. The terms, oxy- (standing for oxygen,) and fuel (the assortment of gases that produce combustion) speak for themselves. Oxy-Acetylene welding is the most common fuel to use, but others can include natural gas, propane, MAPP gas, gasoline or any number of 'hot' gases. &lt;br /&gt;
Generally, the principal for oxy-fuel welding or cutting is the same. Oxygen is supplied in ratio to the fuel gas, and is then lit by a sparking lighter. Valves on the torch handle control the flame (more oxygen to make an oxidizing flame, or more gas to make a carbonizing flame, or in between to make a neutral flame). Welding with oxy-fuel usually desires a 'neutral flame', with no 'feather'. A 'feather' is cooler then the 'cone', the flame at the very tip of the torch. 'Feathers' can be used to determine how carbonizing a flame is. A slightly carbonizing flame is desirable when welding with brass rod, or 'brazing', thus, the 'feather' should be present, but only slightly above the 'cone', about a half of an inch. For direct welding of steel and mild steels, no 'feather' should be present, but use of a hot 'cone' is efficient. For steel, the welder may desire to apply the use of a 'filler rod', or a long, skinny rod of metal similar to the base metal. This helps to build up a weld face and strengthen the joint. This is done by heating the base metal into a molten puddle at the base of the joint, and then 'dipping' or adding the filler rod directly to the puddle. &lt;br /&gt;
Cutting involves the same principal, but requires (in most cases) a special torch handle and head. In a regular torch head, there is only one 'orifice', or hole, for which the gas and oxygen can pass through. In a cutting torch, however, there is the one 'orifice' in the center, and a circle of orifices around it. The purpose for this is simple. The torch is lit regularly, and adjusted to a hot neutral flame. The flame is wider, more forceful and louder (although not much). The torch handle has a lever on it that allows the welder to have an extra &quot;burst&quot; of oxygen when he or she desires. This burst blows the hot metal out of the way, allowing a gap to be created, thus the cut is formed. This burst of oxygen is easier to be applied if there is more room to push the oxygen through, thus the extra orifices are essential. &lt;br /&gt;

====TIG (GTAW) Welding====
TIG welding is a form of arc welding, with the same principal to that of MIG/MAG or SMAW. An electric current is supplied, and is fed through a handle. TIG stands for 'tungsten inert gas' and GTAW for 'Gas Tungsten Arc Welding', both meaning the same thing. Tungsten is used as an 'electrode', which is semi-permanent in the torch. It carries the electric current and is used to establish and keep an arc. Tungsten is used because of its conductivity, versatility and high melting temperature. The electrode will become contaminated, however, if accidentally dipped into the weld pool. TIG is preferred by many because of its ability to weld &quot;almost any metal&quot;. As long as a filler material (rod) is available, that particular type of metal can be welded with TIG. TIG welding is achieved by operating the torch in a similar manner to oxy-fuel welding, but the operator controls the heat by means of electricity. There are 'remotes' that the welder can use for this task, or it can be set directly on some machines, so it will not fluctuate. Fluctuation is desired in some cases, where the base metal must be cooled sufficiently at regular intervals so as to not burn a hole. It should be noted that TIG is usually DC- (DC with electrode negative) which places the majority of the heat on the base material, or work piece. This allows complete fusion of the base metal and filler rod, without burning out the tungsten electrode.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SMAW ==
=== Introductory arc welding ===
Shielded Metal Arc Welding is often the first welding technique that a welder learns. A machine supplies a negative electrical circuit to the work-piece via a clip and a welding rod is attached to the positive end of the circuit. When the rod is brought close to the work-piece the current connects creating sparks and heat which melts the metal and the rod together. It requires a very steady hand and patience. It is possibly the oldest electrical welding technique still in use. Pre-electrical techniques included 'soldering', 'forging' and 'oxy-acetylene (flammable gas) welding'. It is difficult at first to weld solid bonds without creating bubbles and SMAW is important for this skill as it is easier to feel what the weld is doing (welding is only possible when the eyes are protected by darkened glass so feeling is important). SMAW is preferred in high-strength structure welding, such as construction or pipeline. It generally takes more time and patience to stick weld than it does to MIG or gas weld. SMAW should be the method spent the most time on learning for a beginner welder. Welding practice should begin with an 'E6013' 3mm rod. This is a simple rod to manipulate, and has a medium heat range, with a medium penetration. Amperage for this rod should be set in AC current, working around 85-95 amps. This is an all position rod, suitable for many general applications. 

To practice as a beginner, start with a 1/4 inch thickness metal plate around 1ft x 1ft. Do not forget to wear gloves and welders eye protection. If you are right handed start on your left, working to the right, and vis-versa for left handed (MIG welding goes the opposite direction). Try to weld straight lines across your one foot metal plate until it is covered in stripes. Chip off the black residue (slag) with a Chipping Hammer each time you pause and use a wire brush for any smaller pieces of residue. If you allow the plate to cool down (try keeping a container of water nearby to dip your hot work-piece in), you can use both sides of the same plate repeatedly until you are comfortable and steady with the rod. You should learn to hold the tip of the rod around 2mm or less from the work piece and at a 45 degree angle. It is also nessecary to change rods in the middle of a weld without affecting its quality but this should become easy when you get your pace and angle comfortably. The rod will stick to the work-piece a lot at first. You will soon find that arc welding is like blowing hot liquid from a straw in the dark (sounds complicated but is really a matter of a steady hand). You need to learn to make straight, smooth lines (beads).

When you are convinced that your welds are smooth and can maintain the tip of the rod at 2mm from the work-piece, move on to joints. The basic welding joints are T-joints (in the shape of a T, also known as fillet-joints) and lap-joints (overlapping edges, one resting on top of the other). To practice, use metal strips, 1/4 inch thickness, 2 inches wide and 8 - 12 inches long. Place two metal strips together in a T shape or overlapping and 'spot' weld at each end to keep them in place. Now weld from one side of the joint to the other in a careful, small circle motion of the rod, with an angle of 45-65 degrees (in both the up-down direction and left-right direction) keeping a distance of 1-2mm between the rod and the work-piece. It is important to hold the tip of the rod so close to the joint as a good weld will melt and fuse the edges of the original work-piece. The finished weld should look almost smooth and the slag should break off effortlessly (will take at least a few hours practice for most people). The most important part of the weld is inside. Break your finished welds open with a heavy hammer and a vice. '''Be careful!''' A good weld is ''not'' easy to open and '''''fingers'' are ''easily'' removed against a piece of steel!''' Try weakening the spot welds with a hacksaw on difficult pieces. A good weld will have decently fused the original edges together. The bead should not cut a groove into the face of the work-piece or leave bubbles and gaps in the weld (the bond should be complete inside leaving no visible straight edge under the weld). This is the requirement to pass a welding examination. Note that a welded piece will lean toward the joint as it cools. Although enough heat is required to fuse the work pieces together, too much heat will make the whole piece red hot, worsening the distortion when it cools so practice is important.

Slightly more difficult to weld correctly without warping is the end-to-end-joint (two pieces beside each other end to end or side by side). This is only slightly more difficult than the previous joints. Practice on two 1/4 inch strips as before but this time take the edges off the strips with a file or rasp so that you are welding into a V-shape. Place together at the edges and weld along the gap. The weld should be done in a careful, small circle motion of the rod, at a slightly more raised angle than before around 60-80 degrees. The finished weld should look like a &quot;stack of dimes&quot; or evenly spaced ripples in the weld. The sides of the weld should be evenly flushed with the base plate raising to a bump in the middle. If the weld looks &quot;stretched&quot;, the travel speed should be slower and the tip closer. There will be significant 'slag' and 'spatter' on the sides of the weld, and will be just generally ugly looking. If the build up of the finished weld is higher than about an sixth of an inch, the travel speed was likely too slow. Slightly more difficult again is the corner-joint (end to end in a V or L shape). Do not remove the edges of a corner joint. Instead, weld the inside first which will leave a small &quot;V&quot; shape on the outside for the final weld. The requirements for these welds are the same, properly fused without any bubbles or gaps. &lt;br /&gt;

Once these welds have been mastered, play around with welding a plate in a vertical position. Weld vertical beads going up, not down. This is significantly more difficult than a flat position, and can be frustrating to learn, but patience is important. Use a counter-clockwise circle motion, spiralling upwards, pausing at the top of each motion. It may feel more comfortable to pause at the bottom of this motion, but this will cause bad 'undercut', where the sides are not filled in with weld material.

Once this has been mastered, one may choose to continue in SMAW, or move into oxy-fuel welding for a time.
*Remember that most arc welds shouldn't be cooled in water or cooling oil, but by allowing air access around the whole joint. Cooling, in most cases, changes the way the metal atoms retract and can weaken the weld.

=== 6010 and 6011 Rods ===
E6010 Rods are the most preferred rod for deep 'root' passes, or where a lot of penetration is required. Often, this root pass is covered with two hot passes and a cap or 'face' pass with E7018 rods. This rod has been said to be one of the hardest rods to use, due to the constant attention to rod manipulation, travel speed, and 'arc length'. E6010 is a 'fast-freeze' rod, meaning it is suitable for use in all positions. It is best used with the positive polarity on the rod, or 'reverse polarity', (DC+) with amperage from 75 to 95 being the best (depending on the application). Practice using this rod by cutting (or buying) two 1/4 inch plates with about a 35.5 degree bevel on either side. The bottom of the bevel should be a sharp edge, which will be ground down to about a 3/16 of an inch lands, with either a 3/16 inch gap or 3/32, which ever is more comfortable. Start by simply running a bead down a plain 1/4 inch scrap plate to get the feel of the rod. The flux is cellulose, and is ugly looking at the end; use a wire brush and chipping hammer to clean off. Once comfortable manipulating a straight bead, place the two beveled plates together with the lands facing each other. Make sure that they are perfectly even, as this will cause less grief for the root pass. Use 80 or 85 amps to run the root pass, and start with tacking the two plates together. Weld the root with a 'backhand' motion, (pushing the rod from the base of the weld to the top). Once the root is finished, flip the plate over and wire brush off the bottom; the weld should have fallen through the gap and sealed along both sides evenly if done correctly. If this looks shallow or pitted, turn the amperage up by 5 (but to no more than 90 amps,) and try again, pitching the rod into a sharp 85 to 90 degree angle to the plates. While welding, try to 'dig' the rod into the sides of the bevel, pausing on the sides. If done right, a loud crackling-hissing noise will be heard. This is simply the 'wind' as the weld falls through the bottom of the root. Remember to keep a short arc length with this rod, no longer than the thickness of the rod itself. Otherwise, the weld will be weak, insufficient and contain excessive spatter. Also, consistently weave the rod back and forth, pausing slightly off center, both sides. Once cleaned off, the root pass should be shiny and smooth on the face side, and evenly deep on the bottom. Continue to practice the root weld until it comes naturally and comfortably, as this is a main strength of the whole weld.  &lt;br /&gt;
Next, a weld will be placed over top the root; a 'hot pass'. Turn the amperage up to 90 or 95 amps (+10% comparing to the root amperage). Weld over top of the root, digging into the sides of the bevel by weaving and pausing on each side momentarily. Minor undercut is normal in this case, and will be filled in by a second hot pass.&lt;br /&gt;
The second hot pass should be conducted the same as the first, but the welder may choose to turn the heat down by 5 amps, depending on the joint to be produced. After this, finish with a 'cap' or 'face weld', which must have no undercut on either side. This pass should be done around 85 amps. Use a weaving motion, something like upside down &quot;U's&quot;, pausing on either side to allow filler metal to fill in any undercutting.
The 6011 rod is essentially the same as a 6010, but is used in AC instead.

=== 6010 and 7018 ===
The next thing to practice is a 6010 root pass, with 7018 hot and face passes. This is a common method used often in pipeline and boiler welding. The 6010 will dig into the root pass and cause it to have a higher tensile strength. The 7018 will add more strength to the top than would a 6010 alone. It also has a lesser chance of undercutting the side, which would cause a weaker weld. For the most part, a 7018 rod is easy to manipulate, and deposits nicely. Use DC reverse (DC+) polarity around 105 to 115 amps. The flux on this rod is strange in how it reacts to moisture and humidity. A 'rod oven' is essential if these rods are going to be used in large quantities. The flux must be thoroughly dried out to be used properly, otherwise it will not protect well enough and the weld may look sloppy and weak. If only being used for a personal project, find an old baking sheet, turn up the kitchen oven to around 350 degrees, and bake the required amount of rods for about fifteen minutes. This is far cheaper than a rod oven. To practice with this rod, simply run several beads in the flat, vertical and horizontal position. If control of the 6010 rod has been achieved already, this will not be a big problem. Remember to make small cursive 's' motions on the horizontal weld, pausing at the top, and continuing through quickly on the lower area. Vertical welds should be done in a sort of 'z' motion, pausing on either side, and going quickly over the middle, zigzagging upwards. Once this has been accomplished, practice some more on the 1/4 inch plates in all these positions, welding the root with the 6010. Don't forget to grind lands into the beveled sides (about 3/16 of an inch). Once the root has been cleaned and satisfactory, use the 7018 at 105 amps DC-. For the third pass, turn it up to 115 amps DC-, and finally, for the cap weld use 105 amps again. Remember to clean between each pass, otherwise strength will be decreased. Cool slowly by leaning it somewhere that is not affected by a draft, but where room temperature is stable. Make sure that air has access to the whole plate. You can test these bevel welds by cutting each one down the middle, crossing the weld path. Grind each edge smooth, and the welds should be ground flush to the rest of the plate; both root and face sides. Place in a 50 or 25 ton press, pressing slowly into 'U' shapes. To test the root pass, place the face weld upwards. To test the face weld, simply face the root weld upwards. If there is more than a quarter inch of cracking anywhere on either weld, the weld should be retried.

From here on, any other type of rod can be tried by 'playing around', although if you are unsure, check the rod number on the internet to find the correct voltage and any other applicable setting. This includes travel speed and angle. The next thing to move onto would be MIG welding, but if at all possible (assuming the equipment is available) one should at least understand how to use oxy-fuel welding and cutting methods.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Oxy Fuel ==

Oxy fuel refers to an oxygen and fuel gas mixture being burned rapidly from compressed sources, such as large acetylene cylinders or more commonly, a propane tank (one you may find on a barbecue). A variety of fuel gases can be used in this task, such as propane, acetylene, natural gas, compressed gasoline fumes or anything else easily combustible. However, each type of gas has its own unique pro's and con's of usage.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bubble sort doesnt work! If you load top scores and then play a game and get a high scores how can your display top scores from highest to lowest?
:You must be able to launch the bubble sort procedure from the menu screen. This involves you adjusting the code to handle option 5.  See the Reset Top Scores section on how to add this option.  Let me know if you need any more help.  I have it working fine here. [[User:Pluke|Pluke]] ([[User talk:Pluke|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pluke|contribs]]) 23:27, 14 April 2011 (UTC)

::Okay, so first i get option 5 to work then what do i do.. Once running the program what do i do? Thanks for your help!
::So how do i get it to work?? First i get option 5 to work then what?? Once i load the program and enter both names what do i do next. Please help!
::Thanks man

:::You need to copy the code of the bubble sort into your code listing (learn it, learn what it does). Then you need to add a fifth menu option  Case 5 : bubbleSort(TopScores)
:::make sure that you then adjust all three menu option checks to allow for the 5th option
::: Loop Until (OptionSelected &gt;= 1 And OptionSelected &lt;= 5) Or OptionSelected = 9 ...... etc

Okay ive copied the bubble sort into my program, now what do i do? Okay adding option 5 what does it do? Does it reset topscores or does it display in order?

Thanks man

Before you read the following please try and look at the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A-level_Computing/AQA/Problem_Solving,_Programming,_Data_Representation_and_Practical_Exercise/2011_Exam/Section_D#Reset_the_top_scores Reset Top Scores] explanation on the Task D page.

| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
1. Inside the &lt;code&gt;DisplayMenu()&lt;/code&gt; sub routine add the following to allow people to select the number 5
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;4.  Display top scores&quot;)
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;5.  Print out scores in order&quot;)'added option 5
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;9.  Quit&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
2. Inside the &lt;code&gt;GetMenuChoice()&lt;/code&gt; function make sure that option choice 5 does not bring up an error by making the following change:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
        If OptionChosen &lt; 1 Or (OptionChosen &gt; 4 And OptionChosen &lt;&gt; 9) Then
&lt;/source&gt;
Update this to:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
        If OptionChosen &lt; 1 Or (OptionChosen &gt; 5 And OptionChosen &lt;&gt; 9) Then
&lt;/source&gt;
3. Update the &lt;code&gt;main()&lt;/code&gt; sub routine by making sure that option 5 does not bring up an error
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
        Loop Until (OptionSelected &gt;= 1 And OptionSelected &lt;= 4) Or OptionSelected = 9
&lt;/source&gt;
Update this to:
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
        Loop Until (OptionSelected &gt;= 1 And OptionSelected &lt;= 5) Or OptionSelected = 9
&lt;/source&gt;
4. Finally we need to add the code to run when a person selects option 5
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
            If OptionSelected &gt;= 1 And OptionSelected &lt;= 4 Then
                Select Case OptionSelected
                    Case 1 : PlayDiceGame(PlayerOneName, PlayerTwoName, True, TopScores)
                    Case 2 : PlayDiceGame(PlayerOneName, PlayerTwoName, False, TopScores)
                    Case 3 : LoadTopScores(TopScores)
                    Case 4 : DisplayTopScores(TopScores)
                End Select
            End If
&lt;/source&gt;
Make the following changes
&lt;source lang=vb&gt;
            If OptionSelected &gt;= 1 And OptionSelected &lt;= 5 Then 'change!
                Select Case OptionSelected
                    Case 1 : PlayDiceGame(PlayerOneName, PlayerTwoName, True, TopScores)
                    Case 2 : PlayDiceGame(PlayerOneName, PlayerTwoName, False, TopScores)
                    Case 3 : LoadTopScores(TopScores)
                    Case 4 : DisplayTopScores(TopScores)
                    Case 5 : bubbleSort(TopScores) 'addition!
                End Select
            End If
&lt;/source&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

Ok just realised something on the task d page case 5 says resettopscores(topscores) and the one you posted says bubblesort(topscores) so which one do i apply?
Thanks for all the help soo far! much appreciated
:Start from fresh, and use case 5.  You could always try to call it case 6.  It'll be good practice to get both 5 and 6 working at the same time [[User:Pluke|Pluke]] ([[User talk:Pluke|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pluke|contribs]]) 22:12, 22 April 2011 (UTC)

Ok, so case 5 will be bubble sort and case 6 should be resting all scores loaded to 0 right?
:try that, you should be comfortable with doing both. Let me know if you need any more help on this [[User:Pluke|Pluke]] ([[User talk:Pluke|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pluke|contribs]]) 14:56, 24 April 2011 (UTC)

Ok thanks got it working now! Can you help me on something else now? What can i do if a game is drawn? What should i do? For example i play and both users get a score of 30? What should happen? ALso if for example on of the players gets a high score of 45 and there is already a high score of 45 in the topscores table what should happen?
Thanks
:First of all test out the drawn situation and the 45 situation by using manual inputs.  What happens, what do we need to do?  This might involve a little code. [[User:Pluke|Pluke]] ([[User talk:Pluke|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pluke|contribs]]) 22:36, 1 May 2011 (UTC)

== CSV ==

Can someone confirm what is meant to happen to the function of saving csv? If you load topscores there are four players. Now if two new people play and get two new highscores its meant to replace the lowest scores on the topscores file right? But is it meant to  replace it temporarily just in while your playing the game? for example say if ur playing and get 2 topscores during the game it will replace the lowest topscores, but once you quit the game those topscores are gone. Now i want to know do you need to replace the new topscores on the actual textfile?? like i said before if i get a topscore and quit the game, is it possible to store the new topscores on the actual hiscores.txt file?? so when you start a new game next time and load the topscores it will have you in the file? Does that need to happen? If so how??
Please help!

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Amitabha.JPG|thumb|300px|Enlightened Buddha (meditating).]]
'''[[w:Buddhism|Buddhism]] is the fourth largest religion in the world. The Buddhists refer to the teachings of [[w:Gautama Buddha|Gautama Buddha]], who in the 5th Century BC, was born in Lumbini, Kapilvastu, west Nepal, born from Queen Mayadhevi. A Buddhist takes refuge in the Buddha, the Dharma (his teachings) and Sangha (the Buddhist community). The goal of Buddhist practice is to attain enlightenment.'''

==Buddha==

'''&quot;Buddha&quot; (awakened one) is a title of honor that refers to the enduring experience of enlightenment (awakening).''' A Buddha is a being who has reached full enlightenment. He has achieved nirvana and is therefore bound no longer at the cycle of reincarnation (samsara).

'''The teachings of Buddha are called [[w:Dharma (Buddhism)|Dharma]].''' Base of the Dharma are the Four Noble Truths: 1. Life involves suffering. 2. The causes of suffering are attachment to worldly pleasures, rejection of unpleasant situations and ignorance of the deeper meaning of life (enlightenment). 3. The causes can be resolved, and suffering can end. 4. The way to overcome suffering is the [[w:Noble Eightfold Path|Eightfold Path]] (right thinking, right action, right meditation, [[w:Samādhi|Samādhi]]).

We can summarize the essence of Buddhism in '''cognitive work''' and '''meditation'''. The main meditation Buddhas''' are the four stages of contemplation: 1. Sitting or going and calming thoughts by thinking. 2. Calming thoughts only through sitting or going. 3. Happiness appears by its own while sitting or going. 4. Suddenly the ego dissolves and you live in the light (Nirvana, Unity). The fourth stage of meditation is difficult to achieve for an untrained person. It is caused by grace (by itself). The more comprehensive a man is walking the spiritual path, the sooner he can live in the light (Nirvana).

'''Today there are three main sects of Buddhism (Theravada, Mahayana, the tibetian [[w:Vajrayana|Vajrayana]]) and many sub-forms (for example, the [[w:Amitabha|Amitabha Buddhism]] and [[w:Zen|Zen]] Buddhism).''' The [[w:Theravada|Theravada]] Buddhism focuses on the original teachings of Buddha. It is all about one's own enlightenment. The main goal is to be a saint (arhat) and  to live  in the Nirvana (God).

'''The [[w:Mahayana|Mahayana]] Buddhism is the way of embracing love.''' Its main goal is not the own enlightenment, but the happiness of all beings. A Mahayana Buddhist does not see himself separated from his fellow beings, but as part of the world. He wants all beings to be happy. He wants a happy world. He works as a [[w:Bodhisattva|Bodhisattva]] for the enlightenment of all beings.

==Tolerance in Buddhism==

'''Many Buddhists believe that [[w:world peace|world peace]] can only be achieved if we first establish peace within our minds.''' Buddha said, ''“Peace comes from within. Do not seek it without.”'' ([http://www.quoteworld.org/quotes/2045  Siddhārtha Gautama]) The idea is that [[w:|anger]] and other negative states of mind are the cause of wars and fighting. Buddhists believe people can live in [[w:peace|peace]] and [[w:harmony|harmony]] if we abandon negative emotions such as anger in our minds and cultivate positive emotions such as [[w:love|love]] and [[w:compassion|compassion]].

'''Buddhists have shown significant tolerance for other religions:''' ''&quot;Buddhist tolerance springs from the recognition that the dispositions and spiritual needs of human beings are too vastly diverse to be encompassed by any single teaching, and thus that these needs will naturally find expression in a wide variety of religious forms.&quot;'' ([http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bps-essay_24.html Bhikkhu Bodhi, &quot;Tolerance and Diversity&quot;.]) [[w:James Freeman Clarke|James Freeman Clarke]] said in ''Ten Great Religions'' (1871):  ''&quot;The Buddhists have founded no Inquisition; they have combined the zeal which converted kingdoms with a toleration almost inexplicable to our Western experience.&quot;''

'''The Buddhist king [[w:Ashoka the Great|Ashoka]] (269 – 231 BC) declared religious tolerance:''' ''&quot;The faiths of others all deserve to be honored for one reason or another. By honoring them, one exalts one's own faith and at the same time performs a service to the faith of others.&quot;'' (Kristin Scheible, &quot;Towards a Buddhist Policy of Tolerance: the case of King Ashoka&quot; in Jacob Neusner, p. 323)

'''The five precepts are the foundation of Buddhist morality for lay Buddhists:'''

#Do not take the life of anything living. (Do not kill)
#Do not take anything not freely given. (Do not steal)
#Abstain from sexual misconduct and sensual overindulgence.
#Refrain from untrue speech. (Do not lie)
#Do not consume alcohol or other drugs. 

'''Novice monks follow a set of 10 precepts:'''

# Don't kill.
# Don't steal 
# Don't commit sexual immorality.
# Don't speak harshly. 
# Don't speak falsely.
# Don't speak slanderously or divisively. 
# Don't speak idly. 
# Don't covet. 
# Don't have ill will toward others. 
# Don't hold wrong views. (don't think that there is an isolated self)

==Nirvana==
[[File:Buddha's statue near Belum Caves Andhra Pradesh India.jpg|thumb|200px|Blessings Buddha.]]
God is a mystery that one experiences in the Enlightenment. There are religions with a personal and an abstract concept of God. Some people need the idea of God as a person and some the idea of a higher dimension to reach enlightenment.

'''In Buddhism dominates the abstract concept of God.''' In Buddhism, God is called [[w:Nirvana|Nirvana]]. Nirvana can be achieved by enlightenment ([[w:Bodhi|Bodhi]]). Nirvana means &quot;extinguished&quot; and describes the extinction of the egoism. The enlightened feels not separated from his surroundings. He lives with his consciousness in a higher dimension of emptiness (nothingness) and unity (fullness).

'''Mahayana Buddhism works with an abstract (Nirvana) and also a personal concept of God (Buddha). Buddha is seen as the personification of Nirvana.''' As an enlightened being, he has special spiritual powers and can thus help other beings. One can pray to Buddha or the Bodhisattvas (enlightened beings). Prayers are mostly spoken as mantras in Buddhism.

== Atman and Anatman (Anatta) ==

'''[[w:Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] is a term used in Indian philosophy. It means the individual self and is often translated as soul.''' According to Hindu idea man is in his innermost being an immortal soul (atman), who reincarnates after his death in a new body.

'''The Buddhist doctrine of [[w:Anatta|anatman (anatta)]] explains the absence of a permanent and unchanging self, and of an unchanging soul.''' What is normally regarded as the &quot;self&quot; is just a collection of constantly changing, physical and psychological components. If, after Buddhism there is no fixed self, no permanent essence of a person, what is reborn? It is the karmic impulse, which establishes the connection between the individual lifes. The self is like a burning candle. At the moment of extinction, a new candle is lit from the flame. The flame (the character of a person) is maintained, the candle (the person) is a new one.

There is not much difference between the Hindu and Buddhist soul theory, if you look at the soul as a vibration field (quantum field) of thoughts and feelings. '''Hinduism emphasizes the continuity of the soul, and Buddhism the autonomy of the individual incarnations.''' Both are simultaneously true. There is continuity connected with independence. A man's character is preserved, but each incarnation feels as his own ego.

'''A soul can continue to develop. It can learn positive qualities and  meditate, and thus change its nature to enlightenment. Then it experiences itself as non-self (anatman, anatta).''' It replaces its ego through cosmic consciousness and recognizes itself as part of the cosmos. It is peaceful consciousness inside the happiness of nirvana. A soul stabilized its inner happiness (enlightenment) when it lives in peace, love to all beings, helps all on the way of happiness and gives itself what it needs.

==The Unity of All Religions==
[[File:Meditating Buddha.JPG|thumb|300px|Zen-Buddha without an ego in the unity of the nature.]]
'''Enlightenment is the center of all religions. The unity of all religions is an important goal towards building a happy world. The communication between religions is important, even when it’s sometimes difficult.''' 

Buddhist: ''It is obvious that not all religions teach the same. Buddha taught that God and the soul don’t exist. Hinduism alleges the opposite.''

Yogi: ''Our discussion clarifies many basic things.'' 

1. '''There is only one truth.''' There is only one highest reality. We can call this Nirvana, Brahman, Universe, Allah or God. 

2. '''I have experienced that there is such a thing as reincarnation.''' I have seen my earlier life.

3. '''Modern near-death research has shown that humans have souls that can think and observe independently of the body.'''

4. '''There are many clairvoyants who can see into the beyond.'''  

5. '''Buddha saw his earlier lifes once he became enlightened'''. 

6. The Buddhist teachings only make sense when we consider the reality of rebirth. Why should you work towards enlightenment through the centuries when so few reach the goal? Most people would squander their lifes if they couldn’t take the fruit of their striving into the next life. '''A Yogi resumes his practice from life to life until he has reached the goal of enlightenment. In this way, all spiritual people reach their goal at some point.''' 

7. '''Buddha had simply emphasized his teachings on the dissolving of the self. For that reason, he especially emphasized emptiness (the non-self, anatta).''' In Hinduism, fulfillment is emphasized (lots of energy, love, peace, happiness). In enlightenment there is emptiness (nothingness) and unity (fullfillment) at the same time.  

8. '''The earlier lives reveal themselves only after a certain point along the way.'''  

9. '''There is a lot of confusion among the religions of the world. I am of the opinion that all fully enlightened masters like Buddha, Jesus, [[w:Laozi|Laozi]] and Patanjali saw things the same way, they simply expressed them differently.''' 

10. '''I am for freedom of faith and opinion. I allow for the plurality of opinions and religion. I accept Atheists. I can deal with the idea of an atheistic Buddhism. I wish that all people work together for a world of love, peace and happiness.'''

==Five Basic Spiritual Techniques==
[[File:Vajrasattva Tibet.jpg|thumb|200px|Tibetan Bodhisattva, practicing with vajra (power) and bell (forwards).]]
Spiritually, humans can be compared to onions. Tensions and inner conflicts (inner stress) must be dissolved layer by layer. When one layer is peeled away, the next quickly appears at the surface until the inner core is revealed. At this point, a lasting inner joy is found, and the Yogi or Yogini lives in light. '''Inner joy appears in a person when the tentions (Samskaras) in body and soul have been dissolved.''' We need exercises for the body (Yoga, Meditation) and for the soul (reflection, Positiv Thinking). 

'''Buddha developed a very simple yet genius practice. This consisted of “sitting, going, and thought practice.”''' You need body work (Yoga, walking), mental work (reflection, reading, praying, mantra) and meditation (sitting or lying). And everything in balance, in the right moment and with the right technique.

'''When one varies one’s activities between body work, mental work and meditation, the inner conflict and tension can be done away with.''' When a person only meditates, the spirit becomes dull and listless. Routine movement makes the spirit clear, keeps the body healthy and gives the person inner energy. If you only go or do Yoga asanas, the mind is restless. Inner happiness comes from inner peace. If the body is kept very quiet, well you can get into deeper dimensions of meditation. Meditation can be practiced either in a sitting position or lying down. Some people can meditate better when sitting, others when lying down. Those who fall asleep easily when lying down, should meditate by sitting. Those who cannot sit straight for a long time should practice meditation lying down. 

'''In addition to periods of sitting and going, working with the thoughts is important in getting rid of inner conflict.''' A Yogi or Yogini should develop his or her thoughts with love, wisdom, and self-discipline. He or she should learn to bring the thoughts into stillness, until the thoughts are always tranquil. Then he or she only thinks when thinking is required. 

This basic model of stress resolution can be extended to the way of the five activities. '''The five activities are: lying down (or sitting and meditating), reading, walking (or Yoga asanas), doing good for others and to enjoy life.''' 

'''We should also bring joy into our lives. That opens our hearts, and brings light inside us. Everyone is predisposed towards something.''' You can listen to music, eat something delicious, read a good book, watch a movie, find time for your favorite creative hobbies, and so forth. It is important though, to pay attention to the amount with which we busy ourselves with enjoyment. Too much of a good thing is not a good thing, too little makes life sad. 

'''Yogis know when they need which technique.''' When the body is dull and lacking energy, the Yogi goes for a walk. When he or she feels restless, he or she practices Yoga or meditates. When the spirit seems to rebel against the spiritual way, a book on spiritual topics helps to bring back the conviction towards enlightenment. A Yogi senses the inner conflict and uses the proper techniques to dissolve the tension. That is usually what the body and soul wants the least at that moment. Wherever the neurotic tendency to feel repelled towards something is usually the way to the light. On the other hand, we need to sometimes give the body and soul what they would like, otherwise tension is built. The way to happiness requires a lot of wisdom and inner sensitivity.

==The Way of Love==

'''The practice of love in daily life makes an individual fit through action, meditation and devotion to transcend the mind into the light.'''

1. '''Live in the rest (existence-unity-bliss)''' and act with love for the happiness of all beings. Follow the three principles of peace, wisdom and love. For some people it is important to live in the outer peace, to achieve the inner peace. Basically, the inner peace is the result of a calm mind. A calm mind we get when we focus in wisdom (God, Spirituality, Philosophy) and work continually on our negative qualities, addictions, fears and aggressions.

2. '''Everyone should find his personal balance of rest and action.''' Those who live in the inner balance, save their energy, their physical and mental health. Our mind grows into the light, if we strengthen not only the calmness, but also the positivity and the love in us. We should replace negative thoughts with positive thoughts. We should constantly practice positive thinking, positive speaking and positive doing.

3. '''When we facilitate the desire for a happy world, then we grow further towards enlightenment.''' The secret to this wish is the connection from the inner to the outer world. We are not spiritually separated from other beings. Their happiness affects us. When we visualize other beings as happy, then we also feel happy. Those who encourage the goal to a happy world creates positivity within. When we send light to all beings, then one day light will come through to our souls. When we do something good for the world, the world will reward us with a positive psyche.

4. '''We should make the inner happiness, not the outer happiness to the center of our lifes.''' If we follow the two principles of love for God (inner peace, spiritual practice) and love for all beings, we will transform our minds. Our inner tension will dissolve and happiness will appear.

5. '''With inner happiness, we can see the positive in the world, in our fellow men and in ourselves.  This is the way to paradise. We live in the light, in peace and in love.''' The longer we longer we practise, the more we grow into the light.

==Love Meditation==
[[File:Buddha der Liebe.jpg|thumb|200px|Buddha of Love (giving love and peace).]]
1. '''Universe.''' We visualize the whole universe, make circles with our arms and think, '''&quot;I wish a world of peace, love and happiness. My way of truth is ...&quot;'''

2. '''Television.''' What man on television today touches you negative or positive? Clean the energetic connection. Give him a positive sentence. Think the sentence as a mantra until you have overcome all attachment or rejection. Everything you see outside makes a knot in your soul. Create harmony in your mind. The first step to happiness is to create a positive world in your mind. We move a hand and send all the people light, '''&quot;I send light to ... May all people be happy. May the world be happy.&quot;'''

3. '''Buddha.''' We rub our hands before the heart chakra. We visualize ourselves as a Buddha or Bodhisattva, '''&quot;I am a Buddha (Bodhisattva, Goddess, Angel of Love). I go the way of love and peace.&quot;'''

4. '''Enlightened Masters.''' We rub the hands over our head and ask the enlightened masters for guidance and help. We connect us spiritually with their energy, '''&quot;Om all enlightened masters (Buddhas, Bodhisattvas). Please guide and help on my way.&quot;'''

5. '''Mantra.''' We put our hands together in the lap, move our feet and think one minute the mantra '''&quot;Om Shanti&quot; in our legs and in the whole world. We stop a minute every thought. We relax. We live in peace and become a Buddha or Bodhisattva (Master of Love) one day.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The use of a transportation network is highly dependent on the size and scale of the area it services.  While we can make on the surface observations about relationships between size and scale of cities to certain demographics, such as all towns above 10,000 are within driving distance of a super market, basic demographic comparisons such as this fall short of describing both generalized phenomena that occur on a national (or even international) level and fail to describe intrinsic, unique qualities that deviate from the norm.  The goal of this chapter is to introduce the reader to a few methods for determining and analyzing the size and scale of communities, explore one method to compare cities on a meaningful level, and to relate the size of a community to several demographic features.

== Introduction ==
The growth and expansion of cities is one of the most important occurrences in human history.  Living within close proximity to one another allows humans to exchange goods, services and ideas in ways that cannot just be explained through direct human communication. Even with modern communication, dynamics form within urban populations that aren't observed in rural or less densely populated communities. As the number of people increases, so does the amount of interaction between people, begetting both positive and negative consequences.  As human populations continue to grow and a greater percentage of population start to move into urban centers, as we are witnessing across the globe, these effects are becoming more prevalent than any other point in history.  While the United States has begun to produce a wide array of data on cities covering all aspects of society, it is difficult to make meaningful comparisons between cities due to the complexities of cities.  In order to find meaningful (missing part of sentence?)

This chapter will be broken up into three sections: one, how does scale pervade within our society and how does this affect transportation systems?; two, how do we remove scale from our measurements of urban populations and how can we make meaningful comparisons between cities of different sizes?; and three, how do cities grow and how do we categorize its growth?

== Power Law's and The Multiplicity Rule ==
=== Power Law ===
There are occurrences throughout nature that have relationships that can be dictated by the [[w:power law| power law]]. In relationships that can be described through the power law, the multiplicity of some element, whether it is in terms of number or size, decreases in a powered scale.  The relationship can be expressed in the following equation:

:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;px^m = C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Where p is the multiplicity of a given element, x is a characteristic scale size, m is the scaling exponent, and C is a normalized constant.  In general, relationships that can be described by the power law will have values of m ranging from 1 to 2.  If the log() is taken of this function, it reveals an important relationship:

:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;log(p) = -mlog(x) + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

On a log-log scale, this forms a linear relationship, with m denoting the negative slope of the function. Observation show that the slope of the function changes depending on the characteristics being observed.

=== Examples ===
The following are some examples of where the power law can be observed in nature, and its associated scaling exponent, m:

* If P is the probability to have an income of x, 1.5 &lt; m &lt; 2.0 (also known as a [[w:Pareto distribution| Pareto distribution]])
* If P is the relative frequency in the number of authors of a given number of papers, x, published in a year, m = 2
* If P is the number of cities with population x, m = 1
* If P is the number of animals and x is the mass weight of the animal, m = 1
* If P is the relative frequency of the usage of a word in a language and x is the rank of the word in the language, 1 &lt; m &lt; 1.5 (also known as [[w:Zipf's law| Zipf's Law]])

=== The Multiplicity Rule ===
In general, the number of instances where the power law can be used to describe is far greater than the number of observations we have made on the world we live in.  Therefore, as stated in Salingaros &amp; West's 1999 paper, nature follows what is called the multiplicity rule.  Simply put, our world is comprised of many scales, exhibiting a spectrum of scales with components relatively numbered in accordance to the power law.  When humans perceive objects with a &quot;full spectrum&quot; of scale, these seem aesthetically pleasing and natural.  When shown objects with quantized scaling, where some sizes are favored over others, these are found to be less aesthetically pleasing and artificial.  

One can look no further than their [[w:lego |Lego's]] to see an illustration of this rule.  Imagine you were trying to build your home, whether it was an apartment building or a house.  First, imagine using only 50 uniform blocks of the same color. How much detail could get with those fifty blocks? Can you differentiate easily between your doors, windows, roofing material, etc.? Most likely, the answer is that most of the elements of your home look roughly the same: it is difficult to distinguish between windows and doors, you cannot tell where there are medium changes, and it doesn't much feel like a place a human could live. This home not only doesn't look very realistic, but more importantly artificial and fake.  Now imagine building your home with 1,000 blocks, with an unlimited number of colors to choose from.  Assuming you played with Lego's as a kid, you probably built your home structure that closely resembles your building.  Not only were you able to re-size your windows and doors so that they were scaled appropriately, but the range of sizes could also be seen in the flower pots on the window sill to the shrubs in front yard to the ventilation system on the side.  While still a man-made structure (made with man-made blocks), the details and range of scales that can be seen make the structure more life like and natural.

The multiplicity rule can be applied to real life city applications.  While an analysis can be conducted to see the distribution of roads, buildings, project funding, etc., there are many other factors that could be identified as subjective qualities.  Furthermore, to compare the distribution funding of projects for a small city such as Mankato, MN to a large city such as New York City will not be a valid comparison: a &quot;small&quot; project for New York City will most likely not be a &quot;small&quot; project for Mankato.  Nonetheless, the multiplicity rule proves to be a powerful tool in determining the best course for policy: balanced cities that follow the multiplicity rule are those that follow the laws of nature that can be seen across numerous real life applications.  As it pertains to transportation, there are three circumstances highlighted by Salingaros and West that are in direct contradiction to the multiplicity rule, which create unbalanced systems within our urban transportation systems.

==== Distribution of Path Lengths/Widths ====
When planning for a city, one must consider both the hierarchy of roads and the distribution in accordance to the multiplicity rule.  While you couldn't imagine a city with only pedestrian walkways, the multiplicity rule is also violated when too much preference is given towards automobile arteries.  Balanced cities are able to give preference to bipedal, bicycle and low-flow streets in terms of millage, but also enable car travel to occur through both middle to high flow streets to enter the city.

The most notable violators of the multiplicity rule are suburban housing projects.  In many cases, the only way to enter these developments are through medium to high flow roads.  Ultimately, this leads to a disconnect between the suburb and the city it is attached to, since it doesn't include the lower spectrum paths for human travel.  Conversely, some inner city neighborhoods lack the major arterial to connect to and only have lower function roads, ultimately disconnecting them from the greater part of the city.

==== Distribution of Project Funding ====
If given a choice between large projects that make a substantial change to several neighborhoods or a city versus many small changes over the course of a decade to slowly changing the make up of the city, more often or not the large project will receive funding over the smaller ones.  Unfortunately, studies show that the optimal way to distribute funding for projects is equally over all sizes of projects.  How this relates with the multiplicity rule is to have numerous small projects that do minor changes, such as road maintenance or small facility restoration, fewer medium size projects, then only a couple of large projects.  When public policies choose to fund more larger projects that reinvent the city and pull funding from smaller projects, infrastructure can become dilapidated and the city can begin to decay in places that do not see the effects of the large project.

==== Distribution of Urban Elements ====
As described earlier through the Lego's example, there must be an even distribution of sizes and scales throughout the cities fabric.  This can be related to either the size of buildings, where we would hope to see a few sky scrapers, several medium size office and commercial buildings, and numerous smaller residential buildings.  Not only does this apply to buildings, but city elements like parks, where there should be both a few large fields, a fair number of trees, but many human sized scale elements such as benches.  Unlike the previous two examples that apply towards functionality, this application of the multiplicity principle applies towards the human perception of scale and what is determined to be &quot;natural.&quot;  

One way that suburban sprawl is sometimes deemed unnatural is its preference to using cookie cutter design: where all the buildings are approximately the same size, their lot sizes are uniform, and the roads are of the same design, creating a gap in the spectrum in scale that is required from the multiplicity rule.  Conversely, with the newly developing cities in China, there are many cities opting to build high rise buildings instead of lower density, human size scaled buildings, putting too much emphasis on the other end of the scale.

== Measurements Independent of Size ==
As described earlier, a difficult problem arises when we try to compare cities of drastically different sizes such as Mankato, MN and New York City: the size and scale of the cities are just so drastically different, on the onset it seems to be finding similarities to a golf ball to a beach ball. At the root of the problem, there are two main causes.  The first is attempting to find scale free indicators.  A common practice is to compare cities on a &quot;per capita&quot; basis, where each individual is assigned a contribution to the aggregated city value.  While this does allow us to compare very small places to very large ones in terms of assigning a value to every individual, this doesn't tell us the whole story, as illustrated by the second problem. As a city grows and becomes more densely populated, an interesting phenomena occurs within the city.  People begin to interact more frequently with others, causing each person to become more productive within the place they live.  Not only can this be seen in conventional figures such as [[w:GDP |GDP]], but in other socioeconomic factors such as wages, number of patents, even crime and the spread of certain diseases.  So even if we were to see a larger GDP per capita in a certain city, it only scratches the surface as to what makes the city more or less productive than the average city.  We will explore the additive effect of these interactions, designated the Fifteen Percent Rule, then compare two scale free indicators: per capita and the Scale Adjusted Metropolitan Indicator developed by Bettencourt et al. in their 2010 paper 'Urban Scaling and Its Deviations.'

=== The Fifteen Percent Rule ===
As one can imagine, when organisms work together, they can do more work than they could have individually.  When applies to larger scales, it is observed that growth in many socioeconomic factors does not grow linearly with population: when a population doubles, it is able to produce more than double the goods, services and ideas.  For every doubling in population, roughly a 115% increase in socioeconomic activities (GDP, wages, crime, etc) is observed.  Furthermore, less resources are required as a population grows more dense: for every doubling in population, there needs to be a 85% increase in infrastructure development as the effects of [[w:economies of scale | economies of scale]]. The following is a short list of some advantageous and disadvantageous factors that this rule is seen to apply to:

Advantageous:
* GDP (or Gross Metropolitan Product (GMP))
* Increase number of patents
* Increase number of research institutions
* Increase number of education institutions
* Decrease in energy needs (electricity, gasoline, etc.)
* Decrease in infrastructure needs

Disadvantageous:
* Increase in crime
* Increase in traffic congestion
* Increase in number of illnesses

Not only does this rule apply to large cities, it applies to all communities and shows similar increases to those seen in cities with similar cultural and/or geographical characteristics. This principle can be expressed by the following equation:

:&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt; Y(t)= Y_0 N(t)^{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Where,
:&lt;math&gt;Y(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a quantity of a socioeconomic urban quality (i.e. wages, GMP, crime, etc.)
:&lt;math&gt;Y_0&lt;/math&gt; is normalized constant
:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is the time at which we are observing the quality
:&lt;math&gt;N(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the population at time t
:β is the scaling factor

The scaling factor,β, controls the effect we observe. When β = 1, there is a linear relationship between population and quality: “per capita” measurement is adequate as the quality grows at the same rate as population.  When β ≠ 1, observed in most real life applications, there are changing rates due to population increases:
* β ≈ 0.85 implies economies of scale
* β ≈ 1.15 implies increasing rates

=== Per Capita ===
&lt;small&gt;''For alternative definition, please view the Wikipedia page:''[[w:Per_capita|Per Capita]]&lt;/small&gt;

To compare cities on a per capita basis is to compare a specific quality or trait of a city on a per person basis.  In terms of the above equation, β must equal 1, to which we can rearrange the equation in the following manner:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{Y(t)}{N(t)} = Y_0&lt;/math&gt;

This implies that at any given time, ''t'', some quality will have be constant value over time.  Unfortunately, this goes against what is observed: either economies of scale decrease the overall number of resources needed per unit of population, or the increased interactions produce higher productivity per person as populations grow.  In other words, we would not expect a quality ''Y'' to grow linearly over time with respect to population.

=== Scale Adjusted Metropolitan Indicator (SAMI) ===
Due to the limited applicability of a per capita measurement with respect to time, Bettencourt et al. (2010) developed a means of comparing cities not only for a scale free measurement, but on how they compare in growth over time.  The unit of measurement they developed are Scale Adjusted Metropolitan Indicators (SAMIs).  SAMI's are derived by the following equation:

&lt;math&gt;{\xi}_i = Log(\frac{Y_i}{Y_{0}N_{i}^{\beta}})&lt;/math&gt;

Where,
:&lt;math&gt;{\xi}_i&lt;/math&gt; is the SAMI for quality i
:&lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt; is the average metric from a city
:&lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;Y_{0}N_{i}^{\beta}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt; is the expected metric from a city with population &lt;math&gt;N_{i}&lt;/math&gt;

As you can see, it is a unitless number that removes population from the indicator.  Furthermore, it finds the deviation from the norm by taking the observed metric, &lt;math&gt;Y_i&lt;/math&gt;, and dividing it by the expected value with a given population.  SAMI's allow for more meaningful comparisons on whether a city is developing socioeconomical characteristics at an increased or decreased rate with respect to other cities. [http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~bettencourt/urban_observatory/ Click here] for their interactive maps and their rankings for cities across the United States for four characteristics.

== Size Characteristics ==
Across cities with similar characteristics historically, geographically and/or economically, one can use SAMI's to indicate how cities relate to one another as they grow in population.  While we can expand the analysis from comparing cities within the same country, such as what Bettencourt et al. did in their 2010 paper, there are many factors that come into play beyond the scope of SAMI's due to various other factors.  For example, when comparing cities across the United States, even though the variations are limited, cities can be grouped based on previous industries: the rust belt cities are very similar in growth patterns, and will vary significantly from other cities in growth geographically similar to them.  Of course, expanding this on a world scale will introduce further problems; there are many fewer things that San Francisco has in common with somewhere such as Moscow than it did for a place such as Baltimore.  One characteristic that makes a considerable difference when comparing two cities is its density, especially when thinking of topics previous presented in this chapter.

=== Density ===
As explained earlier, as the number of human interactions increases, the productivity increases and resources are able to be used more efficiently; economies of scale develop and infrastructure is able to be better utilized by the population.  When a population grows within the metropolitan area serviced by a city, by definition the density of the population increases as well. A notable exception is when the serviced area grows with expanding suburbs and pushing the extent of the city.  By expanding the city limits through expansion, this hinders economies of scale from developing and requires greater resources.  One of the most notable examples of greater resource usage is gasoline consumption, as presented in Newman &amp; Kenworthy’s article 'Gasoline Consumption and Cities' presented in 1989.

==== Newman and Kenworthy's Findings ====
In their 1989 article presented in Journal of the American Planning Association, Newman and Kenworthy made two comparisons: one, comparing United States cities to one another based on density, and secondly developing a model based on worldwide gasoline consumption and comparing United States cities to different regions of the world, determining how certain factors attributed to gasoline consumption.  When comparing United States cities, cities with a developed Central Business District (CBD), high density living and relatively high public transportation (e.g. New York and Chicago) consumed considerably less gasoline than cities with low population densities (e.g. Houston and Los Angeles).

When they developed a model to predict gasoline consumption, a correlation was discovered between gasoline consumption and density not only within the CBD, but also within the outer suburban areas.  This phenomenon emphasizes that it isn’t simply a strong CBD that promotes economies of scale, but increased activity within suburban areas also makes a considerable impact.  One example that Newman and Kenworhty bring up is the city of Toronto, which has a similar percentage of jobs in the CBD (13% compared to 12% in American cities), has the same average commute (8.1 miles), but consumes 60% as much gasoline due to higher densities in the outlying areas from the CBD and higher transit ridership.  Overall, the factor that contributed most towards gasoline usage was the average commuting distance, where the United States’ average was 8.1 miles, compared to 5.0 for European cities, and 2.5 miles in Asian cities.  Unsurprisingly, American gasoline consumption (in 1980) was at 446 gallons per capita when compared to 101 for European cities, and 42 for Asian cities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As companies become more globalized and technologically advanced, the need to identify Key Intelligence Topics (or KITs) becomes increasingly important for companies to survive.  Companies are no longer dealing with local entry threats or local suppliers, but now face competition from firms in other countries around the world.  Because of this globalization, the landscape has become extremely competitive with companies shifting focus to products, services and customer satisfaction.  Evidence of this globalization can be seen over the last 50 years in the United States as the American automotive companies have been slowly overtaken by Japanese and European automakers, or in technology such as televisions and appliances.

The first step for firms to identify their KITs is through information gathering.  The information gathered can be used for: strategic planning, possible mergers and acquisitions, new market decisions, pricing decisions, etc.  Organizations have different ways of gathering information to define their KITs. For example, some companies such as AT&amp;T and Pfizer have their own Strategy Departments which gather information through surveys, trade publications, analyst reports and database searches.  Other companies, such as Kraft, have strategic departments within their Marketing Departments, these departments use public information in magazines and news papers to fill define KITs. While, still other companies, such as General Mills train their employees on competitive intelligence and gathers information through employee focus groups where data is gathered, organized and analyzed.  Though the methods to define and analyze KITs may differ from company to company, the commonality in all of this is that they require management backing and support to operate.  Without the full support of management, CI departments would not have the needed funds or power to operate successfully.

Once KIT information is gathered, they must be categorized to allow for proper analysis and presentation to management. The most common KIT categories are: 

- Strategic KITs 

- Early Warning KITs 

- Key Player KITs.

'''Strategic KITs''' contribute to key decisions in relation to strategic formulations and implementation for the company.  Strategic KITs are used to make determine on actions such as:  investment decisions, global expansion, technological competitiveness, global alliances and/or acquisitions.

'''Early Warning KITs''' identify forthcoming threats and opportunities for the company in the market.  Some examples of Early Warning KITs include: new entrant threats, government regulations, untapped market, and any shifts in bargaining power.

'''Key Player KITs''' arise from market rivalries, new entrants, and substitute products.  However, Key Player KITs can also deal with none threatening means such as new suppliers or contractors which have entered the market as well.

Though information is placed in one of the three KIT categories, they do not operate independently of one another.  There is an interrelationship that exists linking each of the three KITs.  For example, the presence of an Early Warning KIT (new government regulation) may result in management looking into Strategic KITs (plan to counter / comply regulations), which may result in reviewing Key Player KITs as part of the strategy to form new alliances (contracting with lobbyists).  Another example would be the presence of a Key Player KIT (new supplier), which results in an Early Warning KIT (possible new contract) and becomes a Strategic KIT (contract to lower cost and increase market share).

Looking at the three KIT categories, the majority of the world places more emphasis on Strategic and Early Warning KITs, while Key Players KITs are lower on the rankings. The emphasis on Strategic and Early Warning KITs could be attributed to the competitive nature of global market where foreign firms entering into new markets may threaten the incumbents’ market shares.  However, the United States and North America employ Key Players and Strategic KITs, while Early Warning KITs less emphasized. The emphasis of North American companies on Key Players and Strategic KITs is reflexive of a strong sales culture, competitive market and entrepreneurial culture. 

An example of using KITs in a global business is the entry of the KFC fast food restaurant’s dominant immergence in China as the most successful fast food chain in China.  In the United States, KFC ranks 6th among fast food chains to giant McDonalds in a 2009 ranking .  However, in China “Colonel Harland Sander’s image is a far more common sight in many Chinese cities than that of Mao” . 

The Yum! Brand Company can be seen as one that has the use of KITs to move it into this new market.  The use of Key Player and Strategic KITs are combined in this situation as the success of KFC is through the use of these KITs.  One of KFC’s key players is the local management team used to work on their franchises.  With the American brand being operated by Chinese locals, the flavor and the appeal of the restaurant can be better tailored to the culture.  Also, the strategy of using cultural flavors in their ingredients rather than using the traditional flavors famous in America helps to win the locals over, rather than forcing them to like the American version of the famous chicken.

      <comment>/* Sustainable Use of Natural Resources */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
“Do volunteers do more harm than good?”

Any self-reflective and sensitive volunteer should take time to contemplate the question, “does my service do more harm than good to the community I am serving?”  In addition to the cultural questions of empowering the local population to sustain the changes and improvements that you envision, a perceptive volunteer must determine whether the cost of these changes, in both the depletion of resources and the increase in the local carbon footprint, are justifiable and sustainable.  In the past, some have criticized international volunteerism by describing it as “invasions, conquests, and colonialism.” In far too many instances, host populations have suffered more from the negative effects than have benefited from the positive ones of volunteering because too often volunteers have used an excessive amount of natural resources that the country clearly cannot sustain.  It is more profitable, as well as efficient and sustainable, for communities to employ local people to plant trees, build houses, educate the youth and administer health clinics.  The local people have an appreciation and sensitivity, not only for the local customs and practices, but for the scarcity and value of local resources. For volunteers, the most important resource is the local people.  Utilize them to help identify resources, reduce waste and maintain the smallest carbon footprint possible.  Whatever the service you are performing, insuring that your presence is felt only in a positive manner of empowering the local community is the goal.  Disregard for the value of resources, leaving behind unacceptable waste and having an attitude that implies you “know best” only reinforces the negative stereotypes of volunteers and does not forge new sustainable and culturally sensitive relationships.

==Air Travel==

Traveling to any other country besides Mexico or Canada from the United States almost always means you will book a flight. While flying is certainly the most efficient method of travel in terms of time management, airplanes are extremely harmful to the earth and greatly accelerate global warming, according to an article in the Christian Science Monitor.

In 2007, aircraft contributed three percent of the total emissions that exacerbate the detrimental conditions of the atmosphere. While this seems to be a trivial amount, the reality is more and more people are traveling by air, an annual increase of about five percent. If the trend continues, Boeing reported the number of airplanes will likely double by 2020 to meet passenger demand.
One of the chief reasons aircraft negatively impact the environment is their proximity to the atmosphere. Airplanes emit not only carbon dioxide, the common pollutant associated with climate change, but nitrous oxide, which is believed to be twice as harmful as carbon dioxide.

The environmental consequences of air travel are well known and before committing to fly, it is helpful to think about your purpose for traveling and what you think of the impacts involved. Will the work or activities you do abroad justify the environmental cost of the flight?

I attended a workshop where participants examined their own consumption of resources a couple years ago. Toward the end of the day, the facilitator explained his personal dilemma with leading the workshop. He is a professional speaker and flies all over the U.S. often discussing the issue of climate change in large hotel conference rooms. People often drive to participate in his workshops. He asked if this was all worth it: the energy consumed by hotels that provide a meeting space, the pollution from the cars people used to get to the hotel, and, of course, the emissions from the plane he took to get there. These consequences all occur in order for people to become more aware about their impact on the environment. Is it worth it?

==Reducing Emissions==

The means you use to get to your travel destination are, of course, only the beginning of your trip’s energy consumption. The travel website Green Passport points out that, like choosing transportation, your other choices about where you stay, what you eat, and what you do will be the significant determinant of how your adventure impacts the planet. One of the best ways to make such choices is to consider steps you can take to reduce carbon emissions.
Some suggestions: research transportation and accommodation options that utilize sustainable practices. Look into how climate change impacts the specific region you plan to visit. Different ecosystems, elevations, proximity to the ocean etc. will be effected in their own ways by global warming. Although it is heavily promoted and encouraged here in the Northwest the reasons still apply abroad: eat local food! Consuming local meals and, for that matter, buying local crafts or supplies counts toward reducing overall carbon emissions for your trip, because the food and other goods were not flown from hundreds of miles away.

==Sustainable Use of Natural Resources==
&quot;Resource efficiency means using a country’s limited resources in a sustainable manner&quot;. Our resource uses in foreign countries have impacts on the environment and can result in serious consequences for the country. For example, coming from the United States, we are used to the abundance of water that allows us to take long, hot showers. Overseas, you might not have that same luxury. When you take a shower in developing countries, their limited supply of resources only allows them to offer you a bucket full of the same water they drink and cook with. An alternative way to take a shower that is a sustainable use of natural resources may be limiting the amount of bucket baths you take during your stay. Countries depend on their resources for the survival of its population and to keep its economy functioning. It is perfectly possible to produce more value with fewer resources, to lessen our impact on a country’s environment and to reduce cost in its economy. Also, a wiser use of resources reduces greenhouse gas emissions and many other environmental and health problems. Small changes make a big difference in reducing your carbon footprint in a foreign country. For example, reduce, re-use, and recycle are some of the simplest ways to decrease your carbon footprint.
&lt;br /&gt;

Spending time abroad can provide you with a new way to think about using resources. Being in Kenya for a six week period definitely made me more aware of the scarcity and preciousness of water. One day, our group of students from Western joined with a local school and a community-based organization to go out in the village and clean the some houses belonging to widows. As part of the cleaning process, we collected their clothes so we could wash them. This process looks much different in rural Kenya than it does the United States. It involves filling buckets with water and using your hands to scrub the garments clean. When my group tried to accomplish this, I realized how difficult obtaining water can be. A large group of us were gathered around the water pump, trying to get it to work. When the pump failed to provide us with any water, we had to locate water elsewhere. Many of us used the rainwater that had gathered in the ditch beside the road. By showing me a glimpse of the dangers of water scarcity, this moment really showed me how invaluable water is. When traveling, especially to areas suffering from drought, it is really important to be aware of their access to resources and to be sensitive to the local ecosystems.

==Local Economy==

When studying abroad, it is important to consider how your spending choices will affect the local economy. Discussing food economy is a good model as to why your choices may have such a large impact. The industrialization of agriculture has changed the focus from quality to quantity. Large-scale, monoculture farming is becoming more widespread as mass production, marketing, and processing is desired primarily for export. As mass production has increased, many consequences have arisen such as increased chemical usage, decreased need for human labor, and the increasing distance between food producers and food consumers.

There is a huge disparity between the place of production and the place of consumption of our foods. For example, in the United States food travels an average 1,300 miles to our plates. This model of agricultural distribution has resulted in overall decreased income for farm income as a larger cut of money is required for processing, packing, storage, and distribution. The distance between producer and consumer has resulted in the loss of environmental accountability and connection between the farmer and the public. Little communication can travel over this distance, so consumers have little knowledge about the process of producing their food and remain unaware of the environmental and health impacts it may have.

Take an interest in learning about where your food comes from. Use local people as resources to learn how to support the local economy. By connecting directly with the farmers growing our food, environmental accountability and knowledge of what we are putting into our bodies increases. You will putting money into the farmers whose faces you recognize, not anonymous people from thousands of miles away. Do what you can to preserve the livelihood of local farm families and communities. 


==Carbon Footprint==
In our everyday lives, we each contribute to the greenhouse gas emissions and accumulation in these gases in the atmosphere that are causing climate change. Individuals can produce greenhouse gas emissions directly or indirectly, and you may not even be aware how much of an impact you are making in your daily routine. Personal habits and choices, the mode of transportation you use, the kinds of foods you eat, and how much you recycle are all considered when calculating your carbon footprint.

[[File:World map of countries by ecological footprint (2007).svg|World map of countries by ecological footprint (2007)]]
World map of countries shaded according to their ecological footprint in 2007 (published on 13 October 2010 by the Global Footprint Network). It is measured by the amount of global hectares that are affected by humans per capita of the country. Lighter shades denote countries with a lower ecological footprint per capita and darker shaded for countries with a higher ecological footprint per capita. The total ecological footprint (global hectares affected by humans) is measured as a total of six factors: cropland footprint, grazing footprint, forest footprint, fishing ground footprint, carbon footprint and built-up land.

When we travel, our individual impact increases when considering the transportation required in reaching our destinations and our unfamiliarity of how to reduce our carbon emissions in our new environment. Remember that our individual choices in where we live, what we eat, and how we manage our waste has an impact on our carbon footprint. When in an area you are unaccustomed to, it is difficult to consider these details when you are not sure what the customs are. For this reason, it is important to become acquainted with local residents and learn from them.

==Calculate Your Carbon Footprint==

The links below are for different carbon footprint calculators. You may also visit the homepage for the different organizations if you want to learn more about carbon emissions and climate change.

http://www.carbonfootprint.com/calculator.aspx

http://www.nature.org/greenliving/carboncalculator/

http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/emissions/ind_calculator.html

http://www.myfootprint.org/

http://www.safeclimate.net/calculator/

After you calculate your own carbon footprint, take a moment to reflect on ways you could reduce your impact on the global climate. Think of small goals that are within reach. Instead of driving to school, could you walk or take the bus? Consider using the stairs instead of the elevator. Could you designate one day a week to not use your car? Maybe consider a vegetarian diet a few days a week. There are many little changes you could make in your life that can reduce your individual carbon footprint.

==Questions==
These questions are posed to you as a way to encourage reflection. You may find you can't settle on one answer. 
What impact is your trip going to have on the earth?
Does the amount of emissions/energy expended by your trip affect you in any way?
How mindful will you choose to be about carbon emissions on your trip? Before and after your trip?
What connections do you see between resource use and poverty?
What will you do to reduce carbon emissions?

Sou mais um dos que crêem no espetáculo da vida e na decantação lenta dos problemas.



Em você a razão de ser poeta.


A vida mescla o tempo que se fundi com a matéria, conferindo

a há existência horária, de momentos, etapas que nem sempre vejo ou entendo,

por outras vezes por ver e entender. Desse desconforto uma energia explode

em versos que chamo de poesia, que na história vem se repetindo e sendo modificada

por muitos. Onde algumas vezes poetas escalonam metricamente e até impõe regras

onde eles expõem tais sentimentos e visões. Embora quebre por varias vezes regras,

me dedico em “Sonetos”, forma bem explicada aqui na Wikipédia, com nomes que nos

lembra de momentos esplêndidos, que nos remete Luiz Vaz de Camões ou o

brasileiríssimo e eterno Cônsul, Vinícius de Morais. Por razões familiares

assino Kiko Pardini, mas aqui inicio como Kiko58 que foi assim que se deu

meu registro. Um abraço e como já disse Raul Seixas em parceria

com Paulo Coelho....&quot;boa viagem&quot;...

&lt;br/&gt;Em você a razão de ser poeta.&lt;br/&gt;


&lt;br/&gt;A vida mescla o tempo que se fundi com a matéria, conferindo&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;a há existência horária, de momentos, etapas que nem sempre vejo ou entendo,&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;por outras vezes por ver e entender. Desse desconforto uma energia explode&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;em versos que chamo de poesia, que na história vem se repetindo e sendo modificada&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;por muitos. Onde algumas vezes poetas escalonam metricamente e até impõe regras&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;onde eles expõem tais sentimentos e visões. Embora quebre por varias vezes regras,&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;me dedico em “Sonetos”, forma bem explicada aqui na Wikipédia, com nomes que nos&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;lembra de momentos esplêndidos, que nos remete Luiz Vaz de Camões ou o&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;brasileiríssimo e eterno Cônsul, Vinícius de Morais. Por razões familiares&lt;br/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I added pro-life as the list seems heavily representative of generally leftist, liberal or progressive SMs.  An objective analysis of the pro-life movement would include it in this list.  I avoided using anti-choice since the other examples seem to be in the language the activists use, e.g. gay rights instead of gay agenda.  I did not find  a link to a wikibooks chapter on the pro-life movement per se.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Health Perception and management==
The principle of wellness has been ingrained in nursing theory since Dorothea Orem published her work on self care. The nurses perception of the clients health status and the clients perception of their own health are not identical. For example, the client may have been born with a major disability but regard this as normal for them. Consequently some clients seek nursing attention far more or less readily than health professionals might expect.

Health management refers to the clients behavior in relation to their own health. Some clients will seek nursing attention at the slightest excuse because they view health issues with great concern. Other clients at the other end of the extreme will avoid nursing attention at all cost (e.g. clients with paranoid tendencies will regard health assessment as invasive). The bulk of nursing contacts will be in between these extremes, but clients health-seeking behavior needs to be respected throughout the nursing relationship.

The first contact between nurse and client is often during the initial interview when the nurse will obtain a history from the client and collateral data from other sources such as relatives, existing records and allied agencies. The following questions could be asked by the nurse to provide an overview of the individuals subjective health history and health practices that are used to reach the current level of health or wellness. Generally well? Regular exercise? Any absences from work/school? Important things to keep healthy? Use drugs (eg Caffeine, nicotine) Perform self exams at intervals i.e. Breast/testicular self-examination? Accidents?  What do you think caused current illness? Why have you asked for an assessment? What actions have you taken since symptoms started? Does anything alleviate the symptom or make it worse?

A client with optimal health seeking behavior will take steps to maintain their own health status, such as safe sex practices, personal protective equipment, retire early to bed and so on. A more specific health assessment is used to pinpoint the nature and extent of the clients complaint once an initial impression has been formed. Then the nurse can ask more probing questions and collect objective data relevant to the disturbed functional health pattern.

==Principles for prioritizing care==
Nola Pender is synonymous with nursing care of populations and her theory underpins the practice of nursing in primary care settings such as health promotion, public health and community care roles.

One way of organizing care is to order priority by principles of '''justice''', which goes something like this.

* Principle one :All the nursing resources available should be distributed to clients except where this impinges on principle two and principle three
* Principle two :The available nursing resources should be distributed to clients who request it, except where this impinges on principle three
* Principle three: All the nursing resources available should be distributed to clients who need it.&lt;br /&gt;

In the acute clinical  setting, many nurses will be delivering care to groups of clients whom they come to know personally and the priority becomes more individual: usually by assigning '''acuity'''. Acuity can be a subjective or digitally scored system for assigning the amount of nursing the clients require. In other words a means   of guaging whether a client group is more or less sick than usual for the conditions. Some organizations have elaborate computer software programs for tallying acuity predictions to help manage staffing.

Another system for deciding care priority is the '''triage''' scale. In some settings the triage scale is used to decide how long the client can wait without injury. Triage can also be used to decide whether the client requires nursing care or collaborative care with another health professional, such as a physiotherapist or continence advisor. Most countries use a triage scale with degree of urgency ranging from least urgent for primary care issues such as recurrent treatment for known conditions (eg. dressing) to most urgent, such as cardiac arrest.

(where &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{s}}&lt;/math&gt; is the supply voltage and the opamp is powered by &lt;math&gt;+V_{\text{s}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-V_{\text{s}}&lt;/math&gt;.)

| Inverting amplifier || [[Image:Op-Amp Inverting Amplifier.svg|300px]] || An inverting amplifier uses negative feedback to invert and [[amplifier|amplify]] a voltage. The R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; resistor allows some of the output signal to be returned to the input.  Since the output is 180° out of phase, this  amount is effectively subtracted from the input, thereby reducing the input into the operational amplifier.  This reduces the overall gain of the amplifier and is dubbed negative feedback.&lt;ref&gt;Basic Electronics Theory, Delton T. Horn, 4th ed. McGraw-Hill Professional, 1994, p.342-343.&lt;/ref&gt;  

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = -\frac{R_{\text{f}}}{R_{\text{in}}} V_{\text{in}}\!\ &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}} = R_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; (because &lt;math&gt;V_-&lt;/math&gt; is a [[virtual ground]])
* A third resistor, of value &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{f}} \| R_{\text{in}} \triangleq R_{\text{f}} R_{\text{in}} / (R_{\text{f}} + R_{\text{in}}) &lt;/math&gt;, added between the non-inverting input and ground, while not necessary, minimizes errors due to input bias currents.&lt;ref&gt;Malmstadt, Enke and Crouch, Electronics and Instrumentation for Scientists, The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company, Inc., 1981, ISBN 0-8053-6917-1, Chapter 5. pp 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

The gain of the amplifier is determined by the ratio of R&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; to R&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;.  That is:

&lt;math&gt;A = -\frac{R_f}{R_{in}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Non-inverting amplifier || [[Image:Op-Amp Non-Inverting Amplifier.svg|300px]] ||

Amplifies a voltage (multiplies by a constant greater than 1)

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = V_{\text{in}} \left( 1 + \frac{R_2}{R_1} \right)\,&lt;/math&gt;
* Input impedance &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}} \approx \infin&lt;/math&gt; 
** The input impedance is ''at least'' the impedance between non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) and inverting (&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;) inputs, which is typically 1 MΩ to 10 TΩ, plus the impedance of the path from the inverting (&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;) input to ground (i.e., &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;).
** Because negative feedback ensures that the non-inverting and inverting inputs match, the input impedance is actually '''much higher.'''
* Although this circuit has a large input impedance, it suffers from error of input bias current.
** The non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) and inverting (&lt;math&gt;-&lt;/math&gt;) inputs draw small leakage currents into the operational amplifier.
** These input currents generate voltages that act like unmodeled input offsets. These unmodeled effects can lead to noise on the output (e.g., offsets or drift).
** Assuming that the two leaking currents are '''matched,''' their effect can be mitigated by ensuring the DC impedance looking '''out''' of each input is the same.
*** The voltage produced by each bias current is equal to the product of the bias current with the equivalent DC impedance looking out of each input. Making those impedances equal makes the offset voltage at each input equal, and so the non-zero bias currents will have no impact on the '''difference''' between the two inputs.
*** A resistor of value
***:&lt;math&gt;R_1 \| R_2 \triangleq \left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}\right)^{-1} = \frac{ R_1 R_2 }{ R_1 + R_2 },\,&lt;/math&gt;
**:which is the equivalent resistance of &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, between the &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; source and the non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) input will ensure the impedances looking '''out''' of each input will be matched.
*** The matched bias currents will then generate matched offset voltages, and their effect will be hidden to the operational amplifier (which acts on the difference between its inputs) so long as the [[common-mode rejection ratio|CMRR]] is good.
** Very often, the input currents are ''not'' matched.
*** Most operational amplifiers provide some method of balancing the two input currents (e.g., by way of an external [[potentiometer]]).
*** Alternatively, an external offset can be added to the operational amplifier input to nullify the effect.
*** Another solution is to insert a variable resistor between the &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; source and the non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) input. The resistance can be tuned until the offset voltages at each input are matched.
*** Operational amplifiers with [[MOSFET]]-based input stages have input currents that are so small that they often can be neglected.

| Differential amplifier || [[Image:Op-Amp Differential Amplifier.svg|300px]] || The circuit shown is used for finding the [[subtraction|difference]] of two voltages each multiplied by some constant (determined by the resistors). 

''The name &quot;differential amplifier&quot; should not be confused with the &quot;[[#Differentiator|differentiator]]&quot;, also shown on this page.''

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = \frac{ \left( R_{\text{f}} + R_1 \right) R_{\text{g}} }{\left( R_{\text{g}} + R_2 \right) R_1} V_2 - \frac{R_{\text{f}}}{R_1} V_1 &lt;/math&gt;

* Differential &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; (between the two input pins) = &lt;math&gt;R_1 + R_2&lt;/math&gt; (Note: this is approximate)

For common-mode rejection, anything done to one input must be done to the other.  The addition of a compensation capacitor in parallel with Rf, for instance, must be balanced by an equivalent capacitor in parallel with Rg.

''The &quot;[[#Instrumentation amplifier|instrumentation amplifier]]&quot;, which is also shown on this page, is another form of differential amplifier that also provides high [[input impedance]].''

Whenever &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_2\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{f}} = R_{\text{g}}\,&lt;/math&gt;, the differential gain is
:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = A (V_{\text{2}} - V_{\text{1}})\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp; and &amp;nbsp; &lt;math&gt;A \triangleq \frac{ R_{\text{f}} }{ R_1 }&lt;/math&gt;

When &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_\mathrm{f}\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2 = R_\mathrm{g}\,&lt;/math&gt; the differential gain is A = 1 and the circuit acts as a differential follower:

:&lt;math&gt; V_\mathrm{out} =  V_2 - V_1 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|Voltage follower || [[Image:Op-Amp Unity-Gain Buffer.svg|200px]] || Used as a [[buffer amplifier]] to eliminate loading effects (e.g., connecting a device with a high [[source impedance]] to a device with a low [[input impedance]]). 

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = V_{\text{in}} \!\ &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{in}} = \infty&lt;/math&gt; (realistically, the differential input impedance of the op-amp itself, 1 MΩ to 1 TΩ)

Due to the strong (i.e., [[unity (mathematics)|unity]] gain) feedback and certain non-ideal characteristics of real operational amplifiers, this feedback system is prone to have poor [[phase margin|stability margin]]s. Consequently, the system may be [[BIBO stability|unstable]] when connected to sufficiently capacitive loads. In these cases, a [[frequency compensation|lag compensation]] network (e.g., connecting the load to the voltage follower through a resistor) can be used to restore stability. The manufacturer [[data sheet]] for the operational amplifier may provide guidance for the selection of components in external compensation networks. Alternatively, another operational amplifier can be chosen that has more appropriate internal compensation.
|-
|Summing amplifier || [[Image:Op-Amp Summing Amplifier.svg|left|200px]] || A summing amplifer sums several (weighted) voltages:

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = -R_{\text{f}} \left( \frac{V_1}{R_1} + \frac{V_2}{R_2} + \cdots + \frac{V_n}{R_n} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

* When &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_2 = \cdots = R_n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_{\text{f}}&lt;/math&gt; independent

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = -\frac{R_{\text{f}}}{R_1} ( V_1 + V_2 + \cdots + V_n ) \!\ &lt;/math&gt;

* When &lt;math&gt;R_1 = R_2 = \cdots = R_n = R_{\text{f}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; V_{\text{out}} = -( V_1 + V_2 + \cdots + V_n ) \!\ &lt;/math&gt; 
* Output is inverted
* Input impedance of the '''''n''th''' input is &lt;math&gt;Z_n = R_n&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;V_-&lt;/math&gt; is a [[virtual ground]])
|-
|Inverting integrator || [[Image:Op-Amp Integrating Amplifier.svg|300px|]] || [[Integral|Integrates]] the (inverted) signal over time

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = -\int_0^t \frac{ V_{\text{in}} }{RC} \, \operatorname{d}t + V_{\text{initial}}\,&lt;/math&gt;

(where &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}}&lt;/math&gt; are functions of time, &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{initial}}&lt;/math&gt; is the output voltage of the integrator at time ''t'' = 0.)

* Note that this can also be viewed as a [[Low-pass filter|low-pass]] [[electronic filter]]. It is a filter with a single [[complex pole|pole]] at DC (i.e., where &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;) and gain.
* There are several potential problems with this circuit.
** It is usually assumed that the input &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; has zero DC component (i.e., has a zero average value). Otherwise, unless the capacitor is periodically discharged, the output will drift outside of the operational amplifier's operating range.
** Even when &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; has no offset, the leakage or bias currents into the operational amplifier inputs can add an unexpected offset voltage to &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; that causes the output to drift. Balancing input currents '''and''' replacing the non-inverting (&lt;math&gt;+&lt;/math&gt;) short-circuit to ground with a resistor with resistance &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; can reduce the severity of this problem.
** Because this circuit provides no DC feedback (i.e., the capacitor appears like an open circuit to signals with &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;), the offset of the output may not agree with expectations (i.e., &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{initial}}&lt;/math&gt; may be out of the designer's control with the present circuit). 
: Many of these problems can be made less severe by adding a ''large'' resistor &lt;math&gt;R_F&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with the feedback capacitor. At significantly high frequencies, this resistor will have negligible effect. However, at low frequencies where there are drift and offset problems, the resistor provides the necessary feedback to hold the output steady at the correct value. In effect, this resistor reduces the DC gain of the &quot;integrator&quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; it goes from infinite to some finite value &lt;math&gt;R_F/R&lt;/math&gt;.
|-
|Inverting differentiator || [[Image:Op-Amp Differentiating Amplifier.svg|300px]] || [[Derivative|Differentiates]] the (inverted) signal over time.  

:&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = -RC \,\frac{\operatorname{d}V_{\text{in}} }{ \operatorname{d}t} \, \qquad \text{where } V_{\text{in}}\text{ and } V_{\text{out}} \text{ are functions of time.}&lt;/math&gt;

* Note that this can also be viewed as a [[High-pass filter|high-pass]] [[electronic filter]]. It is a filter with a single [[complex zero|zero]] at DC (i.e., where &lt;math&gt;\omega = 0&lt;/math&gt;) and gain. The high pass characteristics of a differentiating amplifier can lead to unstable behavior when the circuit is used in an analog servo loop.  For this reason the system function would be re-formulated to use integrators.
|-
| Instrumentation amplifier ||  [[Image:Op-Amp Instrumentation Amplifier.svg|300px]] || Combines very high [[input impedance]], high [[common-mode rejection]], low [[DC offset]], and other properties used in making very accurate, low-noise measurements

* Is made by adding a [[#Non-inverting amplifier|non-inverting]] [[buffer amplifier|buffer]] to each input of the [[#Differential amplifier|differential amplifier]] to increase the input impedance.
|-
| Schmitt trigger || A [[bistable multivibrator]] implemented as a [[comparator]] with [[hysteresis]].[[Image:Op-Amp Schmitt Trigger.svg|300px]] || In this configuration, the input voltage is applied through the resistor &lt;math&gt;{R_1}&lt;/math&gt; (which may be the source internal resistance) to the non-inverting input and the inverting input is grounded or referenced. The hysteresis curve is non-inverting and the switching thresholds are &lt;math&gt;\pm \frac{R_1}{R_2}V_{\text{sat}}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{sat}}&lt;/math&gt; is the greatest output magnitude of the operational amplifier.

[[File:Op-Amp Inverting Schmitt Trigger.svg|300px]]

Alternatively, the input source and the [[electrical ground|ground]] may be swapped. Now the input voltage is applied directly to the inverting input and the non-inverting input is grounded or referenced. The hysteresis curve is inverting and the switching thresholds are &lt;math&gt;\pm \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2} V_{\text{sat}}&lt;/math&gt;. Such a configuration is used in the [[#Relaxation_oscillator|relaxation oscillator]] shown below.
|-
|Relaxation oscillator || [[File:Op-Amp Relaxation Oscillator.svg|300px]] || By using an [[RC network]] to add slow [[negative feedback]] to the inverting [[#Schmitt_trigger|Schmitt trigger]], a [[relaxation oscillator]] is formed. The feedback through the RC network causes the Schmitt trigger output to [[oscillate]] in an endless symmetric [[square wave]] (i.e., the Schmitt trigger in this configuration is an [[astable multivibrator]]).
|-
|Inductance gyrator || [[Image:Op-Amp Gyrator.svg|300px]] || Simulates an [[inductor]] (i.e., provides [[inductance]] without the use of a possibly costly inductor). The circuit exploits the fact that the current flowing through a capacitor behaves through time as the voltage across an inductor. The capacitor used in this circuit is smaller than the inductor it simulates and its capacitance is less subject to changes in value due to environmental changes.

This circuit is unsuitable for applications relying on the [[back EMF]] property of an inductor as this will be limited in a gyrator circuit to the voltage supplies of the op-amp.
|-
|Zero level detector | Voltage divider reference

* Zener sets reference voltage.
* Acts as a comparator with one input tied to ground.
* When input is at zero, op-amp output is zero (assuming split supplies.)
|-
|Negative impedance converter (NIC) || [[Image:Op-Amp Negative Impedance Converter.svg|300px]] ||

Creates a [[resistor]] having a negative value for any signal generator

* In this case, the ratio between the input voltage and the input current (thus the input resistance) is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\text{in}} = -R_3 \frac{R_1}{R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

In general, the components &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R_3&lt;/math&gt; need not be resistors; they can be any component that can be described with an [[Electrical impedance|impedance]].
|-
|Wien bridge oscillator || [[File:Wien bridge classic osc.svg|300px]] || Produces a very low distortion [[sine wave]]. Uses negative temperature compensation in the form of a light bulb or diode.
|-
|Precision rectifier || [[Image:Op-Amp Precision Rectifier.svg|250px|]] || The voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; across the forward biased diode in the circuit of a passive rectifier is undesired. In this active version, the problem is solved by connecting the diode in the negative feedback loop. The op-amp compares the output voltage across the load with the input voltage and increases its own output voltage with the value of V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. As a result, the voltage drop V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; is compensated and the circuit behaves very nearly as an ideal (''super'') [[diode]] with V&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 V. 

The circuit has speed limitations at high frequency because of the slow negative feedback and due to the low slew rate of many non-ideal op-amps.
|-
|Logarithmic output || [[Image:Op-Amp Logarithmic Amplifier.svg|300px]] || * The relationship between the input voltage &lt;math&gt;v_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; and the output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_{\text{out}}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{out}} = -V_{\text{T}} \ln \left( \frac{v_{\text{in}}}{I_{\text{S}} \, R} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

:where &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{S}}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''saturation current'' and &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{T}}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''thermal voltage''.

* If the operational amplifier is considered ideal, the negative pin is virtually grounded, so the current flowing into the resistor from the source (and thus through the diode to the output, since the op-amp inputs draw no current) is:

::&lt;math&gt;\frac{v_{\text{in}}}{R} = I_{\text{R}} = I_{\text{D}}&lt;/math&gt;

:where  &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{D}}&lt;/math&gt; is the current through the diode. As known, [[Diode#Shockley diode equation|the relationship between the current and the voltage]] for a [[diode]] is:

::&lt;math&gt;I_{\text{D}} = I_{\text{S}} \left( e^{\frac{V_{\text{D}}}{V_{\text{T}}}} - 1 \right).&lt;/math&gt;

:This, when the voltage is greater than zero, can be approximated by:

::&lt;math&gt;I_{\text{D}} \simeq I_{\text{S}} e^{\frac{V_{\text{D}}}{V_{\text{T}}}}. &lt;/math&gt;

:Putting these two formulae together and considering that the output voltage is the negative of the voltage across the diode (&lt;math&gt;V_{\text{out}} = -V_{\text{D}}&lt;/math&gt;), the relationship is proven. 

Note that this implementation does not consider temperature stability and other non-ideal effects.
|-
|Exponential output || [[Image:Op-Amp Exponential Amplifier.svg|300px]] || * The relationship between the input voltage &lt;math&gt;v_{\text{in}}&lt;/math&gt; and the output voltage &lt;math&gt;v_{\text{out}}&lt;/math&gt; is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{out}} = -R I_{\text{S}} e^{\frac{v_{\text{in}}}{V_{\text{T}}}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{S}}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''saturation current'' and &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{T}}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''thermal voltage''.

* Considering the operational amplifier ideal, then the negative pin is virtually grounded, so the current through the diode is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;I_{\text{D}} = I_{\text{S}} \left( e^{\frac{V_{\text{D}}}{V_{\text{T}}}} - 1 \right)&lt;/math&gt;

when the voltage is greater than zero, it can be approximated by:

:&lt;math&gt;I_{\text{D}} \simeq I_{\text{S}} e^{\frac{V_{\text{D}}}{V_{\text{T}}}}. &lt;/math&gt;

The output voltage is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;v_{\text{out}} = -R I_{\text{D}}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

      <comment>/* Folk Psychology */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Folk Psychology==

Everyone has ideas about how the mind works, and we use these ideas to explain and predict the behavior of ourselves and other people and animals. For example, if we see a child eating ice cream very quickly, we might explain this behavior in terms of a desire, such as &quot;she wanted to eat ice cream,&quot; a preference &quot;she likes ice cream,&quot; or perhaps a belief &quot;she believes that eating ice cream will make her happy.&quot; 

These commonsense notions of how people think is called &quot;folk psychology.&quot; Similarly, there is &quot;folk physics&quot; and &quot;folk biology.&quot; These ideas help use navigate the complex physical and social world we live in. 

But we can do better than that. All folk theories have problems with them. This is a very important thing for a beginning cognitive scientist to realize. We might feel very strongly about our folk psychology, but it comes from our culture and what we've learned through experience. There also might be an evolved component. But none of these are based on science or any other scholarly pursuit of knowledge. The beginnings of physics and biology also share with cognitive science this philosophical origin.

==Cognitive Science's Pre-History==

We know that scholars have been thinking about how the mind works since at least the times of the ancient Greek philosophers. Using introspection, conceptual analysis, and argumentation, philosophers sought to make sense of how people do and should think.

The study of the mind as an empirical science began in 1879 when Wilhelm Wundt founded his laboratory for psychology. Shortly afterward Sigmund Freud introduced his theories of psychoanalysis, which were widely influential. However, Freud's methods were based on case studies. Case studies can be informative, but have their limitations. Most scientists (of any field) believe that while case studies are an interesting starting point, and perhaps good for theory and hypothesis generation, they lack controls, objective measurement, quantification, and other &quot;rigorous&quot; aspects of experiments. Claims of causation that are taken purely from case studies are taken with great skepticism. 

In the 1900s there was a strong reaction, particularly in the United States, against case studies and other methods, such as introspection, which were regarded as non-rigorous. This led to a revolution in psychology. 

===Behaviorism===

Behaviorism rejected mental entities and events as legitimate subjects of scientific exploration. Instead, behaviorists insisted on using only objectively measurable in their studies. For example, beliefs are theoretical mental entities. But there is no objective way to determine what the contents of a belief are, or, indeed, any way to objectively determine if a particular belief even exists. 

When we attribute a belief to someone, we are always inferring it from their behavior. For example, if Jill says &quot;I live downtown,&quot; one might infer that Jill has a belief that she lives downtown. Behaviorists insisted that this inference not be made. Rather, they preferred to study only the fact that Jill said &quot;I live downtown,&quot; because that utterance is objectively measurable. For example, her voice might be recorded. This approach is called &quot;methodological behaviorism.&quot; 

The behaviorists often studied the relation of the stimulus presented to an organism, and the response that organism to it, without speculation as to what was going on in the mind of the organism. 

The behaviorists discovered a great deal of things, particularly about learning. You might have heard of the term &quot;positive reinforcement.&quot; This is a term coined by the behaviorists.

Some behaviorists went further. Rather than just claiming that mental entities were illegitimate subjects of scientific study, some claimed that mental entities did not exist at all. This is known as &quot;radical behaviorism.&quot;

As one might imagine, this restriction on how one can do science put severe constraints on what was possible. They often studies simpler, non-cultural creatures such as pigeons and rats. They even earned the nickname &quot;rat runners.&quot;

In 1960 Miller, Galanter, and Pribram wrote a book called Plans and the Structure of Behavior, which started to chip away at the behaviorist paradigm. They argued that the organism could not be viewed as a black box, but that animals used some kind of iterative problem-solving strategy (T.O.T.E.).

One of the most famous behaviorists, B. F. Skinner, wrote a book that attempted to explain language. Noam Chomsky wrote a review of this book which was enormously influential. In it, Chomsky claimed that language generation could not be understood without using theoretical mental entities. This review, as well as Plans and the Structure of Behavior, were two prominent works that helped usher in the cognitive revolution.

Psychology was changing itself from within, and Linguistics was suddenly becoming relevant to cognitive issues. Simultaneous developments in computers were the third major cause of the cognitive revolution.

===Computers and Computer Programs===

Scholars have often thought of the mind metaphorically-- as a lens, or as valves. When programmable computers were invented, it facilitated a whole new way of thinking about how a mind might work. This metaphor has been prominent ever since. 

A computer program manipulates information, and it can be programmed with little or no knowledge of how the computer actually works. This separation of hardware and software (the computer and the program) was essential for the the widespread appreciation of the &quot;cognitive level&quot; of understanding. In the cognitive metaphor, the brain is like the computer, and the mind, and things that it does, are like software. Although the nature of the hardware sometimes influences the behavior of the software (be it in computers or in people), this distinction freed scholars to theorize about the mind without needing to refer to brain structure. 

Shortly after computers were invented, people started programming computers to do smart things. The science of building intelligent things is known as &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; (AI) Part of what made behaviorism so attractive was that it was hard to imagine how a mind might work. But with intelligent computer programs, people could see how information might be communicated and manipulated. It was not hard to imagine that people's minds worked on similar principles.

The symbolism of the &quot;suit without a head&quot; represents leaderless organization and anonymity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lehrer&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vimeo.com/19806469 |title=Gabriella Coleman on Anonymous |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=February 9, 2011 |work=Brian Lehrer Live |publisher=Vimeo |accessdate=March 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Hacktivism''' is a [[w:portmanteau|portmanteau]] of ''[[w:Hacker (term)|hack]]'' and ''[[w:activism|activism]]''. It typically consists of manipulating a computer system for a politically or socially motivated purpose and often involves the nonviolent use of illegal or legally ambiguous digital tools and techniques. An individual who performs an act of hacktivism is said to be a hacktivist, and often seeks to accomplish what traditional activists achieve through physical protests. Hacktivists conduct their &quot;protests&quot; by bypassing censorship restrictions, shutting down online services, obtaining and distributing sensitive information, defacing websites, and generally circumventing online authorities and accepted practices. Whereas traditional activism was more location specific, hacktivism allows people to voice their social and political concerns to a larger audience. Far fewer people can do so much more to get a point across. Consider the number of people that would be affected if a popular website like YouTube were disabled for an hour compared to the audience a group of activists reach standing outside the capitol building for an entire day.

Among the more famous hacktivists are members of a group known simply as [[w:Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]. Anonymous is a loose association of users, with somewhat of a hierarchy, that don’t know each other’s real identities and act together in civil disobedience in the internet realm. They communicate in public online areas and use their collective knowledge and decisions to carry out acts they feel will further their collective agenda. A large number of high-profile hacktivism incidents have been carried out by members of Anonymous.

This article examines several of these incidents and considers the associated practical and ethical implications. Just as traditional protests range from peaceful to violent, acts of hacktivism range from legal free speech to distasteful vandalism and destruction. The cases that follow give a glimpse into the type of acts that fall under the umbrella of hacktivism.

==Controversy==

{{cquote|Both hacking and activism, and thus hacktivism, are loaded words ripe for a variety of interpretation. Therefore it is preferable not to clinically define hacktivism but rather to describe the spirit of hacktivism.|author=metac0m&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.thehacktivist.com/ | title = What is hacktivism? | accessdate = April 29, 2011 | last = metac0m}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Even among hacktivists that associate themselves with a particular group (e.g., Anonymous) there tends to be wide variance in the types of hacktivism performed. Some incidents reflect behavior that are generally condoned as acceptable civil disobedience while others reflect behavior most would consider immoral&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8567934.stm | title = Activists turn 'hacktivists' on the web | accessdate = April 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. As a result, hacktivisim is a contentious subject with adamant supporters and strong critics. Some people view hacktivism as a new means of activism, others view it as cyberterrorism. [[w:cyberterrorism|Cyberterrorism]] is an activity that purely seeks destruction and disruption, while hacktivism seeks to convey a message to the public and/or support a particular side of a debate. Both use similar techniques and both typically run afoul of the law, but the ethical questions tend to be much more unclear. The following three cases demonstrate the ambiguity.

===SOHH: Hacktivism as Vandalism &amp; Cyberterrorism===
{{rquote|right|
Anonymous has no regard for one’s material gains or how nannified a racial demographic is. Anonymous only exists to destroy. That lesson has been made abundantly clear to SOHH.com|
[[w:anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]|}}
In many cases, people express concerns about the unregulated power hacktivists exhibit. A disconcerting display of this power was made apparent during an attack of the popular hip hop forum and news site Support Online Hip Hop. In June 2008, SOHH.com was attacked by Anonymous. Members of the popular SOHH.com forum “Just Bugging Out” made comments which offended certain ebaumsworld.com users. In retaliation, members of Anonymous flooded the forums of SOHH, essentially shutting them down because of massive traffic. A few days later, on June 23, 2008, Anonymous arranged a series of [[w:Denial-of-service_attack|DDOS attacks]] against the website, annihilating 60% of the website's service capacity. On June 27, 2008, a final cross-site scripting attack was launched which resulted in the compromise of employee information and the defacement of SOHH.com’s main page. The website was littered with “images of Hitler, Nazi swastikas, images of slaves with nooses around their necks” and multiple ethnic slurs targeted at minority communities whose members regularly frequent the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=92033455 |title= Hip Hop Sites Attacked by Hate Groups |accessdate=April 29, 2011  |first=Felicia |last=Palmer |date=June 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website was heavily damaged in an attack clearly designed to humiliate and retaliate. Whether the attack was a simple prank or a definitive case of racism is unclear. However, this case does prove the point that since it is nearly impossible to track down and prosecute hacktivists, they are free from legal and moral restraints that many people live by.

===Operation Egypt: Hacktivism as a Means of Bypassing Censorship===
{{rquote|right|

{{rquote|right|
&quot;Anonymous wants you to offer free access to uncensored media in your entire country. When you ignore this message, not only will we attack your government websites, Anonymous will also make sure that the international media sees the horrid reality you impose upon your people.&quot;|
[[w:Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]|}}
Hacktivism should not always be shed in an immoral light just because of it’s clandestine nature and questionable legality. The [[w:2011 Egyptian Revolution|2011 Egyptian Revolution]] is an excellent case of hacktivism for the “right” reasons. On January 25, 2011, protests broke out in Egypt, with demonstrators crying out for free elections, freedom of speech, economic stability, the end of police brutality, and the end of corruption within the government. In support of the Egyptian people’s right to free speech and in opposition to the government’s restriction of sites such as Twitter, Anonymous began Operation Egypt, a massive DDOS attack on major websites of the Egyptian government. This attack took most major government websites offline until President Mubarak stepped down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41280813/ns/technology_and_science-security/ |title= Anonymous ‘hacktivists’ attack Egyptian websites |accessdate=April 29, 2011  |first=Paul |last=Wagenseil |date=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of January 2011, the Egyptian government ordered the nation’s [[w:Internet Service Providers|Internet Service Providers]] to shut down operation, effectively blacking out the country’s access to the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/31/reports-egypt-shutting-down-noor-its-last-isp/ |title= Egypt Shuts Down Noor, Its Last ISP |accessdate=April 29, 2011  |first=Alexia |last=Tsotsis |date=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that these measures were taken to limit the communication between members of the opposition as well as to censor news from outside world. Google and Twitter responded to this outrageous disruption of information and communication by launching a service called speak2tweet. The service allows users to leave voicemails which are then tweeted, essentially bypassing the restrictions of the Egyptian government by allowing large-scale communication without Internet access. Google representatives laid out a carefully designed message to explain their actions without stepping on too many toes: “We hope that this will go some way to helping people in Egypt stay connected at this very difficult time.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/01/31/twitter-by-phone-egypt/?utm_campaign=Tech+News&amp;utm_medium=Twitter&amp;utm_source=SNS.analytics |title= Google Teams Up With Twitter And SayNow To Bring Tweeting-By-Phone To Egypt |accessdate=April 29, 2011  |first=MG |last=Siegler |date=January 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here we see an example of two major, well-respected companies participating in a form of hacktivism.

===WikiLeaks: The Grey Area===
{{rquote|left|I do think that at the moment, WikiLeaks is the absolute most important project on the globe.|[[w:jacob appelbaum|Jacob Appelbaum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://infoactivismcamp.tacticaltech.org/node/36 | title = Interview with Jacob Appelbaum | accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[w:wikileaks|WikiLeaks]] is a non-profit organization that runs a website where anyone on the internet can anonymously publish documents and information. It is often used to distribute secret, classified governmental reports that were never designed for public access. WikiLeaks states that its &quot;primary interest is in exposing oppressive regimes in Asia, the former Soviet bloc, Sub-Saharan Africa and the Middle East, but we also expect to be of assistance to people of all regions who wish to reveal unethical behaviour in their governments and corporations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutwikileaks&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/WikiLeaks:About |title=Wikileaks:About |publisher=WikiLeaks |date= |accessdate=3 June 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080314204422/http://www.wikileaks.org/wiki/Wikileaks:About |archivedate=14 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikileaks represents a type of “information hacktivism”, where instead of attacking other websites, it attacks information secrecy with the goal of forcing openness, governmental transparency, privacy, and political change. In December 2010, WikiLeaks began publishing large numbers of secret United State diplomatic cables and was came under intense pressure by US government to stop. Hacktivists operating with the group Anonymous declared support for WikiLeaks' right to free speech and began &quot;Operation Avenge Assange&quot; -- a pro-WikiLeaks hacktivism campaign to take down the opposition.

{{cquote|Julian Assange deifies everything we hold dear. The future of the internet hangs in the balance. We are Anonymous. We do not forgive; we do not forget. Expect us.|author=Anonymous&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.buzzfeed.com/scott/everybody-loves-julian | title=Everybody Loves Julian | accessdate=April 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Anonymous organized a series of DDOS attacks against major companies, including Amazon, PayPal, Mastercard, in retaliation for their anti-WikiLeak behavior. A threat researcher at PandaLabs credited Anonymous for launching an attack which brought down the Swedish prosecutor's website when WikiLeaks founder [[w:Julian Assange|Julian Assange]] was arrested in London and refused bail in preparation for his extradition to Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/technology/technology-news/assange-wanted-by-us-for-espionage-offences-20101208-18ouj.html/ |title= Assange wanted by US for 'espionage offences' |accessdate=April 28, 2011 | location=Melbourne |work=The Age |first=Asher |last=Moses |date=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks received widespread media coverage and disabled many of the target's web presences for days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/wikileaks-founder-julian-assange-arrested-in-london-15023657.html/ |title= Wikileaks founder Julian Assange arrested in London |accessdate=April 28, 2011 | location=Melbourne |work=The Age |first=Asher |last=Moses |date=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wikileaks has made it clear that Anonymous glorifies the concept of freedom. Whether it is freedom of speech, freedom of information, or freedom of action, hacktivists such as Anonymous will stop at nothing to maintain these &quot;rights.&quot;

==Conclusion==
As the cases above demonstrate, hacktivism can refer to a very diverse set of acts of civil disobedience that are politically or socially motivated. Most hacktivism is illegal, but may or may not be immoral. The blessing and the curse of hacktivism is that it is easy to remain anonymous and untraceable -- it is often impossible to hold a particular individual accountable for their actions. As such, &quot;peer pressure&quot; and &quot;societal acceptance&quot; cease to be effective deterrents for irrational and unethical behavior. Some acts by self-proclaimed hacktivists fall squarely on one side of the line between hacktivism and cyberterrorism; many others depend on exactly where the line is drawn. The corresponding ethical issues are equally uncertain. One thing is for sure: hacktivists don't show any signs of quitting anytime soon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction=
We jump over the classic introductory blah-blah-blah about how it looks like nature around us and how our brain perceives it. We simply say: we have to model a '''world''' of '''three dimensions''' on a '''flat screen''' (only '''two dimensions'''). The same problem that painters, sculptors and architects have already solved it thousands of years ago. How do we do this? Simple, we use the fundamental element of descriptive geometry: '''the projection'''.&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:OurWorldATriangle.png|Our world, the triangle|left|alt=A]] 
But to understand this concept, we need to see how we can represent a world of two dimensions on a two-dimensional screen. How do we represent a two-dimensional world (a world of zero thickness, only length and width, or height and width) in a plane, or in other words in a Cartesian coordinate system with two axes: '''xOy'''. Nothing simpler. As you can easily guess, for each point '''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' of our two-dimensional world we may assign a point '''P'''('''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'''), in our plane  '''xOy'''. '''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' values ​​are projections on the '''x''' axis and '''y''' axis of '''P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' position. Or values ​​relative to the origin '''O'''('''0''','''0''') coordinate system. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on the position of the point from the origin, these values ​​can be negative or positive. Even more, we can decide where it is spatially located (2D space) the origin '''O'''('''0''','''0'''). So a point may have the different coordinates (xi, yi) value based on the spatial position of the origin '''O'''. &lt;br /&gt;
If in addition, we alter the measuring unit on the two axes, of course we get again different values ​​for xi and yi. 
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:AlteringOurWorld1.png‎|Altering our world|left|alt=A]]
Also, we can rotate our Cartesian coordinate system. The new values for '''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' and '''y&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''' are different, too.
&lt;br /&gt;
The main conclusion of this brief presentation is that the first thing we need to do when we want to represent the world around us, is to inform our graphic display system about the coordinate system used, the position of the origin, axes position, the unit of measure used etc.
&lt;br /&gt;
Then we initialize the coordinates x, y of the points (vertices) that define our triangle with proper values and will specify the order in which they will be joined by lines. Last thing is to fill it with color.
&lt;br /&gt;
Why I chose a triangle as an example? The triangle is the simplest geometric figure. Any polygon, no matter how complex it is, in plane or space can be decomposed into triangles. Also, any closed curve can be approximated by triangles. For example a circle can be approximated by a regular polygon inscribed in it. The more points are the more accurate approximation.
[[File:AproximatingTheFigures.png|Approximating the figures|left|alt=A]]
In addition, or perhaps precisely because of this, the current graphics adapters can easily generate and process tons of triangles. Even if there are available others polygons to represent images and objects, in fact, the 2D/3D world is the world of triangles.
&lt;br /&gt;
Quoting Einstein &quot;everything is relative&quot;, if we look at the three transformations of the coordinate system, and analyze them from the system point of view, we get the three basic transformations used in the 3D world: translation, scaling, rotation.
* '''Translation:''' if we add/subtract same value to '''x''' coordinates for the vertices of the triangle or/and to '''y''' coordinates will obtain a translation of the triangle position relative to the origin '''O'''('''0''','''0''')'''.
* '''Scaling:''' if we multiply/divide with same value the '''x''' coordinates for the vertices of the triangle or/and the '''y''' coordinates will obtain a scaled version of the our original triangle, smaller or bigger.
* '''Rotation:''' if we alter in a trigonometric manner (using the unit circle) the coordinates for the vertices of the triangle will obtain a rotated version of our original triangle.
Now think what would happen if we combine the all three basic transformations, more or less. Anything can happen or whatever we want if we know how to do it.
&lt;br /&gt;
Enough with the 2D geometry is time to move on to what hurts us, '''3D representation''' of the world around us. We will introduce a new element called '''perspective''', or the angles between the lines that lend the illusion of depth. And we decreed: 
:: '''3D = 2D + perspective'''
[[File:OrthographicProjection.png‎|Orthographic projection|left|alt=A]]
From geometric point of view the '''perspective''' corresponds to the '''z''' axis. In practice two types of projections are used: the orthogonal/'''orthographic''' projection and the '''perspective''' projection. The orthographic projection is mainly used in CAD ​​applications and more rarely in some games or multimedia applications. 
&lt;br /&gt;
I think everybody in here, had a problem to &quot;see&quot; the projections in space geometry problems. At least in college.
&lt;br /&gt;
Be careful, there is a new coordinate: '''z'''. Every point/vertex have now three coordinates. In case of orthographic projection, the '''z''' axis '''parallel lines''' remain '''parallel''' to the horizon. The line of view is parallel to the axis '''z'''. 
&lt;br /&gt;
The only notable aspect is how we perceive the distance to the origin, '''O'''('''0''','''0''','''0''') and the angle of view (z-axis angles with x and y axes).
&lt;br /&gt;
The perspective projection is mainly used in games and multimedia applications. Z axis parallel lines &quot;meet&quot; each other at the far horizon. How &quot;far&quot; is the horizon? It depends on us, how far we set the eye of the observer position (position of current camera view at a time) from the near horizon. The near horizon usually defines our display screen.
[[File:PerspectiveProjection.png‎|Perspective projection|left|alt=A]]
Now the only question which we must be clear on is the following: whether the projection chosen, although the resulting image of reality which we perceive it is only 2D not 3D. Who computes the actual coordinates of the points in the real 2D plan to create the illusion of 3D space? Us? This is madness. No. All the modern graphics cards (the GPUs) will do this for us. Only in the worst case, the CPU.
&lt;br /&gt;
However, in case of animations, our intervention is required to tell our application what it is has to done.
&lt;br /&gt;
To increase the feeling of depth, there are additional techniques besides classical adjustment of geometric dimensions, such as: adding shades, shadows and fog.
* '''Shades''': is similar to the geometric adjustments, but to the brightness of color of the different parts of a object. Image you have a cube with same color sides. Even if we have same color at all, because of different position of the sides from the source of light, there are different intensities of the same color, different shades of same color.
* '''Shadows''': adding shadows depending on how many light sources are present and their intensity, is one of the most common techniques used to increase the feeling of depth. 
* '''Fog''': the effect of &quot;fog&quot; is often used for long distance views to emphasize the effect of reducing of the clarity caused by the presence of the surrounding atmosphere.
All three techniques refer in fact the second 3D graphics major challenge: '''lighting technique'''. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Those presented above are enough to introduce and familiarize our readers with the basics. Now we move to a brief overview of OpenGL. [[#top|TOP]]

=What is OpenGL=
[[File:OpenGL-Location.png|OpenGL location|left|alt=A]]
OpenGL is defined as '''a software interface to graphics hardware'''. It is a 3D graphics and modeling library that is highly portable and very fast. Using OpenGL, you can create 3D graphic application with exceptional visual quality and performance. It is an industry standard, stable, reliable and portable, evolving, scalable, easy to use and well documented.
&lt;br /&gt;
OpenGL is window and operating system independent. To integrate it into various window systems, additional libraries are used to modify a native window into an OpenGL capable window. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Every window system has its own unique library and functions to do this:
*: '''GLX''' for the '''X Windows''' system, common on '''*nix''' platforms
*: '''AGL''' for the '''Apple Macintosh''' ('''Carbon''')
*: '''WGL''' for '''Microsoft Windows''' ('''GDI''')
*: '''OpenGL ES''' it is an extension to support embedded system such as Android, iOS etc.
In short terms, OpenGL is an '''independent standard''' operating system and window system. 
&lt;br /&gt;
OpenGL '''is not''' a &quot;language&quot;, but is callable from Ada, C, C++, Fortran, Python, Perl and Java and offers complete independence from network protocols and topologies.
==A brief history==
The ancestor of OpenGL was IRIS GL from Silicon Graphics, a 2D graphics library. It evolved into the 3D programming API for that company’s high-end IRIS graphics workstations. IRIS GL had not been designed from the onset to have a vertex-style geometry processing interface, and it became apparent that to move forward SGI needed to make a clean break. OpenGL is the result of SGI’s efforts to evolve and improve IRIS GL’s portability. The new graphics API would offer the power of GL but would be an “open” standard, with input from other graphics hardware vendors, and would allow for easier adaptability to other hardware platforms and operating systems. OpenGL would be designed from the ground up for 3D geometry processing. [[#top|TOP]]
[[File:OpenGL-API_Hierarchy.png‎|OpenGL API Hierarchy|left|alt=A]]

==OpenGL ARB==
An open standard is not really open if only one vendor controls it. SGI’s business at the time was high-end computer graphics. Once you’re at the top, you find that the opportunities for growth are somewhat limited. SGI realized that it would also be good for the company to do something good for the industry to help grow the market for high-end computer graphics hardware. A truly open standard embraced by a number of vendors would make it easier for programmers to create applications and content that is available for a wider variety of platforms. Software is what really sells computers, and if SGI wanted to sell more computers, it needed more software that would run on its computers. Other vendors realized this, too, and the '''OpenGL Architecture Review Board''' (ARB) was born. Although SGI originally controlled licensing of the OpenGL API, the founding members of the OpenGL ARB were SGI, Digital Equipment Corporation, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft. On July 1, 1992, version 1.0 of the OpenGL specification was introduced. Over time, the ARB grew to consist of many more members, many from the PC hardware community, and it met four times a year to maintain and enhance the specification and to make plans to promote the OpenGL standard. Over time, SGI’s business fortunes declined for reasons well beyond the scope of this article. In 2006, an essentially bankrupt SGI transferred control of the OpenGL standard from the ARB to a new working group at the Khronos Group ([http://www.khronos.org www.khronos.org]). The Khronos Group is a member-funded industry consortium focused on the creation and maintenance of open media standards. Most ARB members were already members of Khronos, and the transition was essentially painless. Today, the Khronos Group continues to evolve and promote OpenGL and its sibling API. [[#top|TOP]]

==API Wars and the guerilla==
Competition, economic interests, the desire to dominate the market have led to the start of the so-called '''API Wars'''. Most companies recognize that competition is good for everyone in the long run and will endorse, support, and even contribute to industry standards. An interesting diversion from this ideal occurred during OpenGL’s youth on the Windows platform. When low-cost 3D graphics accelerators began to become available for the PC, many hardware vendors and game developers were attracted to OpenGL for its ease of use compared to Microsoft’s Direct 3D. Microsoft provided a driver kit that made it very easy to make an OpenGL driver for Windows 98. This kit saved literally years of effort in creating a robust OpenGL driver for Windows NT and Windows 98. Microsoft discouraged vendors from using a more rigorous driver model, and every PC graphics card vendor had created OpenGL drivers ready to ship with Windows 98. This attention to OpenGL by game developers created quite a political stir at the 1997 SigGraph and Game Developers conferences. Just before Windows 98 was released, Microsoft announced that it would not extend the OpenGL driver code license beyond the Windows 98 beta period, and that hardware vendors were forbidden to release their drivers. Virtually every PC hardware vendor had a robust and fast OpenGL driver ready to roll for consumer PCs, but couldn’t ship them. To further complicate things, shortly thereafter a struggling SGI announced a new Windows NT–based workstation. SGI simultaneously pledged to discontinue promoting OpenGL for consumer applications, and to work with Microsoft on a new API called Fahrenheit. '''''OpenGL was as good as dead'''''. 
&lt;br /&gt;
A funny thing happened on the way to oblivion, and even without SGI, '''''OpenGL began to take on a life of its own'''''. Hardware vendors with some help from SGI (pre-Fahrenheit) continued to support OpenGL with new drivers. Games aren’t the only application that OpenGL was well suited for, and most developers wanted their Windows NT software to be able to run on the consumer version of Windows, too. When OpenGL was again widely available on consumer hardware, developers didn’t really need SGI or anyone else touting the virtues of OpenGL. OpenGL was easy to use and had been around for years. This meant there was an abundance of documentation, sample programs, SigGraph papers, and so on. OpenGL began to flourish. As more developers began to use OpenGL, it became clear who was really in charge of the industry: the developers. The more applications that shipped with OpenGL support, the more pressure mounted on hardware vendors to produce better OpenGL hardware and high-quality drivers. Consumers don’t really care about API technology. They just want software that works, and they will buy whatever graphics card runs their favorite game or application the best. Developers care about time to market, portability, and code reuse. Go back in time and try to recompile that old Direct3D programs, if you dare. Using OpenGL enabled many developers to meet customer demand better, and in the end it’s the customers who pay the bills. As time passed, Fahrenheit fell solely into Microsoft’s hands and was eventually discontinued altogether.
&lt;br /&gt;
Direct3D has evolved further to include more and more OpenGL features, functionality, and ease of use. Today’s Direct3D bears little resemblance to the tortured API it once was. OpenGL’s popularity, however, has continued to grow as an alternative to Windows-specific rendering technology and is now widely supported across all major operating systems and hardware devices. Even embedded devices with 3D graphics technology like cellphones, pods, pads and tablets support a subset of OpenGL, called OpenGL ES. Today, all new 3D accelerated graphics cards for the PC ship with both OpenGL and Direct3D drivers. This is largely due to the fact that many developers continue to prefer OpenGL for new development. OpenGL today is widely recognized and accepted as the industry-standard API for real-time 2D and 3D graphics. 
&lt;br /&gt;
This momentum will carry OpenGL into the foreseeable future as the API of choice for a wide range of applications and hardware platforms. All this also makes OpenGL well positioned to take advantage of future 3D graphics innovations. Because of OpenGL’s extension mechanism, vendors can expose new hardware features without waiting on Microsoft or some industry committee, and cutting-edge developers can exploit them as soon as updated drivers are available. With the addition of the '''OpenGL shading language''', OpenGL has shown its continuing adaptability to meet the challenge of an evolving 3D graphics programming pipeline. Finally, OpenGL is a specification that has shown that it can be applied to a wide variety of programming paradigms. From C/C++ to Java and Visual Basic, even newer languages such as C# are now being used to create PC games and applications using OpenGL. '''''OpenGL is here to stay'''''.
&lt;br /&gt;
One of the results of the API wars is '''Mesa 3D'''. Mesa is not OpenGL, but it is an open-source implementation of the OpenGL specification. The Mesa project was originally started by Brian Paul. More details at [http://www.mesa3d.org www.mesa3d.org]. [[#top|TOP]]

=GLUT support vs SDL platform=
The OpenGL's predecessor, IRIS GL, had  support for building and manipulation of windows, as well as managing input devices (keyboard/mouse/joystick). But to create a set of APIs with no dependencies from the operating and windowing system, this support was removed from the further development of OpenGL. This has allowed the development of OpenGL for a wide range of devices, computers and operating systems. On the other hand, lack of this support has created and creates difficulties even for the most skilled programmers. Learning the X, Microsoft  or Carbon windowing system can be a pain in the ass, especially for beginners.
[[File:GLUT&amp;SDL_Framework_for_OpenGL.png‎|Framework for OpenGL|left|alt=A]]
To cover this lack, initially have been developed '''TK''' and '''AUX''' toolkits. In the end, after corrections and improvements, '''GLUT''' (GL Utility Toolkit) support has been released. GLUT documentation available at [http://www.opengl.org/documentation/specs/glut/spec3/spec3.html opengl.org/documentation/specs/glut/spec3/spec3.html].
&lt;br /&gt;
Another OpenGL major support is represented by '''SDL''', Simple DirectMedia Layer, a more versatile multimedia platform. '''Sam Lantinga''' created the library, first releasing it in early 1998. I will not insist here on the history of SDL, but I enumerate a few achievements under this platform: '''OpenTTD''', '''FreeCiv''', '''The Battle for Wesnoth''', '''Spring'''. SDL documentation available at [http://www.libsdl.org www.libsdl.org]. &lt;br /&gt;
Which one is better? It depends. If you are a beginner or the application you do is simple then it is recommended to use GLUT. If you work at a complex application, such as a game with advanced graphics and sound, then you need to use the SDL platform. &lt;br /&gt;
As you can see in the picture, regardless of the framework, an OpenGL application consists of three components:
*: '''''Initialization''''' - creating objects, memory allocation, registering handlers, etc.
*: '''''Main program loop''''' - while NOT exit condition occured, get an event from queue (user input, system, program itself etc) , dispatch it to the associated routine/handler, '''render the scene''' (based on OpenGL API) and loop again.
*: '''''Exit program''''' - stop the execution, clearing the memory, closing the opened files etc.
One of the major differences between GLUT and SDL, beyond those related to the support, is the accessibility to the main program loop. GLUT does not give you a direct access to this. It uses a callback mechanism for a number of usual functions called inside of main loop.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Problem Statement ==
 Find a closed form for

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) + \sin(A+B) + \sin(A+2B) + ... + \sin(A+(n-1)B)&lt;/math&gt;.

Note: A 'closed form' is not mathematically defined, but just means a simplified formula which does not involve '...', or a summation sign. In our problem, we should look for a formula that only involves variables A, B, n, and known operations like the four operations, radicals, exponents, logarithm, and trigonometric functions.

== Method 1 ==


To sum the series

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) + \sin(A+B) + \sin(A+2B) + ... + \sin(A+(n-1)B) = S&lt;/math&gt;.

Multiply each term by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2\sin \left( \frac{B}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Then we have

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2\sin(A) \sin \left( \frac{B}{2} \right) = \cos \left(A - \frac{B}{2} \right) - \cos \left(A + \frac{B}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

and similarly for all terms to

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2\sin(A+(n-1)B) \sin \left( \frac{B}{2} \right) = \cos \left(A + \frac{(2n-3)B}{2} \right) - \cos \left(A + \frac{(2n-1)B}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

Summing, we find that nearly all the terms cancel out and we are left with

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 2S \sin \left( \frac{B}{2} \right) = \cos \left(A - \frac{B}{2} \right) - \cos \left(A + \frac{(2n-1)B}{2} \right) = 2\sin \left ( A + \frac{n-1}{2}B \right ) \sin \left ( \frac{nB}{2} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

Hence

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle S = \sin \left ( A + \frac{n-1}{2}B \right ) \frac{\sin \left ( \frac{nB}{2} \right )}{\sin \left( \frac{B}{2} \right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, if

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle C = \cos(A) + \cos(A+B) + \cos(A+2B) + ... + \cos(A+(n-1)B)&lt;/math&gt; then

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle C = \cos \left ( A + \frac{n-1}{2}B \right ) \frac{\sin \left ( \frac{nB}{2} \right )}{\sin \left( \frac{B}{2} \right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

==Method 2==
Consider the following sum

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle s = e^{iA} + e^{i(A+B)} + + ... + e^{i(A+(n-1)B)}&lt;/math&gt;.

Since s is a geometric series with common ratio &lt;math&gt;e^{iB}&lt;/math&gt;, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle s = \frac{e^{iA}(e^{inB}-1)}{e^{iB}-1} = \frac{e^{iA}(e^{inB}-1)}{e^{iB}-1} = \frac{e^{iA}e^{inB/2}(e^{inB/2}-e^{-inB/2})}{e^{iB/2}(e^{iB/2}-e^{-iB/2})}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; = e^{i(A+(n-1)B/2)} \frac{\sin \left(\frac{nB}{2}\right)}{\sin \left(\frac{B}{2}\right)} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, 

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \sin(A) + \sin(A+B) + \sin(A+2B) + ... + \sin(A+(n-1)B) = Im(s) = \sin \left( A+\frac{(n-1)B}{2} \right) \frac{\sin \left(\frac{nB}{2}\right)}{\sin \left(\frac{B}{2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \cos(A) + \cos(A+B) + \cos(A+2B) + ... + \cos(A+(n-1)B) = Re(s) = \cos \left( A+\frac{(n-1)B}{2} \right) \frac{\sin \left(\frac{nB}{2}\right)}{\sin \left(\frac{B}{2}\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ionisation Energy==
Ionisation Energy is the energy needed to dislodge an electron from the attraction which holds it in an atom/ion/molecule.  The first ionisation energy is the energy needed to dislodge the least powerfully held electron. Second ionization energy is the energy needed to dislodge the second least powerfully held electron etc.

The size of the ionisation energy for an electron is related to the size of the attraction between that electron and the nucleus to which it is bound. 4 factors effect the size of this attraction.

''' The number of protons in the nucleus. '''&lt;br /&gt;
The higher the number of protons in the nucleus the higher its total positive charge and the higher the electrostatic attraction between it and the negatively charged electron.

''' The distance between the electron and the nucleus it is bound to. '''&lt;br /&gt;
Attraction decreases with distance.

''' The number of intervening electrons between the electron and the nucleus - 'Screening' '''&lt;br /&gt;
Intervening electrons have a negative charge which repulses other electrons and reduces the attraction between electron and nucleus.  This is referred to as screening.  Note that intervening electrons do not 'block' attraction as the name suggests rather they reduce attraction by providing an opposing repulsion.

''' Whether or not the electron under consideration is alone in its orbital or paired with another electron '''&lt;br /&gt;
Paired electrons repulse each other and reduce attraction between the electron and the nucleus.

==Changes in first Ionisation Energy within groups and periods==

The First Ionisation Energy '''decreases''' down''' Group II'''. This is because each element has a new shell, increasing the amount of shielding and the atomic radius.

The First Ionisation Energy '''increases''' across '''Period III'''.  This is because:
a) The effective nuclear charge increases, due to increase in the number of protons.
b) The radius of atom decreases with increasing atomic number, hence more energy is required to remove outer electrons.
c) The number of shells remains the same; leading to the same amount of shielding.

There is a drop from Mg to Al because there is a new subshell which is higher in energy (more energy is required to remove the outer electrons).
There is another drop from P to S because both electrons are now filled in the 3p subshell, leading to some repulsion.

==Changes in Atomic Radius==

Across Period 3 (Na to Ar), the number of protons in the nucleus increases: the effective nuclear charge increases; shielding by inner electrons is unchanged; new electrons enter the same shell; hence atomic radius decreases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''cubic''' equation is an equation of the form

:ax&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + bx&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + cx + d = 0

to be solved for x.  There are three possible values for x, known as the roots of the equation, though two or all three of the values may be equal (repeated root).  If a, b, c and d are all real numbers, at least one value of x must be real.  There are two possible cases: the other two roots may be real, or they may be a pair of complex conjugate numbers.

The roots can always be expressed exactly as surds.  However, if all three roots are real, the surds involve the cube roots of complex numbers.  In that case, they are in general most easily calculated using trigonometric functions.

In the above equation, ''a'' is non-zero (or the equation would be quadratic).  Divide through by ''a'' to get the equation in the form

:x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + Ax&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + Bx + C = 0.

Let

&lt;math&gt;Q = \frac{3B-A^2}{9}, \,\, R = \frac{9AB - 27C -2A^3}{54}, \,\, D = Q^3+R^2.&lt;/math&gt;

D is called the '''discriminant'''.  If D &gt; 0, two roots are complex; if D = 0 there is a (real) repeated root; if D &lt; 0 there are three unequal real roots.

Assume D &lt; 0.  Clearly, Q&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = D-R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; must be less than D so is also negative; thus, -Q&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and -Q are both positive.  Let

&lt;math&gt;\cos (\theta) = \frac{R}{\sqrt{-Q^3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

Then the three roots are

:&lt;math&gt;x_1 = 2\sqrt{-Q} \cos \left( \frac{\theta}{3} \right) - \frac{A}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_2 = 2\sqrt{-Q} \cos \left( \frac{\theta}{3} + 120^O \right) - \frac{A}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;x_3 = 2\sqrt{-Q} \cos \left( \frac{\theta}{3} + 240^O \right) - \frac{A}{3}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this book we will use the dual-process theory of the mind and brain to help make sense of many functions of the human mind. 

Can you do everything by learning through trial and error? On the face of it, no. If you are in a new city, and need to get to a museum, you do not use learning from trial and error, at the level of which turns to make on which street, to know how to get there. For that, you need a fundamentally different kind of thinking. That is what the newer, deliberative part of the mind is good at. Some argue that this is what the prefrontal cortex is for.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J. (2013). Moral tribes: Emotion, reason, and the gap between us and them. The Penguin Press, HC., page 198.&lt;/ref&gt; 

We can think of the modular parts of the mind and brain as the automatic settings on a camera. They are good for most cases, but occasionally they need to be overridden for particular instances.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J. (2013). Moral tribes: Emotion, reason, and the gap between us and them. The Penguin Press, HC.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to conflict-monitoring theory, the ACC is responsible for figuring out when the mind is in disagreement. When a conflict is detected, the DLPFC is activated to resolve it, much like appealing to a higher court of law.&lt;ref&gt;Greene, J. (2013). Moral tribes: Emotion, reason, and the gap between us and them. The Penguin Press, HC., page 295.&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Awareness==

There is a lot going on in our minds that we're not aware of. For example&lt;ref name=&quot;Miller1962&quot;&gt;Miller, G. A. (1962). Pychology: The Science of Mental Life. New York: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;, if one is asked what one's mother's maiden name is, one is conscious of the name. But when asked how that memory was retrieved, one doesn't know. All that we know is that the information appeared in consciousness.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==
Entropy is a measure of how organised a system is. A system with low entropy is one with a organised, or unlikely configuration. For example: if you have a glass of water with average temperature 20 degrees, a low entropy state would be the top half 30 degrees and bottom half 10 degrees, whereas the highest entropy state is the entire glass 20 degrees.

== Mathematically ==
To quantify this, we find the total number of microstates(Ω); all the possible states the system could be in. For a coin: Ω = 2 (heads / tails), 2 coins: Ω = 4 (HH/HT/TH/TT), N coins: Ω = 2&lt;sup&gt;N&lt;/sup&gt;. If you have two systems with Ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; microstates, Ω&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; = Ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Ω&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

To apply this to a system of particles, use a volume V with N atoms. Classically, atoms can have an infinite number of states, making Ω infinite. But due to results from quantum physics, Ω is in fact finite. Given a total energy E and N atoms with mass m: 

&lt;math&gt; \Omega = \frac{c}{N!}\left(\frac{V(2mE)^{3/2}}{h^3}\right)^{N}&lt;/math&gt;

c is a constant that depends on geometry.

h is Planck's constant.

A few notes here:

# It is possible to derive this from a pseudo-quantum argument, which says that there are only finite positions in the box equal to the volume divided by h&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and number of possible momenta is the surface area of a hypersphere. But since these are both aphysical and irrelevant, I might as well just state the formula(learn quantum mechanics!). 
# I put a constant in the formula, because we are mainly interested in how the number of states grow rather than the exact number. 
# The N! is only for indistinguishable particles. This is another quantum effect that means nature can't tell two atoms of the same kind apart.
# The numbers that statistical mechanics works with are on the order of N = 10&lt;sup&gt;27&lt;/sup&gt;, so Ω is generally very, very big.

Entropy is defined as &lt;math&gt;S = k_b \ln(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, where k&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is Boltzmann's constant. So:

&lt;math&gt; S = k_b \ln\left(\frac{c}{N!}\left(\frac{V(2mE)^{3/2}}{h^3}\right)^{N}\right) = k_b (\ln c - \ln N! + N(\ln V + 3/2 \ln 2mE - 3 \ln h)) &lt;/math&gt;

Note: the units are fuddled in the last bit, it won't matter though. Stirling's approximation says for large N: &lt;math&gt; N! \sim N \ln(N) - N &lt;/math&gt;. So:

&lt;math&gt; S = N k_b(\ln(V)+\frac{3}{2}\ln(E) + D)  &lt;/math&gt;

Since the important part is the change, I put the constants into D(assuming particle conservation). Also, &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2} fNk_bT&lt;/math&gt;, so:

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S = N k_b(\ln\frac{V_2}{V_1}+3/2 \ln\frac{T_2}{T_1})&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S = N k_b\ln\frac{V_2}{V_1}&lt;/math&gt; at constant temperature.

&lt;math&gt;\Delta S = 3/2 N k_b \ln\frac{T_2}{T_1}&lt;/math&gt; at constant volume.

It is also useful to define temperature in terms of entropy:

&lt;math&gt;T = \frac{1}{{\partial S\over\partial E}} = \frac{2E}{3Nk_b}&lt;/math&gt;

==Introduction==
This article seeks to explore the existing U.S electric grid as a network.  The United States electric grid is a complex network comprised of distribution lines running on various voltages across three sectors of electric grid transmission. There are four categories of the U.S electric grid with each category representing different voltage categories namely; [[File:Electicaltransmissionlines3800ppx.JPG|thumb|right|High-power electrical transmission tower.]]
* 	345-499 kV
* 	500-699 kV
*       700-799 kV
*       1,000 kV (DC)
The U.S electric grid is nearly a century old and is the largest interconnected physical network. Its complex interactions with human beings has led it to be dubbed an ecosystem. According to the Department of Energy (DOE), the electric grid consists of more than 9,200 electric generating units with more than 1,000,000 megawatts of generating capacity. It is also connected to more than 300,000 miles of transmission lines&lt;ref&gt;Grid 2030, (2003): United States Department of Energy http://www.ferc.gov/eventcalendar/files/20050608125055-grid-2030.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Generation==
Electric generation is the first step in supplying energy to consumers. Electric generation varies with the source of energy. According to the U.S Energy Information Administration there are six major sources of energy for electric generation. The following is a list of energy sources as arranged in the order of power it generates into the national grid&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration  (USEIA) http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/table1_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;.
* Coal
* Natural gas
* Nuclear
* Hydro
* Other renewable sources
* Petroleum

==Transmission==
The electric grid shares spatial similarities to other networks such as the internet where individual links are observed to have a physical location. The transmission and distribution of electricity is of interest from geographical, social and economic points of view. The economic aspects of the electric grid have received a lot of attention recently due to shifting attention towards the electric grid's reliability and robustness. The U.S Electric grid is independently owned and operated by various players in the industry. Aging infrastructure coupled with increased domestic consumption has complicated electricity distribution and has caused limited outages. 
[[Image:Electricity grid simple- North America.svg|400px|thumb|Generation-Transmission-Distribution on the Electric Grid.]]
As a result of the increased demand, there is need for a more efficient distribution and consumption network, both of which are problems addressed by a [[w: smart grid|&quot;smart grid.&quot;]] Upon generation, step-up transformers are used to 'step-up' voltage for transmission across the grid. This helps reduce losses on the transmission lines, however consumers need the voltage to be stepped-down to lower a voltage such as 13kV and 4kV for large energy consumers (e.g. factories) whereas small consumers (e.g. residential properties) recieve 120V or 240V.
Due to aging infrastructure, the current state of the electric grid needs renovations to meet current demand&lt;ref&gt;Grid 2030, (2003): United States Department of Energy http://www.ferc.gov/eventcalendar/files/20050608125055-grid-2030.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Some renovations could save energy due to power losses that occur during the transmission and distribuition phases in the electric grid. Also, high demand during peak hours has led to a congested state of service delivery. This is analogous to transportation networks when traffic flow exceeding roadway capacity. In most congested transportation networks, &quot;Stop and Go&quot; conditions exist where free flow of traffic is limited. 
Without a reliable system, sustainable energy production practices and reasonably priced energy, there can be no sustainable long term growth&lt;ref&gt;European wind Energy http://www.ewea.org/index.php?id=885&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Electric grid failure==
====Brownout vs Blackout====
Interruption in service on the electric grid may occur for a myriad of reasons.  Whether it is a single catastrophic event that was not foreseen, or a planned event by utility companies such as for maintenance, or poor planning (e.g. simply designing for average demand), utilities will face problems throughout their planned lifetime. To operate optimally and minimize the number of blackouts, operators at times are required to reduce the amount of voltage provided to certain areas. By reducing the voltage between 10 to 25% provided to a consumer, most lighting and heating equipment can still function. However, the general life of electrical equipment is shortened as a result of operating at lower voltages than those they are designed for. This process of reducing voltage in certain service areas during peak hours is known as brownout&lt;ref&gt;Energy dictionary http://www.energyvortex.com/energydictionary/blackout__brownout__brown_power__rolling_blackout.html&lt;/ref&gt;. While not catastrophic to the electrical network, as explained earlier, brownouts do have a cost associated with it in terms of damages accrued.  A blackout occurs as a result of total system failure mainly due to catastrophic equipment malfunctioning or severe weather. A rolling blackout refers to controlled/planned service interruptions that last for fixed amount of time. A rolling blackout is usually initiated by utility companies.

==Laying of utilities==
[[Image:Minimum spanning tree.svg|thumb|200px|right|An example of a Minimum Spanning Tree. Weights on the links may  represent cost or time to lay each link]]
When laying utilities, the least cost solution is the one chosen. Whether the cost is in terms of time it takes to lay out utilities or the monetary cost to putting  infrastructure in place along the network, a system must be in place to analyze the cost-benefit ratio. For example, if a new power line for a particular area isn't needed in the immediate future, where there isn't a risk for brownouts/blackouts, the utility company may choose to go for the lowest monetary cost.  A more systematic approach to analyze the costs associated with laying utilities is using the concept of the [[w:Minimum spanning tree|Minimum Spanning Tree]] (MST) problem.
In a network such as the electrical grid, the MST problem involves using links to connect all nodes on the network. Ideally an arbitrary location is determined while selected which nodes to connect first. However, within an existing electrical network, the first node to be connected on a MST can be an existing node on the grid. Other steps include identifying unconnected node that is closest to the already connected nodes. Upon completing this process, add the new node to the set of connected nodes. The process is repeated until all nodes are connected. The result is having all nodes connected with the least cost&lt;ref&gt;Anderson et al (2000). An introduction to Management Science: Quantitative approaches to decision making. South Western College publishing&lt;/ref&gt;. For our graph the least cost to connect all the nodes is 38. On an electrical grid this could represent man hours required for complete connection to occur or a scaled cost for connections.

==Peak Hour Demand==
Meeting peak hour demand remains a challenge for utility companies. [[w: Peaking power plant|Peaker plants]] are often old power plants used to meet peak hour demand and due to their age and function, release higher concentrations of pollutants &lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Communities Attainable Results (CNT) http://www.cnt.org/news/media/isgi-summary-of-benefits-and-issues-6-08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Not only do peaker plants harm the environment more than plants that run continuously, but peak demand can vary considerably, causing brownouts and blackouts to still occur.
 
In the United States, the annual total electric industry revenues are estimated at $326 billion.  Yet, interruptions to the utility service are predicted to cost the industry $80 billion. These loses represent approximately 24.5 per cent of the industry revenues &lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Communities Attainable Results (CNT) http://www.cnt.org/news/media/isgi-summary-of-benefits-and-issues-6-08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Unfortunately, the costs are then transfer to the consumer with inflated energy prices. With a smart grid in place, not only would network reliability increase thereby reducing the costs to the industry, but these saving would be passed on to the consumer.  Changes in the current electrical grid will have to be gradual considering the vast resources that will be required to upgrade to a smart grid.

==Smart Grid==
According to Illinois SMART GRID Initiative, a smart grid refers to the modernization of the electric system through the integration of new information-age technologies to allow for new uses of the electric grid. This applies both in operations of the grid and in consumer applications&lt;ref&gt;Sustainable Communities Attainable Results (CNT) http://www.cnt.org/news/media/isgi-summary-of-benefits-and-issues-6-08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. Currently consumers receive their usage reports a couple of days after consuming electricity.  With a smart grid in place, consumers are able to monitor real-time usage of electricity and hence increasing awareness of their consumption. 
With increased awareness in consumption of electricity, it can be argued that consumers can manage use of electricity through use of ‘smart appliances’ that consume less power and also can be programmed to run during off peak periods. By running appliances during off-peak hours, it decreases the necessity for peak plants and uses energy being produced during those hours that is going to waste.  Running appliances that consume more power during off peak periods can be further encouraged if power consumption is to be charged according to time of day.  A similar analogy can be found in congestion pricing in transportation networks, where road users get to pay for ‘congestion’ caused as a result of their travel. 
The U.S Department of Energy (DOE) views the smart grid as an important tool to ensure the electric grid is reliable and maintain affordability while reinforcing global competitiveness&lt;ref&gt;US Energy Information Administration  (USEIA) http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epm/table1_1.html&lt;/ref&gt;. On the other hand the European Wind Energy Association (EWEA) views clean sources of energy as the next level of economic competitiveness&lt;ref&gt;European wind Energy http://www.ewea.org/index.php?id=885&lt;/ref&gt;.

== System Analysis and Design Guide for Education ==

Dear Adrignola,

My name is Nicu. I find the book quite interesting, especially Chapter 3 with application of System Analysis and Design principles to Information Systems in Education. Is there any place with online content where I can find a guide/systematic description of how to apply principles from System Analysis and Design principles to Information Systems in Education?

Thnak you for your answer.

Best regards

-Nicu

:I have found &quot;Innovation in Information Systems Education-IAccelerated Systems Analysis And Design With Appreciative Inquiry - An Action Learning Approach&quot; at the [http://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol15/iss1/17/ Communications of the Association for Information Systems] site.  Seems to be a pretty meaty topic. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:39, 31 March 2011 (UTC)


Dear Adrignola,

Thanks. But this is not really what I am looking for. In Chapter 3 of the online book you apply System Analysis and Design to different Education Information Technology Systems. Is there anywhere described how this can be done? (step 1, step 2, ... for Planning, Analysis, Design?) From where did you know how to apply it?

Thanks
-Nicu

:I'm not really sure which book you refer to on Wikibooks.  While I'm almost finished with a degree in Information Technology, this topic would be at a master's level rather than a bachelor's level.  I have done a lot of categorization of pages or general cleanup.  Maybe you saw my name in the history of a page as a result of that, but I don't recall writing anything on this topic. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:09, 3 April 2011 (UTC)
== Books based on Wikipedia articles - without enough attributions ==

There are a couple of books being created by copying paragraphs from different Wikipedia pages - [[An Introduction to Molecular Biology]] &amp; [[Principles_of_Biochemistry]]. We told the [[User_talk:Kaushlendratripathi|author]] how to give the required attributions in January, but he persists in leaving them out. How lenient do you think we should be? Are we accepting that - well it's only from Wikpedia, so it's not worth making a fuss? [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 19:30, 5 April 2011 (UTC)

:Since we had a discussion on this before and came to the conclusion that inline references (&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Permanent link to Wikipedia page&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;) would be all that is needed if pulling from quite a few Wikipedia pages, I think that we're already being quite lenient.  If there are no references, it's plagiarism and a copyright violation and should be deleted.  This system is actually superior to mixing up page histories with multiple imports and saves work for admins, but if the user won't even attribute, it's a violation of Wikipedia's license.  [[Wikibooks:Deletion_policy#Copyright_violations|Policy]] says anything that persists longer than a week without compliance with licensing following notification is fair game for removal.  We've already notified as you noted, so the time is up. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 19:53, 5 April 2011 (UTC)

::I suppose he might not have fully understood what was required or we might have spotted this earlier, so we could allow the usual 7-days to put things right. And he has &quot;created&quot; a new book and a lot of new pages since the original discussion, some of which might have a few attributions of the expected type. He has included references to external sources where these were part of the original article, but if inspected I expect nearly all of the material would be found to be lacking enough references to the Wikipedia pages. It's probably better than he deserves, but I could check the books page by page and flag them up separately to make sure we are not being unfair.

:The talk page was not protected against moves, strangely enough, unlike [[Cookbook talk:Table of Contents]] and [[Talk:Wikijunior]].  This despite the log stating it was in November 2005.  I was prompted to check the status given the two instances of vandalism in a short period of time.  Do you have a disagreement with the action? &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 02:58, 10 April 2011 (UTC)

:: I've no objections to what I now think you did.  My query was because I was having trouble deciphering the log.  I see you partially edit-protected it till tomorrow, and fully move-protected it indefinitely.  When I first looked at it, the best I could make out was you'd protected it indefinitely till tomorrow, which seemed a neat trick (and is reminiscent of a line from [[s:The Mikado/Act I/Part XI|The Mikado]]).  Though the 2005 log entry still seems a moderately neat trick, as it does not indicate that any specific protections were imposed; only the edit description makes any specific claim.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 04:52, 10 April 2011 (UTC)

== Wikijunior logo ==

Hello. I was wondering when the logo for Wikijunior would be uploaded. It's been a few years and the majority of the community has voted for the &quot;three people&quot; logo. --[[User:Turn685|Turn685]] ([[User talk:Turn685|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Turn685|contribs]]) 21:06, 17 April 2011 (UTC)
: The logo page is located [http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikijunior/Logo here]
:The file already exists on Commons, so it doesn't need uploading. I guess you mean used? Not convinced that the majority of the community have voted - participation was extremely low. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:12, 17 April 2011 (UTC)
:The logo was probably more relevant back when the idea was that Wikijunior would be split off from Wikibooks to http://wikijunior.org.  Now that it's clear that it's not likely to be, the discussion on the logo is an interesting one but not likely to have any actual impact on operations. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 22:22, 17 April 2011 (UTC)

Hi - I posted &quot;Introductory Chemistry Online&quot; last year, but it hasn't gone well.  I have lots of negative email pointing out errors and other issues.

Thanks...

== Style of attribution needed for books based on Wikipedia articles ==

Remember those books being created by copying paragraphs from different Wikipedia pages - [[An Introduction to Molecular Biology]] &amp; [[Principles_of_Biochemistry]]. We told the [[User_talk:Kaushlendratripathi|author]] how to give the required attributions in January, and more recently advised him to add permanent links to the Wikipedia pages. Apart from a few cases, he has only been adding links to the latest page without any version information. Obviously permanent links are best, but I suppose by comparing page histories you could in principle work out approximately which version was used as the source. Do we actually have a policy laid down which requires permanent links in references, or is this just a customary practice we recommend to people? [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 17:22, 20 April 2011 (UTC)

:It's a customary practice, like most things at Wikibooks (I don't recall ''any'' policies formulated during my time here). &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:32, 20 April 2011 (UTC)

:In my opinion it shouldn't need a policy because the requirement is based on the terms &amp; conditions of the licenses under which content is published rather than community decided policy. So, an unattributed copy / paste from Wikipedia breaks the license conditions. A copy / paste attributed by a link to the current article may comply with the license, but it is questionable because you can only infer what version of the content was copied based on timestamps in the edit history, and that isn't 100% accurate. For example, if I copy a paragraph now, paste it in, spend 5 minutes formatting then save then in that 5 minutes several edits could have been made to the Wikipedia source. So it isn't 100% certain when the copy was taken. And yes, I've never seen a policy formulated and I'm not complaining about it. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:39, 20 April 2011 (UTC)

::OK, I just wanted to get the story straight for when I talk to the author really. Regarding those books, I propose deleting the non-compliant pages and that the author should request undeletion of a few pages at a time according to the number he plans to fix over a 7 day period. If we wanted to be even stricter we could limit him to just 1 page at a time I suppose. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 22:08, 20 April 2011 (UTC)

:::I was making an effort not to get involved on this discussion but alas, I can't, as this is something that I already made an effort to show people that they are going out of their way to build up a minor issue in something that is destructive and disruptive.
:::Authorship (right of attribution) is different across projects, I expect that most of those already active on this issue understand the differences that exist between the two projects, what we (me and some of you) disagree (in different degrees and aspects) is on the reliability and factual usefulness of the edit history to ascertain real contributions and what contributions should be classified for authorship (and ultimately the need for attribution). I will try to avoid getting into the different issues and mention only the fallacy in this discussion...
:::The primary problem in regard to the Wikipedia copy and paste is both a legal requirement and to some degree a moral obligation.
:::The legal requirement can be solved easily by including a statement of attribution into the work, anyone can do this and to my knowledge we haven't been pressured by the Wikimedia to expedite or correct this requirement since both project belong to the same entity, the reason why a special attribution should be included is for stand alone copies of the work.
:::The moral obligation is hard to defend, since Wikipedia is different from Wikibooks, most if not all articles are in disaggregated form aren't copyrightable this and the dilution of contributions puts the expectation of contributors in getting attributions very low, I would even say inexistent if the awareness of this facts was generalized, this is again in high contrast to our own project. That said the importation of the edit history is great, should be promoted but I don't see the need to force or make it an obligation, or even as a factor that should merit such considerations it certainly is not a way to promote contributions and ease participation, most people will not bother to understand how it works or how to request it, so ultimately if the issue is bothering you, you should do it for them, not press them into compliance, of course you can also attempt to educate...
:::The other issue is that if a copy paste is detected and remains a duplicate, over some time (7 days it an extremely low time-frame to see any evolution) it should be deleted not as a copyvio but as simple duplication of an encyclopedic article, without causing harm to the work (the deletion should optimally be substituted by a link to the Wikipedia content).
:::One of the real issues I have with these deletions, that sometimes are not simple copies, is the lacking of a log on copyvios deletions...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 17:51, 21 April 2011 (UTC)
::::Panic, I disagree when you say &quot;The legal requirement can be solved easily by including a statement of attribution into the work...&quot;. I estimate a typical page in these books contain about 30 to 60 paragraphs each copied from between 5 and 15 different Wikipedia articles. That could add up to about 800 different links per book, so I think the best person to provide the information to satisfy the legal requirement must be the original author. 
::::Your suggestion to replace duplicated text by a link to the original article is also not practical as in many cases there is no link target in the Wikipedia article that corresponds to the exact paragraphs which were copied. Even if you could specify the start of a duplicated section, how would you specify the end of it? 
::::I agree with you that deletion of pages is rather harsh, but it seems to be all we can do when someone persists in ignoring the advice they have been given. Though, there is probably scope for improving our help pages to set out more clearly what level and style of attribution are expected for material copied from Wikipedia. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 20:12, 21 April 2011 (UTC)
:::::Well the best person to provide the information is always the owner of rights over the copied works, if he choses to exert those rights. That is the core problem we fall under as we preemptively act to protect the project as we tag stuff as copyvio, most times this is fine as we are &quot;protecting&quot; the project (even that can be argued against). I agree that it may be the lesser of the evils but in the case of Wikipedia content or even PD (or similar, that can require attribution) my view is that deletion is the greater evil, and forcing people to comply with our procedures just exacerbates the problem.
:::::As for the required attribution, placing a simple line stating that some content originated on Wikipedia will address the legal requirement, whatever the number of source articles, one could easily shortcut this discussion by placing said attribution on the work under discussion (since some other efforts have been put into it that would be wrong and non-productive but it would remove the &quot;obligation&quot; being forced on the contributor), of course that if the content is a simple replication then it should be prevented anyway, as I said above, but not on the argument of copyvio.
:::::This is why I argue that we shouldn't tag Wikipedia content as copyvio. If detected an educational effort can be made, tag the content with a similar but non deletionist template and if it is simply a copy and paste give it 30 days and then replace it with a link to Wikipedia if the content is duplicate (one should also take in consideration that at times content is moved from Wikipedia before deletion without any special procedures, or even a disputed version of a page, we as an independent project should not enforce or validate Wikipedia decisions in regards to our content), we can even announce on the talk page at Wikipedia that the content is being used as this does not prevent anyone to request an import of the edit history, but it removes barrier to sporadic contributors to understand complex procedures, subtle legal nuances and the inherent delay on the operation.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 20:38, 21 April 2011 (UTC)
::::::Panic, I would be interested to see if anyone else supports your claim that &quot;placing a simple line stating that some content originated on Wikipedia will address the legal requirement&quot;. If that is accepted, then the whole problem is easily solved. If not accepted, then we still have the practical problem of providing attribution for the 800 paragraphs or so in each book copied from various Wikipedia articles. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 21:10, 21 April 2011 (UTC)
:::::::See the C++ Programming work or any of the other projects I've contributed, all have complied with the attribution requirement in that way (mostly because at the time edit history couldn't be imported or the size of the used content was not significative), I also indicate those as I'm fully aware of what has been done, but I've seen similar atributions in other works...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 21:18, 21 April 2011 (UTC)
:::::::I can't pinpoint what content was used without some work but on my other major projects you can probably have an idea by examining my contributions around the time the attribution was added.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 21:22, 21 April 2011 (UTC)

:So, this is a complicated area not least because the licensing changed (the move from GFDL to CC-BY-SA). WMF lists the following relevant points:

:: ''As an author, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions: a) through a hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article or articles you contributed to, b) through a hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy which is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on this website, or c) through a list of all authors. (Any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions.) ''. This suggests a link just to the article '''might''' be enough, rather than the permanent link. However it then goes on to state
::''Indicate changes: If you make modifications or additions, you must indicate in a reasonable fashion that the original work has been modified. If you are re-using the page in a wiki, for example, indicating this in the page history is sufficient.''. This one is more challenging if there is no revision history imported and no link to the actual version copied. How are modifications determined?

::Anyway, I am not a lawyer. But I do think it is an abridgment of the moral rights of the original authors to have their work just pasted in here, without any link at all to the original source - and that's what is happening now. Recent Runes point is very valid, there's so much mixing up going on it's impossible to reasonably work out the original source unless the person editing here does it. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 22:08, 21 April 2011 (UTC)

:::I think that in that respect we are all in agreement (the defense of the source original author/s, noting however that the definition of author and how we recognize them is not consensual, and varies form jurisdiction, this is important as covered in previous discussions as it has legal relevance), but we all have no problem in recognizing and acknowledging every contribution. Because of this, no one seems to be objecting to the moral and optimal solution of importing the edit histories, the point I was putting forward is that edit histories aren't exactly the ultimate repository for determining authorship (authorship is claimed not attributed) or even every contribution in the evolution of a work (in opposition to what is normally implied), an in the relevance in regards to Wikipedia, the authorship and license of the project is distinct as are the expectations of attribution as I stated above and that in these cases forcing the compliance of editors is not necessary nor is it the optimal solution.
:::The last part of your rational also indicates the basis of the problem, since most of the contributors are mostly anonymous volunteers, even unreachable outside of the project, so the view that they can be forced into compliance is unrealistic and places a unnecessary burden on the rest of the community to detect and categorize the infringement, ultimately leading to unnecessary deletions. We already do a good effort in cases there is real legal implications and in those cases it can be said that it benefits the project and it is ultimately necessary to avoid cross pollination of works with illegal content, but in cases the content is free or license compatible the burden should be taken by those that really care about the legal and moral correctness and ultimately the content owners as it constitutes no risk to the project and the suppression of such usable content is ultimately detrimental to our project evolution, even more if it can in most cases be easily fixed at any time.
:::Note however that I'm making this points in relation to the policing and enforcing options available to administrators (most of those in this thread are discussing on how it should be enforced not in establishing an utopic guideline for all Wikibookians).   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:48, 21 April 2011 (UTC)
:::: Well, putting large philosophical issues aside, I think RecentRunes idea of deleting the non-compliant pages, the undeleting for the author to fix (assuming the author requests undeletion) is by far the reasonable approach to current problem at hand. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 23:04, 21 April 2011 (UTC)
::::: For what I remember deletions and undeletions have some costs (structural), there is also a problem of logging such deletion (if a log is maintained of copyvio deletions they become less problematic) and ultimatly there is the problem of alienating contributors (it all depends on how it is done).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:12, 21 April 2011 (UTC)
:::If a author is contributing to a wikipedia article then copyright remain to wikipedia/WMF not author. So if a person copying and writing it include content from wikipedia is legally right (Panic view). The best way to show attribution is as suggested by QU. I hope it will help.
:::thanks.......... lalsingh
::::The copyrights aren't never lost to Wikimedia foundation, they are licensed. Of course depending on the jurisdiction, in some places if the ownership is not claimed any copyrightable contribution defaults to the recognized existing authors (under US law this is not the case, so the use of the content hosted across WMF servers is not impacted by this, in other formats it can). But in the specific case of Wikipedia only the specific aggregation of the various encyclopedic articles is copyrightable (one can can and has been argued that some articles go beyond simple encyclopedic content, but these cases can be see as falling outside of the objective of Wikipedia).
::::In the case of the optimal attribution (the use of the edit histories) what I was pointing to is how we go about it. We can say that we are enforcing the deletion policy in forcing editors to be the ones that request the import process, but  there is another way to comply to the requirements, even if non optimal it protects the content (that at times is not simple duplication and if deleted will be lost), in place of blindly attempt to enforce rights that in the first place should be exerted by the owners. In other words we are treating free usable content in the same way we treat the infringements of non-free content with a clear losses to the project.
::::The fault of course is not on the requirements nor the practice it is on the copyright law itself, the abolishing of obligatory copyright statement that forces us to be preemptively protective of the project. If the statement was obligatory the practice would be more in line with how trade marks are protected, exclusively by the owners. It is a sad state of affairs when no one can easily identify public domain works, it is in fact the slow death of public domain since it becomes harder to determine the validity of the claimed ownership of non-free works.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 17:30, 22 April 2011 (UTC)

== Recipe conversion and baker's percent analysis ==

Hi Adrignola, I wanted to thank you for the welcome.  I have completed, or nearly so, an analysis of one volumetric recipe. Currently, I have posted it on my talk page, and was wondering if you had any comments?  I find a lot of errors in the recipe versus the type of bread I would have expected based upon the title, and I worry that adding it to the recipe itself, as the analysis currently exists, may be too harsh a critique. Frances Davey was correct in her/his observation that varying flour amounts from ambiguous cup volumes skews the entire formula. The recipe I picked included mL measures as well as cups, but it also called for a range of flour volumes instead of a precise amount. Because the analysis was performed in a spreadsheet, I was able to plug in some alternate numbers in various scenarios, and was surprised to see the variances largely disappear when the flour weights were the same.  Anyway, I'd be very interested in any comments about the analysis that you may have, particularly as it relates to whether it is appropriate for posting on the recipe page, or whether something more discreet is called for, such as the recipe's talk page. One problem is that if someone comes along and decides to edit the recipe, perhaps because they tested it in their kitchen (I can't do that with this recipe due to milk protein allergy, I need to eat all food I make), then decided to edit some of the values in the ingredient list, then the analysis table would also require a bit of calculation to correctly update. [[User:Gzuufy|Gzuufy]] ([[User talk:Gzuufy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Gzuufy|contribs]]) 02:11, 26 April 2011 (UTC)

:I'd say that harsh critiques are desirable, as improvements to the recipes are very helpful and that's the whole point of a wiki anyone can edit.  I'd suggest keeping the analysis on the same page as the percentages, but to avoid overwhelming the reader with the nitty gritty of its derivation, placing the content between [[Template:Hidden begin]] and [[Template:Hidden end]].  Those can be styled too, so a template specific to the Cookbook can be made with styles built-in, allowing you to call, say, [[Template:Analysis begin]], and not have to retype the styling.  The hiding of the detailed analysis with the percentage table still showing makes things more discreet while not relegating the clear work you put in to the talk page. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:17, 26 April 2011 (UTC)

::Okay, thank you.  I'm nearly certain I read your reply without all of its nuances fully comprehended, yesterday. Perhaps fatigue was involved. I updated the recipe itself, which puts the decision within moderators fields of expertise.  Presumably, some edits are not approved, and perhaps that would be best!

===ArosBootStrap===

Can I use the maproom on the blizzard if i change the address from 

# Main ROM (0xf80000 - 0xffffff)
ROMLOC_rom := 0x0f80000 to 0x4FF80000 - 4FF8ffff

Would i need to tell arosbootstrap or does this follow that pointer?
Arosbootstrap is not compatible with any kind of external address remapping.
That address is used to build normal 2x512K ROM images, arosbootstrap uses relocatable elf-image.

Note that  rom detects arosbootstrap mode and automatically uses MMU (if  available) to remap &quot;ROM&quot; to fast RAM if arosbootstrap originally loaded it in chip ram (happens when available fast RAM is not compatible, for example Blizzard A1200 accelerators' fast RAM has this problem because it is not autoconfig) Check the log for MMU messages.


It apparently has to be  UBYTE m68060[0x12]; 
Guess mc68060 conflicts with some other compiler variable when compiling for 68060 or something like that.
That union is only used to reserve space for largest FPU stack frame (68882), variable names are not important. (Perhaps prefix them with fpu_?)


Noticed a peculiar quirk of InternalLoadSeg_ELF. 

It was doing Seek() calls on the BPTR passed into it. Now, this in itself wasn't too strange, except for when the funcarray[] has an override for Read (see workbench/c/AddDatatypes.c) which operated on an in-memory data structure instead of a file.

As I also needed the in-memory seeking capability for loading GZIP compressed ELF files into RAM (don't ask), I modified InternalLoadSeg and friends to use a 4th funcarray member (overriding Seek) to provide this capability. 

PPC maintainers: Please double check my work to your files, and also, see if they can be merged back to rom/dos/internalloadseg_elf.c




===Shutdown===

Is Exec/ShutdownA(SD_ACTION_POWEROFF) defined for any Amiga machine? If so, what do I need to do to make that machine power off? There is no soft power hardware in any Amiga model. 

For other machines, what is the quickest way to make the screen go all black? (This is probably a copper list thing, right?). AFAIK each graphics driver installs a reset handler hook that blanks the screen. Reset handlers are probably not called upon ShutdownA(SD_ACTION_POWEROFF), but maybe they should be. 

Opening up windows seems to take a LOT of memory. Is AROS allocating a full bitmap for each window?!? Or am I opening them wrong? Some magic OpenWindow() tag that says 'no backing store'? 
Only Smartrefresh windows should use extra window bitmaps (at least on AOS). 

Turns out that Deallocate() NULL was the problem child. I've already committed a fix to make Deallocte() of NULL a no-op. I'll revert the UAEGfx change tonight. 




==Exec==

[http://fpc.freedoors.org/fpc-2.2.0.source/rtl/amiga/m68k/execf.inc Reference List]

what priv mode is task-&gt;tc_Launch(), task-&gt;tc_Switch(), and Exec/Exception() supposed to run in?

I would assume in User mode, but given that core_Dispatch can be called from Switch(), wouldn't that mean that tc_Launch() could be executed in Supervisor mode?

Other important missing part seems to be expansion.library autoconfig board handling (and tricky extra: exec/supervisor stack relocation to fast ram if fast ram detected.) Will be simpler than the Exec/Dispatch() and
Exec/Supervisor() implementations! 

However, you may want to look at the exec/child* family of calls, as it looks like they
are casting in a funny way, i.e.: 

 child = FindChild((ULONG)tid);

I don't know if this is safe for x86_64, I don't know your tid implementation.

A typical 68k asm coded PutChProc function does:

   move.b d0,(A3)+
   rts

A3 = PutChData (typically string buffer) and the function relies on getting back the modified A3 (pointing to next byte/char to be poked), the next time the PutChProc is called. 

Example: &quot;Hello&quot;, A3 = 0x100000

&lt;pre&gt;
call PutChProc(&quot;H&quot;, 0x100000)
call PutChProc(&quot;e&quot;, 0x100001)
call PutChProc(&quot;l&quot;, 0x100002)
call PutChProc(&quot;l&quot;, 0x100003)
call PutChProc(&quot;o&quot;, 0x100004)
&lt;/pre&gt;

So A3 is basically an input+output param, not just input param.

You can also try getting exec in real autoconfig fast ram (after ConfigChain() call) if you still have too much free time. Are you talking about moving the &quot;Boot Task&quot; stack, or moving all of Exec out of ROM and into RAM? 
No, I meant execbase only. Official 2.0+ ROMs move execbase to real  autoconfig fast (instead of 0xc00000 slow ram) ram if it exists. This is done because Chip RAM and &quot;slow ram&quot; (which actually has exactly same speed as chip ram) are relatively slow on real Amigas. That's pretty easy to do then. I'll add it as an arch function to either rom/expansion or rom/strap. 



About dynamic relocation:

I am attempting to load relocatable 1M rom image to end of available fast RAM. Technically it already works but there is problem with autoconfig ram boards that disappear during reset. (UAE Z3 board does not, at least in WinUAE, A3000/A4000 motherboard ram is also &quot;safe&quot;) 

1: Let original KS (which is in ROM) do the autoconfig stuff and add coolcapture/kicktag hack that copies ConfigDevs to AROS expansion list. - aros autoconfig implementation is unused. This won't help use to find any bugs. - KS expansion behavior may have undocumented features that can break the copy-phase..

2: Put coldcapture/kicktag to chipram that points to aros expansion.library (also in chip ram). It runs autoconfig first phase (enabling the ram board where &quot;rom&quot; is located), stores the data in chip ram, jumps to aros rom which detects this situation and only collects the autoconfig data without rerunning autoconfig again. - is it possible to have separate relocatable file that only contains expansion.library? (Jason?) - can't use any exec routines, some patching needed.. (just use absolute chip ram addresses, no one cares, they are temporary anyway) 
(yes, I know that chipram also temporarily gets replaced by rom when reset is executed but this can be worked around, even on a 68000 without crashing. One game even used this as part of copy protection..) 

3: just copy current autoconfig data and jump to rom image in ram without reset. Works only once (any reset kills it), any boot rom boards are not visible to aros rom. Too stupid for my tastes :) 

Option 2 is not easy but it would be compatible with all Amiga models (as long as it has at least 1M of fast ram). Testing is too difficult for &quot;normal&quot; users as long as it needs specific hardware or eprom burner. (Unfortunately you have autoconfig ALL boards, you can't choose specific RAM board, unless that ram board is first board in autoconfig chain but I don't think you can assume that..) 

How does WHDLoad do it? Can we generate a ROM image/relocation map WHDLoad can use? It uses .RTB files that are also some kind of relocation files (afaik they were originally used by some rom image loader). 
But personally I'd prefer everything in single file, it is  too easy to mix different versions (perhaps even the loader should be included, titanics cruncher like &quot;pseudo-overlay&quot; file is easy to create). 
Anyway, I don't really care much until I have working expansion.library autoconfig hack (+ Gayle IDE driver port). 

Removed the softint check (r36842) in m68k-amiga Disable() and moved all processing to Cause() because m68k
Disable() and Enable() should be as short and as fast as possible. Softints are &quot;automatic&quot; when using Paula interrupts, there is no need to check them in each Enable() call. 
(m68k-amiga interrupt processing probably should be completely in assembly, it needs to be really optimized if this thing is going to be useful on A500.. But it is much too early now.) 


The crash occurs when sprintf() is called. Isn't sprintf() in arosc.library?
Of course, you could always replace that with a call to RawDoFmt() and remove the arosc.library dependency.
I have half a mind to do that for all of workbench/c anyway (remove the arosc.library dependency)


The AOS 3.1 iPrefs utility patches into RawDoFmt() for localization, and doesn't understand the AROS 'magic' constants:

* RAWFMTFUNC_STRING
* RAWFMTFUNC_SERIAL
* RAWFMTFUNC_COUNT

 Would anyone mind if I made those 'magic constants' point to real m68k functions on AROS m68k, for better 3.1 support? It changes the magic constants for m68k to point to functions, but continues to support the 'NULL == RAWFMTFUNC_STRING' assumption of AOS 4.x and Morphos.

Load up locale.library, have it patch AROS' RawDoFmt and then patch it too, with a wrapper that properly translates the special codes into real functions. Before exiting SetPatchAROS remember to unpatch RawDoFmt before unloading locale.library. I like that more than a pop-up. It'll be a little hacky in Exec/SetFunction, but doable. 

So WB locale.library SetFunction()'s RawDoFmt() and then AROS programs that need non-AOS extensions (RAWFMTFUNC_STRING and others) stop working, right? 
Extending RawDoFmt() was bad idea. RawDoFmt() should only do what original Autodocs say and all AROS programs should use VNewRawDoFmt() 
Solution: replace or add wrapper macro that wraps all AROS RawDoFmt() calls with VNewRawDoFmt().
Well, while that does fix the WB on AROS  issue, it makes AROS userspace on AOS ROM pretty much impossible (out of room in the AOS exec.library vector space), unless SetPatchAROS relocates and extends exec.library. In that case, I might as well make an external 'exec.library' that replaces the AOS one.

The Facts:

* AROS RawDoFmt() accepts 'special' PutChFunc vectors 0, 1, and 2 
* AOS RawDoFmt() assumes that PutChFunc always points to a valid function
* AOS locale.library uses SetFunction() to update Exec/RawDoFmt() to one with AOS PutChFunc conventions


&lt;pre&gt;
APTR realRawDoFmt;

AROS_UFP4(fixupRawDoFmt, blah, blah)
{
     If PutChProc is a magic vector, make it a real function.
     Call realRawDoFmt;
}
... Exec/SetFunction (AROS) ...

if (library_to_patch == SysBase &amp;&amp; function_to_patch == LVO_RawDoFmt) {
     realRawDoFmt = vector_of_patch;
     vector_of_patch = fixupRawDoFmt;
}

Set library_to_patch -&gt; function_to_patch = vector_of_patch
&lt;/pre&gt;

That's actually even better than what I had in mind, since it doesn't depend on locale.library, but anything that attempts to patch RawDoFmt() will get the wrapper around it. If you don't consider hackish patching SetFunction() itself. What happens now when AROS' locale.library patches RawDoFmt? It goes through the magic to real function translator fixup too, which adds 16 more m68k instructions to every call. We will move all the m68k specific stuff in rom/exec/setfunction.c to arch/m68k-all/exec/setfunction.c, that way it'll actually end up as a 'cleanup' for the other architectures. Should these AOS compatibility hacks be clearly marked or put inside some ifdefs? (They should be easily found or someone will sooner or later forget about them completely and it will get quite confusing..) Putting extensive comments into arch/m68k-all/exec/setfunction.c 

Only one problem I can think of:

* Someone who tries to replace RawDoFmt will remove the chain instead and get unconverted values in his replacement.
* Someone who happens to chain RawDoFmt to catch exactly the same values will have to actually receive them

But from the call, we can't tell the chaining apart from the replacement, so how do we know if we have to add a converter patch to that patch as well?

Is a very minor issue, so it's a matter of whether we want guaranteed full compatibility, or just a good approximation.


Plus, I don't think there's any unpatching. I'm not sure whether that is going to cause notable problems.

But if VNewRawDoFmt uses those constants, doesn't it have to check against them? For comparison it wouldn't matter that they are really static function pointers. And being symbolical, comparison is the only operation allowed for recognising them. 

Since AOS doesn't have the extended task structures, this code sets acpd = NULL-&gt;iet_acpd 
Fix arosc not to use private fields in task structure. You  can  use  AVL trees for association (OS3.5+). Or duplicate these functions in arosc statically. Remember also that arosc.library relies on some other AROS extensions like NewAddTask() and NewStackSwap(). 

ACPI. Kernel/exec init is tricky, it perhaps can't be done at once. Exec is already    initialized    twice  (and  even  thrice,  if  we  count kernel.resource pickup). Kernel.resource should be initialized at 127 priority because in future even AllocMem() won't work without it (it will work on top of kernel's page allocator). 




===SAD debug===

For debugging before PrepareExecBase. For  this  purpose  you  have own bug() macro in kernel_debug.h. 
For very early debugging in kernel.resource you  can  use  kernel's  own  bug()  definition which statically calls
KrnBug(). It doesn't use exec in any way. And exec's facilities are up and running after calling exec's init code, which fills in KernelBase. Note that  no  other  code  than  kernel.resource's startup code can be run before PrepareExecBase(). Remember also KrnPutChar() and internal krnPutC(). 

How do I enable SAD early? I currently have a (poorly licensed) m68k-gdbstub I'm using to provide debugging to my ROM that has to go when I commit. Implement KrnPutChar() and KrnMayGetChar() in your kernel.resource and it will work. Note  that  Alert() will not call it because current alert routine is very basic and does not  process any input. This is done because there's no universal input hardware on PC. In fact this needs to be
worked on. Perhaps alert needs to take over the screen, print information on it, then take over input and ask for some command from it. RFC, I wrote about debug channels is one small step towards implementing this mechanism.
 
For list review. This patch enables the '--with-paranoia' ./configure option, and gives an example usage in rom/exec.


Semantics:

./configure                         =&gt; No paranoia
./configure --with-paranoia         =&gt; PARANOIA_CFLAGS=-Wall -W -Werror
./configure --with-paranoia=-Wmega  =&gt; PARANOIA_CFLAGS=-Wmega

This allows (a) no changes to the build process, (b) devs to enable paranoia *for themselves* and (c) devs to enable
paranoia *only* on targets they think are clean. This way, once all the -Wall issues on a library are cleared, it will stay that way. 

People use different compiler version(*) and those versions report different warnings - for example right now the 4.4 series reports *tons* of strict aliasing problem when compiled without debugging. We would probably end up in situation that a certain module build for 9 out of 10 people but the unlucky 1 person is not capable or not inclined to do the fixes.

Whilst agreeing with some of the warnings in -Wall. Some of them can be wrong (e.g. &quot;variable x may not be
initialised&quot;), or try to enforce a particular coding style (e.g. &quot;consider using parentheses around assignment used as truth value&quot;). 

We're aiming to avoid the use of -fno-strict-aliasing for performance reasons. 

I think USER_CFLAGS is overused in the mmakefiles; IMO it should only be used in special occasions when a certain symbol needs to be defined etc. Most programs/libs should be compiled with the default CFLAGS as generated by configure.

&lt;/pre&gt;
BRA := &quot;\(&quot;
KET := &quot;\)&quot;

TST := &quot;test$(BRA)test$(KET) test&quot;

USER_CFLAGS := -DDEFINE=\&quot;$(TST)\&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

or 

&lt;pre&gt;
USER_CFLAGS := -DDEFINE=\&quot;test\(test\)\ test\&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Is the backslash after the last bracket really necessary though? I thought it was only needed to specify that the following character was a special case? Yes, it's needed to escape the space and make the whole thing one command-line argument.

Additionally you would not need to duplicate debugging functions. And one more, about GDB stubs. May be you should consider integrating it  into  existing  SAD somehow? Ability to debug any machine remotely with gdb would be very nice. Unfortunately, gdb stubs are very machine specific. I believe they would need to be rewritten for every port. I plan to remove the GDB stubs once I get to the point where SAD works.

Unfortunately, gdb stubs are very machine specific. I believe they would need to be rewritten for every port. I plan to remove the GDB stubs once I get to the point where SAD works. Well, SAD really needs face-lift then. It's very old thing.

This  message  is  addressed mainly to Jason and Toni. If you look at arch/all-&lt;cpu&gt;/include/aros/&lt;cpu&gt;/cpucontext.h,   i've   written   CPU context definitions for all architectures except m68k. A pointer to such a structure will be used in two places: 

* It is passed as third argument to kernel exception handlers (added using KrnAddExceptionHandler()).
* It   is   passed   as  second  argument  to  exec  trap  handler (tc_TrapCode).

The  primary  purpose  of  this is to unify and extend crash handling code,  and  provide  possibilities for third party developers to write debugging tools which can catch exceptions and analyze task state. PowerPC  context  is  binary  compatible with AmigaOS4. I expect m68k context to be binary compatible with m68k AmigaOS. I know that on m68k
 tc_TrapCode  gets the whole context frame on the stack, this should be the  only  difference  to  other  ports.  I. e. on m68k we should take context pointer as follows: 

&lt;pre&gt;
void MyTrapHandler(ULONG trapCode)
{
     struct   ExceptionContext   *regs   =   (struct  ExceptionContext *)(&amp;trapCode + 1);

     ... process exception here ...
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Also    you'll    need    to    write    m68k-specific    cpu_init.c, KrnCreateContext()   and   PrepareContext().   Please  look  at  other architectures for examples. 

Short explanation:

* kb_ContextSize  needs  to  be  set to the total size of your context.
* kb_ContextFlags can be used for any purpose you want. i386 and ARM use it  to  specify  FPU type. Perhaps you won't need it at all because on m68k  you  have  SysBase-&gt;AttnFlags.  These  two  variables are set by cpu_init.c, which performs startup-time CPU probe. 

KrnCreateContext() allocates context frame and sets some initial data (if  needed).  The  common  use is to create initial FPU frame. Common part   of   your  CPU context should be sizeof(struct AROSCPUContext). This  is  needed  for hosted ports because on hosted you need to store some   host-specific  private data as part of CPU context. If you look 
at  hosted  CPU  definitions you'll see struct ExceptionContext in the beginning of struct AROSCPUContext. On native you are expected just to: 

 #define AROSCPUContext ExceptionContext

Optional  data (like FPU context) follow struct AROSCPUContext in the same block. 

PrepareContext()   is  not changed, i just expanded all macros. Since the  context  is unified, you don't need to define the same macros for every port any more. 

The  only  legacy  macros still needed in kernel_cpu.h are GET_PC and SET_PC.  They  are  used  by exec's crash handler. They will disappear after some time. PRINT_CPU_CONTEXT in fact prints useless crap, so you may safely remove it. Debug() will work without it. 

should remember that BPTRs don't really exists on (all?) other ports.. 

&gt; struct ExceptionContext

This is public form of AROS-side context. This is what AROS exception handlers except to get. It is identical on all architectures using the same CPU. 

&gt; regs_t

This is raw stack frame produced by CPU. On hosted AROS it's an alias to  host  OS  context  structure.  On  native  it  can be identical to ExceptionContext. 

&gt; struct AROSCPUContext

ExceptionContext  +  private  part.  Makes sense on hosted (where you save host-specific stuff). On native it is expected to be identical to ExceptionContext. struct AROSCPUContext contains struct ExceptionContext  in  the
beginning. 

&gt; ucontext

UNIX name of context. regs_t is an alias of it on UNIX-hosted. 

&gt; I'm trying to get m68k to be similar to all the rest of the architectures, but there's been a lot of churn in the trap/exeception area, and too little documentation (or, at least, I don't know where the documentation is). 

This  is newly designed thing. I provided some comments in the source code, i hope this is enough. I'm sorry, i currently have too little of time and even can't read the mailing list actively. The  main  idea  of what is done is unification of CPU context format per  single  CPU.  So  struct ExceptionContext is the same on the same CPU, no matter if it's hosted or native system. Yes, i studied AmigaOS exec trap handling, i know about the quirk. I would
suggest to use asm stub for it. I commented this in the code. 

Please put the indicator FIXME or TODO in your comment for things that need attention later. It makes it easier to find it back later and not forget about it. f.ex. 

&lt;pre&gt;
    /* fetch Task pointer before function call because A6 can change inside initialPC
     * (FIXME: temporary hack) */
&lt;/pre&gt;

Add MoveExecBase() that m68k-amiga port can use to move exec from chip/slow ram to autoconfig real fast.
Out of curiosity: Does this give any improvements on WinUAE or is it targeted at real hardware?
Real hardware, execbase or any other commonly accessed system structure in chip ram (or &quot;slow&quot; ram) can cause noticeable slowdown compared to real (accelerator board) fast ram, especially on accelerated OCS/ECS Amigas.

16-bit OCS/ECS chip RAM vs accelerator 32-bit fast ram speed difference can be huge, also chip ram is not cacheable.

KS 2.0 was first official ROM that introduced this exec transfer to fast ram feature.

(This will get really tricky if we want working reset proof programs)





===Scheduler===

You need to use the existing kernel.resource. It already has complete scheduler, you just need to write CPU-specific code and you're done. Look at the core_* code in rom/kernel/kernel_schedule.c. 

Note that in future there can be better scheduler (remember about KrnSetScheduler() function). One more note: startup code (start.c) in boot directory should IMHO better be in kernel directory because it is actually a part of kernel.resource. 

Look at Windows-hosted and UNIX-hosted ports. They are the most recent and they are engineered using the latest model. x86-64 and PPC ports are just older, they don't use common code, but they served as a base for my implementation. I just didn't rewrite them because i don't have these machines and can't test it. 
In  fact boot directory contains an external bootstrap program, which is supposed to load the kickstart image into machine's RAM and execute it.  On  Amiga kickstart is in ROM, and it doesn't need any bootloader (well, it might have one if you leave an option not to reflash the ROM but reckick the Amiga programmatically, in this case kickstart swapper will be your bootstrap).

I wrote it when I finished [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Aros/Developer/Docs/Resources/Kernel kernel.resource]  rewrite. It is still incomplete in places and lacks porting HOWTO. 

Make sure task switches are done only when returning from supervisor to user mode, but not when returning from supervisor to supervisor (interrupt inside interrupt). x86 native had a similar disappearing task problem looooong ago, caused by buggy &quot;do we return to usermode or not&quot; check in exitintr handling. 
The code in arch/m68k-amiga/kernel/amiga_irq.c only calls core_ExitInterrupt() when returning to user mode. 
Of course, I could be wrong. I would appreciate a second set of eyes to look at my arch exec and kernel code, now that I more closely conform to the standard conventions.
Syscalls are handled in amiga_irq.c (via the F-Line trap) and only for User Mode, all other interrupts either trap to the debugger or (for Paula IRQs) go through the Paula handler in amiga_irq.c 

Under a slow processor it is more visible and task switching must as fast as possible. It had nothing to do with scheduler, problem was too low handler process priorities. Too low priority dos packet handlers and someone using all CPU time = console and filesystem io crawls. You can easily confirm it on AOS by changing all handler processes' priorities to zero or lower :) 




===Sysbase===

In the expansion.library and scsi.device, there appear to be specially crafted 16-bit illegal instructions, that the 'original' Exec would look for and set D0 appropriately for after trapping them. Is there any documentation anywhere for these 'illegal instruction' traps? 
You must be using Amiga Forever 3.x ROM(s), they have at least one special illegal instruction to make it incompatible with real Amigas (UAE has a rom-check hack that fixes this..).  AFAIK it was part of license, rom images must not work on real Amigas. Make sure you have real original kickstart rom image. 

The solution is to make sure that when you have that 'SysBase' is the global, not a local copy.
 SysBase = PrepareExecBase(...)

One small question: why do you think PrepareExecBase() should not set global SysBase?
I  remember  once  i  also  came up with such an idea, just because i thought  that it doesn't look good. After changing this i realized how wrong am i. 
Many  things  in  unexpected  places  may  rely  on global SysBase. I remember  i  had  early  debug  output  somewhere,  and this broke it. Perhaps  that  output is even not there any more, but this proved that
the  idea  was  bad.  Global  SysBase  should  be  set  up as early as possible. This means - before PrepareAROSS. 
misled by how PrepareExecBase() was returning SysBase, and all of its callers where using it as 'SysBase = PrepareExecBase()'. It just looked like a typo that PrepareExecBase() was missing a local 'struct ExecBase *SysBase'.
Maybe PrepareExecBase() should return void, so that its callers have to *explicitly* pick up the global SysBase?

Also, is goUser() supposed to drop down to user privs always, or restore the privs that were there before goSuper()?
It switches to user mode. There's also goBack() definitions which jumps to previous mode remembered by goSuper().

One last thing - what priv mode is task-&gt;tc_Launch(), task-&gt;tc_Switch(), Launch   and   Switch  callbacks  are  called  directly  from  within supervisor,  and  i believe it's okay, and i think original Amiga does the  same.  Anyway  you  are not going to do something long-running in these callbacks.

and Exec/Exception() supposed to run in? Exception()  (unlike  in  AmigaOS)  is  called when all arch-specific
preparations  are  already  done,  and  you  are in usermode in task's context. This code just checks signals and calls appropriate routines, it does not contain any arch-specific code. 

In   order   to  process an exception correctly you need to save your task's  context  (which cpu_Dispatch() is going to jump to) somewhere, and  then  adjust  the  context  so  that your task jumps to exception handler.  The  handler  should call exec's Exception(), then it should pick  up  the  original  task's  context  (one  that you saved in your cpu_Dispatch()) and jump to it.

The result looks like your task just calls its exception handler. You  may  look  at  Windows-hosted  implementation  as  an example of working  one.  UNIX-hosted  implementation  does not work (at least on PPC). On native ports exceptions also don't work. Just  note  that  on  m68k-native  you 100% know what's going on your stack  so  you  don't  need  to that trick with passing context to exception handler. You may save it right on task's stack instead (this is what UNIX-hosted version does and this is why it doesn't work). 





===Interrupts===

With my last change (where I remembered to re-enable the hardware interrupts before going to CPU idle state in cpu_Dispatch()), I appear to be able to get to the KickStart 1.3 Intuition idle loop. 

However, it appears I am missing something, because (other than a pretty white screen) I get nothing more.

I *think* I need to call either KS's &quot;strap&quot; or &quot;romboot.library&quot;, or AROS's &quot;dosboot.library&quot;, but I'm not quite sure *where* to call those from. FWIW, AROS's strap is called as a result of it being in the resident list (at priority -50). See rom/boot/strap.c. 

The strap module does the disk block read in a real rom before dos initialization, it does not appear to be very well documented. 




===Semaphores===

I'm having some structure layout issues, since I am getting corruption of the MH free lists when I am trying to init the KickStart 3.0 libraries from AROS exec. (Oddly enough, they seem to init quite a bit. The memory corruption occurs in expansion.library after a call to Exec/InitSemaphore, and another that seems near the Graphics/Screen
OpenScreen when called by Intuition - probably both the same structure)&gt; A good source for amiga os 3.1 are the .i includes are a good reference for the byte-level layout of AmigaOS structures? (i.e. SignalSemaphore, etc.). 

Does your compiler use WORD (2 byte) alignment for LONGs etc. as expected by AOS? If not you may need to have the headers like in AOS4/MOS where they surround stuff with: 

&lt;pre&gt;
#pragma pack(2)

[...]

#pragma pack()
&lt;/pre&gt;

NewAddTask wants to align the stack to 16 bytes. I've turned that off in AROS_FLAVOUR_BINCOMPAT for now. 
This alignment is need for e.g. PPC ports. Of course other ports might not need it. 

I've noticed on KS 3.1 that some callers of Exec/InitStructure set bit 16 of the size field to 1. Don't know why. For now, I have to mask that out (which limits InitStructure to only being able to handle structures up to 64k in size). 

That's likely a case of a function where the original function only looks at the lower 16 bits even if the library prototype for the param says LONG or ULONG. So the upper 16 bits may contain trash and some other code may rely on that (== actually have trash in upper 16 bits when calling the function). 

One can see this also in other places, like graphics.library. There in some functions we use

  x = (WORD)x

(FIX_GFXCOORD macro) to kill trash in upper 16 bits.

E.g. if the prototype is LONG, the intended value width is WORD and the passed trash is &lt; 0, then why should the typecast be sufficient?

 x = (WORD) (x &amp; 0x0000FFFF)

to be sure that you only get the lower 16 bit?
I tried on x86 (gcc 4) and 68k (gcc 2.95) where it works.

&lt;pre&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
void func(int param)
{
    int fixed = (short)(param);
    printf(&quot;%d (%x) %d (%x)\n&quot;, param, param, fixed, fixed);
}
int main(void)
{
    func(0xF234fffe);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
-231407618 (f234fffe) -2 (fffffffe)

You are right - when converting from (unsigned or signed) long to (unsigned or signed) short the C rule seems to be to preserve the low-order word. Personally I do prefer the &quot;&amp;&quot; notation, as it shows exactly what is done, instead of keeping in mind what the compiler is known to do by some implicitely defined convention.

===Memory===

During   fixing   up  i386-pc  exec  initialization  i again came across SysBase-&gt;MaxLocMem.  AmigaOS  3.x  NDK  describes  it  as &quot;Max
ChipMem amount&quot;.  If  so, why can't it be set by examining MemList and summing up all  MEMF_CHIP  memory  size?  Why  is there some magic dance with addresses? What is exactly its value? And  the  same question about MaxExtMem. I'd like to try to implement it correctly once for all platforms. 

MaxLocMem is amount of chip ram (equals last address + 1 of chip ram on AOS)

MaxExtMem is last address + 1 (not size!) of &quot;slow&quot;/&quot;ranger&quot; RAM (0x00C00000) only. No slow RAM = NULL. It never includes any other local
RAM regions. 

I don't think these were designed to support multiple memory regions.




===Devices===

Documentation (and prototype files) say return type is BYTE but many programs (including WB1.3 system/setmap) assume LONG return type. Both KS1.3 and 3.1 OpenDevice() fetch io_Error and then extends it
(EXT.W D0 + EXT.L D0) to LONG before returning it. Which one is wrong, documentation or implementation? (or neither? :)) 

(m68k-amiga port already has hack that extends OpenDevice() return code but it gets overwritten by dos  lddemon hook) 

in rom/dos/endnotify.c:

    /* get the device pointer and dir lock. The lock is only needed for
     * packet.handler, and has been stored by it during FSA_ADD_NOTIFY */
    iofs.IOFS.io_Device = (struct Device *) notify-&gt;nr_Handler;
    iofs.IOFS.io_Unit = (APTR)notify-&gt;nr_Reserved[0];

The 'iofs.IOFS.io_Unit' is a pointer, and notify-&gt;nr_Reserved[0] is ULONG.

This code location and FSA_ADD_NOTIFY need to handle 64-bit pointers.

No workaround at present.


In rom/dos/deviceproc.c:

&lt;pre&gt; 
/* all good. get the lock and device */
   SetIoErr(dvp-&gt;dvp_Lock);
   res = dvp-&gt;dvp_Port;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The problem is that dvp-&gt;dvp_Lock is a BPTR, which can't be (safely) cast to a LONG under x86_64. As his function is marked as obsolete, I'm thinking that it should just throw a ERROR_DEVICE_NOT_MOUNTED on x86_64.
I'm not sure how workable this would be, probably we did lots of assumptions throughout the whole codebase to make this an easy feat, but one idea would be to consider a BPTR as an opaque handler: on x86 it would just be a pointer alright, for speed purposes, whilst on other architectures that don't allow such an &quot;optimization&quot; it could be a key into a dictionary of some sort (implemented with an hash table, a binary tree, or something like that).

Would there be any harm in making pr_Result2 an SIPTR instead?

this is our &quot;old&quot; (not used) USB stack in trunk/contrib/necessary/USB: classes/HID    classes/MassStorage stack/stubs. Current stack is in rom/poseidon. The old one is used in ppc-efika, though, that port isn't working at the moment. On the other hand I hope to make some progress for the sam port. 

Does anyone happen to know what the IECLASS_TIMER tick rate of input.device on AmigaOS was? 
(Google and the Autodocs have been very unhelpful - they only say that IECLASS_TIMER is a 'timer event', but don't say at what rate the events occur). It's set to once very 100 milliseconds in AROS. Is that correct? Or should it be the VBlank rate? Or slower? 





====Trackdisk.device====

MFM decoding and some simple hardware poking (Paula and CIA) needed.

For cia, the skeleton should remain in rom/cia afaik - you should just add the amiga specific files into arch/m68k-amiga/cia and use the %build_archspecific macro to override initial files with architecture specific.

disk.resource GetUnit() never enables disk dma finished interrupt. It only &quot;worked&quot; because serial transmit and disk interrupt use same interrupt level..  It is trackdisk.device that enables interrupt. 

Error appears if I add arch/m68k-amiga/cia directory and put my
amiga-specific files there (seticr.c and ableicr.c for example)

Target is amiga-m68k.

arch/m68k-amiga/cia/mmakefile.src is simple:

include $(TOP)/config/make.cfg

FILES := seticr ableicr
USER_CFLAGS := -I$(SRCDIR)/rom/cia

%build_archspecific \
  mainmmake=kernel-cia maindir=rom/cia arch=amiga-m68k \
  files=$(FILES) modulename=cia


trackdisk.device should be located in...  m68k-amiga/devs/

and HIDDs in...  m68k-amiga/hidd/

and resources on the other hand go directly to m68k-amiga - believe this maps the layout of AROS/rom directory 

&quot;Retro&quot;-specific question: how are we supposed to configure ROM for &quot;compatible&quot; mode/model specific configuration, for example unexpanded A500? ROM must not use too much RAM for advanced stuff (for example trackdisk.device must not allocate DMA buffer for HD drives, 15k vs 30k is huge difference in chip ram usage. Currently I do this dynamically,
reallocate HD sized buffer only if HD disk is inserted, note that HD drives report being DD unless HD disk is inserted). 

Not too important today but free ROM that can boot most A500 games and demos is my goal :)
(full compatibility is of course impossible, some very old games even jump directly to ROM..)

I also noticed (previously I didn't know it was that bad) that M68k code produced is really terrible, inefficient and looooonng.. (hopefully only because of options used?) 

Code that reads drive IDs (from  my disk.resource  implementation):

&lt;pre&gt;
void readunitid_internal (struct DiscResource *DiskBase, LONG unitNum)
{
    volatile struct CIA *ciaa = (struct CIA*)0xbfe001;
    volatile struct CIA *ciab = (struct CIA*)0xbfd000;
    UBYTE unitmask = 8 &lt;&lt; unitNum;
    ULONG id = 0;
    int i;

    ciab-&gt;ciaprb &amp;= ~0x80; // MTR
    ciab-&gt;ciaprb &amp;= ~unitmask; // SELx
    ciab-&gt;ciaprb |= unitmask; // SELX
    ciab-&gt;ciaprb |= 0x80; // MTR
    ciab-&gt;ciaprb &amp;= ~unitmask; // SELx
    ciab-&gt;ciaprb |= unitmask; // SELX
    for (i = 0; i &lt; 32; i++) {
        ciab-&gt;ciaprb &amp;= ~unitmask; // SELx
        id &lt;&lt;= 1;
        if (!(ciaa-&gt;ciapra &amp; 0x20)) // RDY
            id |= 1;
        ciab-&gt;ciaprb |= unitmask; // SELX
    }
    if (unitNum == 0 &amp;&amp; HAVE_NO_DF0_DISK_ID &amp;&amp; id == 0)
        id = 0xffffffff;
    DiskBase-&gt;dr_UnitID[unitNum] = id;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

result is this: (start and end removed)

No address relative CIA addressing, move to register, do operation, write it back.. Can't get any worse.
Why does it use address registers as counters (subaq.l #1,a1; cmpa.w #0,a1? 
You have used volatile keyword, so every operation on ciaprb is executed!

Consider:
&lt;pre&gt;
    ciab-&gt;ciaprb &amp;= ~0x80; // MTR
    ciab-&gt;ciaprb &amp;= ~unitmask; // SELx
&lt;/pre&gt;
to be replaced with
&lt;pre&gt;
    ciab-&gt;ciaprb &amp;= ~(0x80 | unitmask); // MTR, SELx
&lt;/pre&gt;
and the generated code will be shorter... ;)

Change &quot;int i&quot; to &quot;UBYTE i&quot;, since you're counting from 0 to 31 only. Otherwise you force gcc to allocate a 32 bit register for you :

I meant why it didn't create simple and short:
&lt;pre&gt;
and.b #$7f,$bfd100
and.b d0,$bfd100
&lt;/pre&gt;
(or even better, put bfd100 in some address register and do and.b #$7f,(a0))

Many data registers are totally unused. Does volatile force totally-completely-as-unoptimized-as-possible code? :) 
sure! It forbids any excessive optimizations, since the state of variable can always change in unpredicted way. Register described by volatile keyword will be accessed as many times, as your code suggests :P 






===Handlers===

The con-handler steers the Shell's I/O to the console.device which draws output in a window and reads input from the keyboard. The con-handler used to open the window and pass it to the console.device, but now the console.device does it. The con-handler still handles name-completion, command history, etc., but has been changed considerably.

The console.device opens the display, reads the keyboard, handles the display history, multiple consoles in the one window (tabs), the menu, etc. It has been restructured and largely rewritten.

I managed to get dos packets working yesterday (mainly functions that are needed at startup,like open/lock, examine, getdeviceproc, assignlock) Lock and Open are using FileLock and FileHandle structures. 

UAE FS boots until first executable is run, also CON needs to be converted soon. 

But reason I posted this: NIL handler.

It is not possible to create NIL handler because CreateProcess() needs NIL: which needs CreateProcess() and so on... Original NIL &quot;handler&quot; is nothing more than Open() checking for &quot;NIL:&quot; and returning FileHandle with fh_Type = NULL (packet port). 

Question is: does this cause issues with other ports? If yes, how to solve it? (some kind of special CreateProcess () needed?) There is a NULL handler filesystem on the Aminet but I haven't looked at it in years.  http://aminet.net/package/util/batch/NULL-Handler could be a possibility since it comes with source.  The difference between NULL: and NIL: is that NIL: is a dummy filesystem while the NULL: filesystem is not.

Can't we just get rid of NIL handler? Would that be a compatibility issue?
If there are existing AROS specific programs that expect (possible accidentally) &quot;full&quot; NIL handler (or NIL listed in DosList as DLT_DEVICE). Actually this is non-issue, real NIL: handler can be started from Dosboot manually (overriding pseudo NIL) easily if needed. 

DOS packet conversion is advancing nicely, UAE FS boots now (and is faster for some reason). Until Open(CON:) is called. Next problem: console handler, it is quite difficult to test disk based commands without seeing anything on screen.. It does not appear to be as simple conversion as NIL handler (I converted it before I noticed it can't be used..) Do we have some older real dos packet based version hidden somewhere? Nope, the very first checkin (in 1998) of console.handler used the FSA_* API.

Why does this problem not occur with Amiga compilers? Just luck, or do they automatically align functions to 4 bytes? If the latter, maybe the same should be done in our 68k cross-compiler. 

That is horribly bad code that only works accidentally.. There is nothing in documentation that says input handlers have extra scratch registers. Do we need to save D2 and D3 only or do other programs modify
(illegally) other non-scratch registers too? Equally horrible was Titanics Cruncher decruncher that calls dos functions using A5 as a base register, A6 pointed to something else than dosbase, it only worked (accidentally again) because dos packets can be sent without dosbase... i think all registers need save, but maybe its possible to add a GCC compiler command that after the call of eventhandler, all registers are invalid, so later the code use no registers. 

but when you look in software interrupts, docu here stand &quot;dont trash a6&quot; and on interrupts stand

&quot;(D0/D1/A0/A1/A5/A6) may be used as scratch registers by an interrupt handler&quot; 

And when there do not stand anything what registers can use in inputhandler, i think code in AOS is
written that all registers can use from inputhandler. Don't assume something like that is allowed. Show us the documentation which confirms your assumption. And since InputHandlers are chained in input.device as struct Interrupt, I assume the same rules as by software interrupts applies. 

IMO the rule is scratch registers are D0-D1/A0-A1, do not touch other registers unless otherwise specified in documentation. Do not just think, modify your test program to confirm it :) (see what registers can be changed without crashing AOS input handler, I am quite there is at least one address register that can't be modified without crashing it). 

or maybe you take a look, why screenswitcher awin do not work on AROS.maybe i am wrong, but to find
out, a version of AROS that save all registers is usefull.all this programs crash aros total.

http://aminet.net/package/util/wb/ScreenSwitch
http://aminet.net/package/util/wb/awin

awin is written from kas1e, maybe he know what can go wrong
maybe commodity handlers have same problems, they do not accept if a register is change.




====CON====

Original reason is for CON: is compiler/autoinit/stdiowin.c which always sets input and output streams as &quot;CON://///AUTO/CLOSE&quot;. Which forces open console window if program does any read or write from Input()/Output().

This is correct. The behavior is copied from libnix. I  suggest  first  to  test on AmigaOS whether reading from this file really  opens  console window. Perhaps only output opens it, and input does not. The window is not opened immediately, but upon first access. 

While  writing  this  i  understood the origin. CreateNewProc() takes care   about   this,   but   when  started  from  Workbench,  process' input/output  are both NIL:. Startup code takes over both of them, and
we end up with Input() not containing any pre-injected data. 

I would suggest to test the following sequence on AmigaOS:

1. Open CON: with these parameters.
2. Try to read something.
3. Try to write something.
4. Try to read again.

If my guess is correct, step (2) will not cause window open, and just return EOF. If so, our console handler needs to be fixed. This didn't happen originally (=wrong behavior) until (I guess) some dos packet related fix was moved to mainline. It's  not  packet-related, it relates to how AmigaOS handles process' arguments. It injects them into Input().

KS3.1:

handle = Open(&quot;CON://///AUTO/CLOSE&quot;, MODE_OLDFILE)
Console window is not yet open
Read(handle,buf,1) = Window opens, waits for input
or
Write(handle,buf,1) = Window opens





===Resources===

There is tiny chicken and egg problem. AOS does this when automounting with 3rd party autoboot rom (UAE
hardfile driver is 3rd party autoboot rom):  FileSystem.resource is added. 

Something adds FFS dostype nodes to FileSystem.resource. This happens before dos initializes. (maybe when FileSystem.resource is initialized or when FFS is initialized, according to Guru Book it initializes before dos). 

Autoboot ROM does its job, checks for partitions,  loads filesystem(s) from RDB if installed and compares versions against filesystems in FileSystem.resource, if no RDB FFS, checks FileSystem.resource, adds
dosnodes etc... Dos initializes and so on...

Issue: AROS non-dospacket AFS.handler requires dos during init. Which means it can't be initialized before dos, so FileSystem.resource nodes can't be added by AFS handler early enough. (I'd be happy to break it
because it is wrong but I guess I am in minority :D) 

But AFS handler version and revision info is needed to populate FileSystem.resource AFS entries properly... (seglist isn't needed because NULL seglist means use rn_FileHandlerSegment which can be set up after dos). 

Also resident list entries need to be added by something else (I have no idea) than AFS.handler (again, dos needed to do it). 

I guess the real problem is that AROS FS detection didn't use FileSystem.resource at all. M68k-amiga needs it because 3rd party boot roms expect it to be there and expect it to contain AFS Dostypes if KS2.0+. 

This remaining problem prevents booting from 3rd party boot rom driver RDB harddrives with FFS partitions without RDB LSEG FFS installed (real Amiga with for example any SCSI adapter or normal UAE hardfile driver) or normal partition hardfiles (UAE only). 

AROS ata.driver works because it knows how to handle it, so does UAE directory harddrive because it is a filesystem, not a device driver. 

Yes but note that AOS does not even have seglist field in FFS nodes (seglist bit in &quot;patchflags&quot; not set and seglist pointer is outside of allocated memory, they saved 4 bytes of RAM per node!), handler startup code uses rn_FileHandlerSegment in RootNode if seglist is null. 

That would seem to imply that:

* FileSystem.resource initializes
* afs.handler inititializes by registering itself with FileSystem.resource
* dos.library initializes, looks up the 'afs.handler' entry in FileSystem, and sets rn_FileHandlerSegment to the entry's fse_SegList 

If AROS's AFS Handler didn't need DOS during init, we'd be fine. Yeah, as long as it works with higher resident priority than dos. If so, that may be the best way to go. All the AFS handler would do (during init) would be to register itself (version and Handler LSEG) with FileSystem.resource? Yes but note that AOS does not even have seglist field in FFS nodes (seglist bit in &quot;patchflags&quot; not set and seglist pointer is outside of allocated memory, they saved 4 bytes of RAM per node!), handler startup code uses rn_FileHandlerSegment in RootNode if seglist is null.



Can we get rid of AROS_STACK_GROWS_DOWNWARDS?
It seems to needlessly complicate a few things, and it does not seem to be consistently used throughout AROS. 
Do we actually support a 'stack grows up' architecture? Can anyone even think of one that isn't from before the 1980s? 

It was for PA RISC was I believe (I might be wrong), and that was still moderately common in the mid-90's when this code was written. (I recall at the time it was the damn near the fastest CPU). 

That said, I think for practical reasons getting rid of it makes sense. I would expect AROS to run on a CPU with register windows before it ever runs on an grows the other way stack.</text>

==Introduction==



==Hardware Support==


Phase 1: support programs that have custom bootblock, possibly loads few more tracks using trackdisk.device and then the rest uses hardware banging loader. 

Phase 2: support programs that boot to CLI, using startup-sequence. 

cia.resource (rom/cia) seems to be some kind of special case (comment in mmakefile.src,  it includes both ciaa and ciab.resources). I can’t get it to compile, not even the original skeleton version.
If I try to compile it, I get “&lt;path&gt;/build/bin/amiga-m68k/gen/rom/cia/include/cia_deflibdefs.h: No such file or directory” error, I guess something expects “normal” library?
The problem is most probably caused because rom/cia uses build_module_simple to hack both ciaa/ciab into one module. build_archspecific most probably assume build_module was used on generic files (or to put it more clear - that genmodule application was used). 

The solutions are you want to have one physical module cia.resource which will contain both ciaa and ciab -&gt; copy rom/cia into arch/m68k-amiga/cia, change the target name to something like kernel-cia-amiga-m68k and just use that (don't use %build_archspecific at all). May be just fix %build_archspecific instead? It's definitely a flaw.
On weekdays i'll take a look if noone solves this. Should not be that difficult.  Perhaps  %build_module_simple  just  lacks ability to work with %build_archspecific. I remember i fixed this for %build_prog.
But how do I add it to kernel-link-amiga-m68k final rom image? try make kernel-cia-amiga-m68k-kobj -&gt; there is an automagic something-kobj target created by %build_module_simple macro

btw, addicrvector.c misses AbleICR(resource, 0x80 | (1 &lt;&lt; iCRBit));  after successfully adding new interrupt.

Now that cia resource exists, I tried to create keyboard hidd. I took PC keyboard hidd driver, removed all PC specific code, added Amiga keyboard handling (CIA interrupt + handshake). add uselibs=&quot;rom&quot; in your %build_module_simple invocation (check for example arch/i386-pc/drivers/keyboard/mmakefile.src) (other libs that you will probably need are: oop amiga ). Thanks again.&quot;rom&quot; fixed it. &quot;oop&quot; was already included. (I actually used
i386-pc keyboard driver as a base, it didn't have &quot;rom&quot;). Now it appears in resident list during init but kbd.hidd does not seem to be initialized. I must be missing something simple, again..
Your keyboard hidd class needs to explicitly register itself in main keyboard class during module start (at least that's how it looks in pc-i386, see i386-pc/drivers/keyboard/startup.c). However to do this, the main keyboard class must be already up and running and from your log it seems that your kdb.hidd initializes before keyboard.hidd.
BTW, in pc-i386 the keyboard class has quite low priority (10) so it initilizes even after intuition.library - this means the crash you are getting in input.device might not be triggered by missing keyboard class. Exactly. Just decrease its priority by 1/10. Keyboard hidd loads now (was as simple as too high priority..) It is possible to work without input HIDDs at all, you just won't get events and that's all. EFIKA works this way (it has no PS/2 hardware). I also implemented dummy amigamouse.hidd (does nothing yet). input.device does not call alert() anymore.

&quot;card.resource&quot; from KickStart 3.0 wants to call Exec #136 (right after TaggedOpenLibrary, #135) but there is no AROS implementation. Or any doc anywhere that mentions it. In the 3.9 SDK it is listed as 'ExecReserved12'. The name of the function is ReadGayle(). It returns the ID of the Gayle chip if it is on board, or zero if there is no such chip.It first checks whether the normal custom chips are also mirrored at DE1000, if so, no gayle is present. Then, it writes a zero into the gayle ID register (the address above), and then performs eight consecutive reads from the same address. Bit 7 of each read contributes one bit to the overall ID. Placing bit 7 of the first read into bit 7, bit 7 of the second read into bit 6 etc... gives the full ID of the gayle chip. If the result is 0xff, there is no chip at this address and the function returns zero. Otherwise, it returns the read data. Clearly, card.resource requires the gayle ID to know whether the interface to the pcmcia port is available - and this is controlled by gayle. Just make empty function returning 0, and override it in amiga port. 

The mouse cursor has hardware cursor support via the Get method of your driver class you need to return this (one of them is enough)

&lt;pre&gt;
        case aoHidd_Gfx_SupportsHWCursor:
            *msg-&gt;storage = (IPTR)TRUE;
            return;
        case aoHidd_Gfx_HWSpriteTypes:
            *msg-&gt;storage = vHidd_SpriteType_DirectColor;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The you need to implement following methods:

&lt;pre&gt;
SetCursorShape
SetCursorPos
SetCursorVisible
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you need an example, please check nouveau driver: AROS/workbench/hidd/hidd.nouveau


Did you check that bitplane and copper dma gets enabled and copper list looks sane? (O-command in UAE debugger)

I now have quite interesting behavior, software failure and reset if I run it normally in WinUAE (with fastest possible mode). It runs fine if I enable debugger &quot;trace&quot; mode (any breakpoint active and it starts collecting trace data that can be viewed with H and HH commands) 

Debugger in fastest possible mode probably delays interrupt detection by one CPU instruction. Cycle-exact mode works fine too. You can disable automatic reboot after unexpected exception (start.c/Exec_FatalException)? It makes debugging annoying (I replace it with infinite loop) 


The gallium maintainer look over this? I don't know if we can safely use Disable()/Enable() in gallium.
This will most likely kill or seriously hamper the performance. I assume gallium causes problems for m68k. You can do two things: 

a) disable build of libgalliumauxiliary, gallium.library, mesa.library, gallium.hidd and softpipe.hidd for m68k arch (using your own workbench-libs and workbench-hidds targets for example)

b) ifdef your patch so that it is only applied on m68k architecture (so it would be PIPE_ATOMIC_OS_AROS_M68K), while other archs continue using the default approach (GCC instricts)



You can also try getting exec in real autoconfig fast ram (after ConfigChain() call) if you still have too much free time :) Are you talking about moving the &quot;Boot Task&quot; stack, or moving all of Exec out of ROM and into RAM? 

If the former, it *should* happen automatically during the CreateProcess() of the first CLI program. I just need
to fix up the memory allocation pointers to that the 'old' Boot Task stask is properly deallocated  on RemTask(NULL) 





===Gfx===

How do I set correct native mode IDs to mode tag list? (hires,lace,pal,ntsc, etc.). See DDRV_MonitorID tag of AddDisplayDriverA(). Then   you'll   perhaps   need   to  subclass  ModeID  processing  of graphics.hidd because you'll get another structure of ModeIDs. I  suggest  that you'll have one sync per monitor mode (i mean PAL is one sync, NTSC is another one, Multiscan is the third one, etc.). There will be only one pixelformat, other bits in ModeID will be sync modifiers. 

 zzzz xx yy

zzzz  is  actually driver number. They are assigned in turn, starting from  0x0010.  This  way  numbers  up to 0x000F are reserved. I did in especially for Amiga driver.

xx  and  yy  are sync number and pixelformat number. I don't remember right now what is what, but it's not important in fact. 

So  zzzz  is  handled  by  graphics.library  and  xx  yy  handled  by graphics.hidd.

Amiga chipset driver needs to occupy reserved region (0x0000 - 0x000A if  i remember correctly). It is possible to explicitly request driver number using DDRV_MonitorID tag. Now  you  need  to turn zzzz into zzzW, where W is also mode-specific thing.    If    you    look    at   AddDisplayDriverA()   you'll   see AROS_MONITOR_ID_MASK  hardcoded value. One of variants is to implement DDRV_IDMask tag which will allow to override mask value. 

Okay, this is done. Now let's deal with xx and yy.

You'll  likely  have  to  override ModeID routines in your driver. To tell the truth i didn't look at this part at all, so i can't tell you if it would be efficient  to  incorporate  this  functionality  into base class using additional attributes. 

Now about alternative possible approach... 

If  you  examine  graphics.library  code,  you'll see a memory driver instance.  Currently  it's an instance of &quot;hidd.graphics.graphics&quot;, it represents  nondisplayable  bitmap stored in RAM. All temporary planar bitmap objects are owned by this driver. 

Perhaps it will be very efficient to instantiate chipset driver here. Since  chipset  driver  is  still a subclass of graphics.hidd, it will still  support  chunky  bitmaps  in  RAM.  But  it  will  add  missing functionality to planar bitmap. 

The  second point in this variant: since graphics.library knows about this particular driver, it can add its modes in a specific way and you won't  need  to  introduce  new tags to AddDisplayDriverA(). In fact i haven't implemented  this tag already because it's too easy to screw up the whole GFX system by improper use of it, and it is not needed by anyone except chipset driver. 

I believe each of them has its pros and its cons. It's up to you to decide what to actually do with it. Perhaps you'll invent your own way. Anyway I believe you'll have to extend GFX subsystem somehow. I noticed graphics internally here and there checks that aros modeid parts are valid (xx and yy parts must be less than total syncs and pixelformats) This will get messy... 

&lt;pre&gt;
{ aHidd_PixFmt_ColorModel   , vHidd_ColorModel_Palette },
// is following maximum or do I need to have multiple pixformat/depth pairs?
{ aHidd_PixFmt_Depth , 4 },
What does following tags mean in planar mode? (they need to be included or
pixformat gets rejected)
They don't make much sense if bitmap is planar.
{ aHidd_PixFmt_BytesPerPixel, 1 },
{ aHidd_PixFmt_BitsPerPixel , 1 },
{ aHidd_PixFmt_StdPixFmt, vHidd_StdPixFmt_Native },
{ aHidd_PixFmt_BitMapType, vHidd_BitMapType_Planar },
&lt;/pre&gt;

They  mean  what  they  mean.  Of  course BytesPerPixel carries dummy value. StdPixFmt in fact will always be vHidd_StdPixFmt_Plane. 

For some reason boot menu crashes somewhere inside intuition.library OpenScreen(). 
It seems to happen deep inside intuition_mis.c, DoMethodA() call.. (jsr to non-existing address) 

&lt;pre&gt;
     D(bug(&quot;[intuition] RenderScreenBar: ScrDecorObj @ %p, DecorUserBuffer @
%p\n&quot;, ((struct IntScreen *)(scr))-&gt;ScrDecorObj, ((struct IntScreen
*)(scr))-&gt;DecorUserBuffer));
     DoMethodA(((struct IntScreen *)(scr))-&gt;ScrDecorObj, (Msg)&amp;msg); }

D(bug(&quot;[intuition] RenderScreenBar: Update gadgets .. \n&quot;));
&lt;/pre&gt;

gfx hidd update committed, now it looks much much better.
* 24-bit AGA colors supported (if AGA detected)
* display size hardware values are not hardcoded anymore
* use interlace mode  (default screen size is 640x480+, more correct aspect ratio)

but 

* no shres/hires/lores and lace/non-lace automatic selection.
* software blitting only (=slow)

A chunky based driver (chunky shadow bitmap in RAM with chunkytoplanar to real bitmap in CHIPRAM) would be faster, except on the slowest real Amigas like A500. chip ram is '''slow'''. blitter is '''slow'''. 

IIRC some game's c2p routines on 040 or higher could do the conversion at copy speed (chipram write bandwidth). 

Since nothing in AROS or graphics.library relies on direct bitmap access you could  even have a truecolor mode (driver uses real ARGB32 or similar chunky buffer as shadow bitmap) which is realtime dithered to 256 or 16 (or whatever) colors while doing the c2p. For everything outside the driver it is a real truecolor mode. Though, using planar custom chipset graphics as a dummy chunky C2P framebuffer is not Amiga-like enough for me and will be too slow on any real Amiga). 

How do I get this monitor installed? monitorclass.c says you shouldn't touch it. I didn't find anything interesting in existing PC hidds either. Nothing  odd. Basically monitorclass allows to handle multi-display input. Additionally it deals with mouse sprite, because graphics.library functions do not fit very well for multi-monitor environment.
Other stuff is just a reimplementation of MorphOS API (to be compatible with something). So, if there's no monitorclass object, Intuition does not know about your monitor (while graphics still does), and can't handle input on it. Number of planes increased to 5 (if AGA) because default sprite colors (17-19) are not updated if display has less planes. How to handle this correctly? (Does cursor bitmap have a palette?). OpenScreen()  should  take  care  about it. Noone ever tested it with Amiga hardware, so check it. IIRC i commented mouse sprite part well. 

Some private dependencies were removed, and changed monitorclass  object  lookup  in intuition. Since they know monitor ID
and mask, it's possible to find the descriptor by ModeID. 
* First question: why do they have such a wide mask (0xF00000000) ? I supposed chipset driver to have 0xFFF00000.
* And why do you use custom IDs for UAE driver? In fact, i guess this is the reason. Perhaps both drivers happen to have the same monitor ID (ModeID  part  where  mask  has  1's). So FindMonitor() function in intuition  finds a wrong monitor object, and intuition's input handler fails to look up the correct screen. 

When designing the ID assignment scheme, different drivers get different IDs. Automatic assignment is tested very well, but never supposed to have so wide masks. This is why RTG IDs start with 0x00100000.  In chipset  modes  five rightmost digits vary, and 6-8th digits are always 0, this is what reservation is based on. It was never supposed to have 0xF0000000 masks. 


I added this to openscreen.c and now colors 17 to 19 gets allocated by intuition but SetColors bitmap method does get any &gt;15 palette entries. 

&lt;pre&gt;
#if (AROS_FLAVOUR &amp; AROS_FLAVOUR_BINCOMPAT)
        spritebase = 16;
#else
        spritebase = (ns.Depth &lt; 5) ? (1 &lt;&lt; ns.Depth) - 8 : 16;
#endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

Everything you said has been done. That was the easy part. (It was very well documented and for example vesa.hidd does the same as expected) Problem is something internal to graphics or intuition. 

 intuition/misc.c: this calls HIDD SetCursorPos() normally.

&lt;pre&gt;
static void SetPointerPos(struct MonitorData *data, struct IntuitionBase
*IntuitionBase)
{
    ULONG x = data-&gt;mouseX;
    ULONG y = data-&gt;mouseY;

    DB2(bug(&quot;[monitorclass] SetPointerPos(%d, %d), pointer 0x%p\n&quot;, x, y,
data-&gt;pointer));
    if (data-&gt;pointer)
    {
        /* Take HotSpot into account */
    x += data-&gt;pointer-&gt;xoffset;
        y += data-&gt;pointer-&gt;yoffset;

    /* Update sprite position, just for backwards compatibility */
    data-&gt;pointer-&gt;sprite-&gt;es_SimpleSprite.x = x;
    data-&gt;pointer-&gt;sprite-&gt;es_SimpleSprite.y = y;
    }

    DB2(bug(&quot;[monitorclass] Physical coordinates: (%d, %d)\n&quot;, x, y));
    HIDD_Gfx_SetCursorPos(data-&gt;handle-&gt;gfxhidd, x, y);
}

void MonitorClass__MM_SetPointerPos(Class *cl, Object *obj, struct
msSetPointerPos *msg)
{
    struct MonitorData *data = INST_DATA(cl, obj);

    data-&gt;mouseX = msg-&gt;x;
    data-&gt;mouseY = msg-&gt;y;
    SetPointerPos(data, IntuitionBase);
}

Above is called from intuition/misc.c:

void MySetPointerPos(struct IntuitionBase *IntuitionBase)
{
    Object *mon = GetPrivIBase(IntuitionBase)-&gt;ActiveMonitor;

    if (mon)
    DoMethod(mon, MM_SetPointerPos, IntuitionBase-&gt;MouseX,
IntuitionBase-&gt;MouseY);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

IntuitionBase-&gt;ActiveMonitor is always NULL. 
Same problem with all SetCursorXXX() functions, NULL ActiveMonitor -&gt; do not call any mouse routines. 

If I add &quot;bug(&quot;x=%d y=%d);&quot; in this function (outside of if (mon)), I get debug messages as expected when I move mouse. 

Ok, maybe this will help you: when AddDisplayDriver is called by driver, the graphics.library registers a new driver and also notifies intuition.library that new driver was registered. This way intuition.library can create a new monitor object. To get this notification however, intuition.library must first register with graphics.library. 

Maybe your initialization sequence looks like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
graphics.library
amiga.hidd
intuition.library
&lt;/pre&gt;

I think in that case intuition might not be notified and might not know that there is a driver loaded.

Every graphics hidd function is implemented in &quot;generic&quot; way in super class using PutPixel/GetPixel from concrete implementation you need to implement all drawing functions in hidd to get rid of &quot;super class&quot; using PutPixel. (I would suggest starting &quot;improvements&quot; with CopyBox and then continuing with PutImage and PutImageAlpha). CopyBox is
not in bitmap class. 

There are two ways that cursor work: 

* emulation on fakehidd
* native mode

As far as I remember for emulation to work, your driver needs to be a frambuffer one (aHidd_Gfx_NoFrameBuffer = FALSE) and you need to implement Show method to call super method. This emulation simply draws the cursor on your screen for you (restor old backuped 64x64 tile, backup new 64x64 tile, draw cursor) 

For native mode, you need to implement SetCursorVisible, SetCursorPos and SetCursorShape and do the &quot;drawing&quot; yourself in SetCursorPos. You need to mark your driver as NoFrameBuffer = TRUE as well as tell system that you support hw cursor aHidd_Gfx_SupportsHWCursor = TRUE. Also in show method, you must return the received bitmap and do not call super method. Never touch anything above the gfx driver (the hidd class) to get cursor working correctly.

Picasso96 supports following high color modes:

&lt;pre&gt;
RGBFB_R5G6B5PC,        /* HiColor16 (5 bit R, 6 bit G, 5 bit B), format: gggbbbbbrrrrrggg */
RGBFB_R5G5B5PC,        /* HiColor15 (5 bit each),                format: gggbbbbb0rrrrrgg */
RGBFB_R5G6B5,          /* HiColor16 (5 bit R, 6 bit G, 5 bit B), format: rrrrrggggggbbbbb */
RGBFB_R5G5B5,          /* HiColor15 (5 bit each),                format: 0rrrrrgggggbbbbb */
RGBFB_B5G6R5PC,        /* HiColor16 (5 bit R, 6 bit G, 5 bit B), format: gggrrrrrbbbbbggg */
RGBFB_B5G5R5PC,        /* HiColor15 (5 bit each),                format: gggrrrrr0bbbbbbgg */
&lt;/pre&gt;

UAE default is RGBFB_R5G6B5PC (no need for conversions, matches normal little ending 16 bit mode) and I think most UAE ports don't even support other high color modes. 

Is it possible to define this mode for big endian CPU? (like 68k) I don't see how single color component shift and mask can work. I know this isn't required, 8-bit and 32-bit is more than enough but I want to have complete implementation :)

I also have another question:  BitMap_GetImage and PutImage (+LUT variants), what is format of &quot;pixels&quot; array? Always same as bitmap or always 32-bit or 8-bit?
I didn't find good enough examples or documentation. These are last remaining non-implemented methods.
The format of incoming/requested pixel buffer is available in message: msg-&gt;pixFmt.

There are two pseudo formats you can get: Native and Native32. As far as I understood the gfx system Native means &quot;same as bitmap object o which the method is called&quot; and Native32 means &quot;same as bitmap object on which the method is called but packed in 4 byte &quot;pixels&quot;.

If we have 8-bit (256 color) bitmap and Native32 is requested, how to fill the pixels array? (1 byte of data + 3 zeros? 3 zeros + 1 byte? some color conversion?). There are already methods in base class which you can use:

&lt;pre&gt;
GetMem32Image8
ConvertPixels
PutMem32Image8
&lt;/pre&gt;

Check /workbench/hidds/hidd.nouveau/nouveau_accel.c

&lt;pre&gt;
HiddNouveauWriteFromRAM
HiddNouveauReadIntoRAM
&lt;/pre&gt;

The cascade of switch/case you will see in these functions is common to every driver's GetImage/PutImage I think.
Let's take for example GetImage method. It's called on a bitmap object requesting to have a specified box (msg-&gt;x, msg-&gt;y, msg-&gt;width, msg-&gt;height) from this bitmap object to be transferred into memory buffer (msg-&gt;pixels) which has a given stride (msg-&gt;modulo) and a given pixel format (msg-&gt;pixFmt). To do this, you first check the given(requested) pixel format if it is Native, Native32 or something else. In first two cases you then check the input bytesperpixel value and based on this you decide which of the existing CopyMemBoxXXX or GetMemXXXImageYYY methods to use. If the requested format is different thatn Native or Native32, you need to use the ConvertPixels method which will do the conversion for you. Implementing your driver you don't have to worry how the memory is organized in formats during conversion because this is already implemented in CopyMemBox/GetMemImage/ConvertPixels methods.

Please note that generic conversion methods used in ConvertPixels are somewhat slow. There are more specific methods which are faster. You can switch to those methods by running tests/patchrgbconv. You can also do like I do in nouveau and patch those methods in the driver itself so that users don't have to worry about this. 

Since we are talking about patches I understand that you don't want to write drivers for 3rd party Amiga hardware but do you think there would be any solution to use Picasso96 drivers on AROS m68k? I'm not asking you to do it, just want to know if installing Picasso96 on top would work or if the code you wrote allows using .chip/.card files so RTG can be used on real Amigas. I understand that original drivers of Deneb, scsi, and others should work OOTB in AROS m68k. Uaegfx hidd uses .card API internally to communicate with UAE side. It should be quite easy to modify it for &quot;real&quot; Picasso96 drivers and cards. (I could do this, I do have an A3000 but no expansion cards. Never really cared about display cards..)  Most drivers should work fine. 

But what about 040/060 accelerators, how are these cpus handled? would it cause incompatibilities with some accelerators?  Not supported yet (only partial detection done so far) 

Maybe I missed something important but it seems gfx hidds need to specify every supported depth value.
For example if you want to fully support AGA, hidd should have 8 different pixelformats (and OCS/ECS 4 or 5 depending on horizontal resolution). Shouldn't it automatically generate all lower depth pixelformats? 

This really slows down graphics on real Amigas, especially on non-AGA machines because now it always forces 4 planes hires which eats all chip ram bandwidth and takes too much memory. 

Another big compatibility problem is wrong modeIDs. This needs working solution. 
I also would like to have solution to modeid issue, I don't really see the point of dynamically generated modeids by some outside entity. The  main  point  is:  the  same driver can be instantiated more than once. For example you can have two similar graphics card, each of them can have more than one output. This way in case of two Radeon cards you  would have four instances of the same driver. What mode IDs would you assign? And how?  In  CyberGraphX you create mode IDs manually using preferences program. I decided that it's not comfortable and implemented dynamic generation of monitor IDs (most significant word of mode ID). The rest (pixelformat  and sync numbers) in fact left from the old implementation. I invented nothing new there. Perhaps it still has some drawbacks, however I believe it's acceptable. Anyway the programmer doesn't have to assign IDs manually. 

I added more modes to RTG driver and suddenly all other modes got new IDs... Also apparently at least some m68k RTG programs decide that too &quot;small&quot; modeid numbers = native planar modes..  What is &quot;too small&quot; ?

Now about what you want to know... When i implemented the new ID scheme, i actually left space for Amiga
IDs (read: for you). For  the  clearance: display mode ID is divided into two halves: most significant half is &quot;monitor ID&quot; and least significant one is raw mode ID  itself  (sync + pixelformat). The HIDD knows only about  the latter half, monitor ID is maintained by graphics.library. 

If  you  look  at  the  code  carefully, you'll see that ID numbering starts from 0x0010. No RTG drivers are added with IDs less than this one. Your  driver  needs  to  occupy  this reserved space. Additionally it needs  to  specify 0xFFF00000 mask for its modes, since Amiga mode IDs can be represented as 0x000X XXXX. 

Currently  AddDisplayDriverA()  lacks  a possibility to specify mask. However you can specify starting ID (using DDRV_MonitorID tag). There are the following possible solutions: 

* a Implement DDRV_IDMask tag.
* b Implement  a  single boolean tag like DDRV_AmigaModes, which will automatically assign Amiga modes to the driver.
* c Make  graphics.library  on  m68k  to  explicitly instantiate chipset driver instead of dummy memory driver as its default driver.

I don't like (a) because improper use of this tag can easily screw up graphics.library.  I  would  consider only (b) or (c) options. Perhaps (c)  is  even  better  because  it would automatically make all planar 
bitmaps  belonging  to  the chipset driver. It's actually up to you to decide what to do and implement it.
But  please don't break the whole ID scheme. I thought a lot on it. I asked  others  before  implementing  it,  but  noone came up with some alternative. 

modeID is generated by &quot;someone else&quot; and any modification to supported modes renumbers the modeIDs. (which is especially problem under emulation because user  can select which bit depths are enabled or if you want BGR or RGB etc..). 

what concerns rtg and non rtg modes (i think its modeid hes talking about):

&lt;pre&gt;
everything below monitor-id $00100000 is an amigamode 
all other ids are standing for rtg 
if you found anything over $00100000 use the cgfx-functions to identify the gfxcard
p96 supports the functions of cgfx 
&lt;/pre&gt;

myself, i thought cgx supplies static modeids, but on p96 the first four digits that define resolution are dependant on in which order the modes have been declared, so they are semi-random, the last that describe depth/bit order are hardwired to mode they represent. Here are p96 modeid last four digits values that represent particular bit orders on each physical resolution, ive been able to find out on my voodoo3 system. 

&lt;pre&gt;
xxxx1000 = 8bit
xxxx1100 = 16bit pc
xxxx1102 = 16 bit
xxxx1201 = 24bit
xxxx1300 = 32bit argb
xxxx1303 = 32bit bgra
&lt;/pre&gt;

0x8000100e which is DIPF_IS_HAM | DIPF_IS_PF2PRI | DIPF_IS_DUALPF | DIPF_IS_EXTRAHALFBRITE (+ bit 31 set which apparently is a game bug..) 

Unfortunately this means AOS original ModeIDs need to be emulated someway, even when using RTG display (all native chipset special bits needs to be zeroed in this situation) 


How to add &quot;standard&quot; monitor ModeIDs that aros graphics system can promote to standard hidd modes?
(Just like real m68k-amiga RTG hardware does when mode promotion is enabled). See updated  AddDisplayDriverA() documentation. I added DDRV_ID_Mask tag for this. &quot;Note that for this feature to work correctly, you also need to override mode ID processing in your driver class. Default methods provided by
hidd.graphics.graphics base class suppose that the whole lower word of mode ID specifies the display mode.&quot;

What exactly does overriding mode ID processing means? Overload methods like GetMode, GetSync, NextMode, etc.


For example PowerPacker does this:
* calls QueryOverscan(0x29000,&amp;rect, OSCAN_TEXT); which fails. 
* PP ignores return code, rect contains random memory contents. 
* copies garbage rect contents to NewScreen structure screen position and size.
* adds some OpenScreenTags() tags, including modeid tag = 0x29000 
* of course screen fails to open (non-existing mode id, totally bogus screen width and height) 

 0x29000 = PAL_MONITOR_ID | HIRES_KEY.

At least PAL_MONITOR_ID, NTSC_MONITOR_ID, HIRES_KEY and LORES_KEY combinations should be always supported and return matching resolution. There   is   some   promotion   code  in OpenScreen() (left over from
MorphOS), check it and fix if needed (see openscreen.c, line 597). 
I guess this is easy and simple, mark one driver as &quot;preferred&quot; (can drivers have priorities?). They can. However currently they don't. 

If &quot;other&quot; driver modeid is asked, just find similar enough mode from preferred driver mode list? 
Currently BestModeIDA() looks through all drivers,   perhaps  we  should  really  have  some  &quot;default&quot;  driver, user-specified. We  should  develop  then some concept for user preferences regarding monitors. This can include specifying preferred monitor, advanced mode promotion, describing placement of monitors, etc. 

Apparently you need to define pixel format for all plane counts instead of just one that describes max supported plane count. Which means for example there needs to be 8 different modeIDs for single AGA
resolution. (320x256x1, 320x256x2,... 320x256x8 and same for all other resolutions) 

It is quite difficult to fit 8 modeIDs (or 4/5 on OCS/ECS) in single official documented modeid bit.
maybe its possible to add to the AROS code that the automatic ID generation create only ID above 0x10000000 ? and all below can create thru manual ID. If only 320x256x8 is defined, all lower plane mode requests are always &quot;promoted&quot; to 8 planes. 


One more issue that needs to be fixed before native modes can work. aoHidd_BitMap_Depth is needed (which is for some reason commented out and not handled everywhere, like in AllocBitmap()). AllocBitMap() sends width, height, pixelformat to HIDD but not depth. Which is really needed to support m68k-amiga chipset modes. It needs one pixelformat/modeid per resolution, not one pixelformat per (resolution * available depths). If you look at line 392 in allocbitmap.c you will see that the depth is actually copied from pixel format (* or from bitmap object - this part I don't understand).
According to my understanding its driver's role to correctly handle the situation:
 AllocBitmap(depth=1 bit, friend bitmap depth=2)
It should allocate a bitmap with depth of 2 ignoring the passed depth completely. This code is in root GraphicsClass (line 1177). 
I put it in allocbitmap because modeid is also copied from friend bitmap there (not in the driver)
Because technically chunky modeid includes the depth too. 
I also compared your bitmap New method with my nouveau New method and I noticed that you use: 
 OOP_GetAttr(o, aHidd_BitMap_Depth, &amp;depth);
while I use
&lt;pre&gt;
 OOP_GetAttr(o, aHidd_BitMap_PixFmt, (APTR)&amp;pf);
 OOP_GetAttr(pf, aHidd_PixFmt_Depth, &amp;depth);
&lt;/pre&gt;
This means you are taking depth that was passed (see root BitMap class New method) while I'm taking depth taken from pixel format from friend bitmap. Is this because of difference in handling planar and chunky modes? Yes. Planar mode's depth is separate from pixelformat (modeid). Planar mode's pixfmt_depth =pixelformat's max supported depth (different on OCS/ECS and AGA). 

Any non-driver code that assumes pixfmt_depth = bitmap's current depth can't work correctly with planar modes. I complained about this AOS incompatible design issue few times in this ML until I re-added commented out aHidd_BitMap_Depth and more, did you miss it? :) 




Do I do something wrong or is this missing gfx hidd feature?
btw, afaik at least bitplane mask field in rastport should be passed to hidd rectfill() and friends if we are going to handle all low bitplane tricks, in worst case minterm array is needed (which would replace drawmode and mask in complex situations) if dpaint screen mode requester is supposed to work correctly. 


HIDD_BM_ConvertPixels() - it doesn't seem to fully convert from chunky to planar. ie  vHidd_StdPixFmt_ARGB32 -&gt; vHidd_StdPixFmt_Plane does the LUT transformation, but not repacking the pixels into planar mode. Is this the job of HIDD_BM_ConvertPixels(), and if so, are there any
'well known' Chunky-&gt;Planar routines in AROS I could reuse? 

aHidd_PixFmt_BitsPerPixel: Should be the # of bits per pixel, obviously, but appears only to be set, never used. aHidd_PixFmt_BytesPerPixel: What should this be set to for Planar formats? 1? 0? (- Depth)?
aHidd_PixFmt_Depth: This should be the number of planes for Planar. Shouldn't this be 0 for Chunky? 

In  fact this can be an incomplete implementation. Historically   vHidd_StdPixFmt_Plane  referred  only  to  single-plane monochrome  bitmap,  it  was  used  for  rendering fonts. Later it was extended,  and  about  a  year  ago  i  dropped  original font drawing routines. 



Proposing...

Chunky Formats:

  aHidd_PixFmt_Depth == 1
  aHidd_PixFmt_BytesPerPixel == Number of bytes to store a pixel, if

the pixel is byte aligned. 0 for 'packed pixel' (ie 2-color bitmap non-planar)

  aHidd_PixFmt_BitsPerPixel == Number of valid bits per pixel chunk.

If BytesPerPixel == 0, then this indicated that packing of packed pixels

Examples:
* Hercules monochrome: Depth = 1, BytesPerPixel = 0, BitsPerPixel = 1
* CGA 4 color mode: Depth = 1, BytesPerPixel = 0, BitsPerPixel = 2
* VGA 256 color mode: Depth = 1, BytesPerPixel = 1, BitsPerPixel = 8
* RGB 15 bit mode: Depth = 1, BytesPerPixel = 2, BitsPerPixel = 15

Planar Formats follow the same rules, but note that there can be more than one bit per pixel per plane.

  aHidd_PixFmt_Depth = 1..8 (Number of planes)
  aHidd_PixFmt_BytesPerPixel == Number of bytes to store a pixel, if

the pixel is byte aligned 0 for 'packed pixel' (ie 2-color bitmap non-planar)

  aHidd_PixFmt_BitsPerPixel == Number of valid bits per pixel chunk.

If BytesPerPixel == 0, then this indicated that packing of packed pixels

Examples:

* Amiga 4 color mode: Depth = 4, BytesPerPixel = 1, BitsPerPixel = 1
* Amiga 256 color mode: Depth = 8, BytesPerPixel = 1, BitsPerPixel = 1
* Some make up 24+8 bit RGBA, where there are 8 bits of a single color or alpha per plane: Depth = 4, BytesPerPixel = 1, BitsPerPixel = 8

ConvertPixels for planar, and I'm at a bit of a quandry as to what certain fields mean.
Maybe the list is incomplete, but isn't there anything like &quot;BytesPerLine&quot; or &quot;Width including pad&quot;? 
There  is  gettable aHidd_BitMap_BytesPerRow.  There  is  however  no support for padding.  Once  i  needed  this  for  planar  bitmap  and i introduced aHidd_BitMap_Align.  Alignment does not affect BytesPerRow value which is  always  returned  as  Width  *  BytesPerPixel (taken from bitmap's (pixelformat).  This is likely wrong and alignment should be accounted. Also  BytesPerRow  will  be  calculated  wrong for planar bitmaps, the attribute needs to be overloaded in planarbm class. 
The way I see it is that ConvertPixels was never meant for things like planar to chunky conversion. But only for LUT to LUT. Or LUT to TRUECOLOR. OR TRUECOLOR to TRUECOLOR. Where LUT basically implies a chunky pixel layout. And ConvertPixels being there to support functions like WritePixelArray(), WriteLUTPixelArray(), ReadPixelArray(), WriteChunkyPixels(). 

So, if I understand you correctly, GetImage/PutImage for Planar should handle the chunky/planar conversion, and use the current ConvertPixels as a helper, instead of calling the root class's GetImage/PutImage and its usage of ConvertPixels. Currently, PlanarBM is calling the root class for non-native PixFmt types on PutImage. You imply that PlanarBM should be handling the conversion itself for *all* incoming types, correct? 

All the code can stay as it is now and it should not matter how internally the bitmap looks like (or is there something which doesn't work?), because graphics library and hidd stuff don't rely on how it looks like. When code needs to look at bitmap pixels, it is all done using pixel buffers == pixel arrays == chunky arrays and functions like PutImage/GetImage even for planar bitmaps and pixfmt == Native or Native32 will write/read chunky pixel arrays/buffers. (see rom/hidds/graphics/planarbm.c) 

So if one writes a gfx driver with a planar bitmap class then PutImage/GetImage and pixfmt==Native|Native32 is not supposed to use/return planar data, but chunky data. 

Also in theory there is no single planar format. Things like interleaved or not. MSBFirst/LSBFirst (see X11). Atari like planar formats. Implicit alignment is an option, but if the API is legacy-free, indeed it is more convenient to have BytesPerRow and Pad separately. When copying from/to a bitmap, normally the pad is just wasted space. Plus, having it declared separately avoids mistakes in calculation. 

This would also help to distinct planar vs. chunky/true-color formats. 
aHidd_PixFmt_BitsPerPixel: Should be the # of bits per pixel, obviously, but appears only to be set, never used. Really?  It can be used at least for comparison, when registering new pixelformats. Don't  remove  anything  unless you are sure that you studied all the code.   I  remember  i  had  problems  with  changes  there,  it  took significant time to settle all it down. 

aHidd_PixFmt_BytesPerPixel: What should this be set to for Planar formats? 1? 0? (- Depth)? 
I  would say this is undefined for planar bitmaps. Let's set it to 0. Just we need to be sure that it breaks nothing. 

aHidd_PixFmt_Depth: This should be the number of planes for Planar. Shouldn't this be 0 for Chunky?
No, It's used in many places to determine number of colors. I saw it the other way - Depth in struct BitMap was the number of Plane[] array elements that were valid. In Chunky, only the first one was valid, therefore Depth = 1. 


How can I call RTG (=any non-custom chipset driver in this case) Hidd_Gfx__Show(FALSE) when custom chipset driver Hidd_Gfx__Show(TRUE) is called? (and vice versa). There's no such relation. Drivers  are  completely  independent  on  each  other.  You  can use simultaneously both displays, one on chipset and another on GFX board. Problem is that something must tell the RTG driver to become idle and enable chipset mode passthrough when custom chipset mode is selected. This is not emulation specific. 
 
This is needed to switch between custom/RTG modes on emulation (and without switching cables on real Amigas). Well,  you  can  make  AROS  to  unload chipset driver when any other driver is loaded. Set DDRV_BootMode to TRUE when adding it, and you're done. Chipset driver must never be unloaded, it must be always available if user runs program that specifically requires chipset mode (for example old games or whdload or whatever). 

Or maybe we need something more powerful than Show() so that possible non-display ram bitmaps are also freed to keep memory usage lower? Show() displays only one bitmap. Other bitmaps go offscreen.
There's  ShowViewPorts(),  it  takes  a  list  of bitmaps. It's up to driver to track their state.
However  you  can't  free  any  bitmaps,  AROS may use them. Only the creator can free bitmaps. Chipset display is hidden &quot;behind RTG&quot; (not visible) because hardware (emulated or not) thinks RTG is the currently active mode. 

Currently any attempt to open custom chipset mode opens it &quot;behind&quot; RTG mode.
Do  you  mean  some emulation issue? Does emulator attempt to display both modes in the same window?
Well, emulation sucks. In order to overcome this, you can teach the driver to   shutdown   the   emulated  hardware  when  nothing  is  displayed (Show(NULL)  is  called).  This  would  tell UAE to close emulated RTG display.  Windows-hosted  driver does the same thing in order to avoid empty windows - it just closes the display window when there's nothing to show in it. On  real hardware this is not an issue, this is an advantage instead. You  can work with two monitors this way and display different screens on them (thanks to different mode IDs). Problem is lack of Show(NULL). I'll implement it in WinUAE if your real physical monitor disappears when you call Show(NULL). In fact during LoadView() every driver will get Show() if something changes on it. If there was something on display, and it goes away, the driver will get Show(NULL). It still does not have anything to do with my problem. RTG and native are being considered different physical monitors. (at least we will agree on that!) = No one is going to call RTG.Show(NULL) when something opens on native screen (Native.Show(BitMap)). 
I only need to know how to call another driver's (name is known at least) Show() method (indirectly or directly) from other driver's Show() method so both both are never active simultaneously. Cleanly. 
Lets call it blanking the display instead of disabling it or turning it off if we need some kind of stupid analogy :) 

btw, custom chipset driver ModeIDs are now correct (no more generated fake ids)
And what about those real physical RTG cards that have custom chipset passthrough cable and relay or electronic switch? This is what UAE emulates. Not two physical displays. 
In other words: we have single monitor that shares two displays, if topmost screen = RTG screen -&gt; RTG enabled, if topmost screen = chipset screen -&gt; RTG disabled, chipset screen passthrough gets enabled. This is not (fully) supported. It is a hack but that's how it is supposed to work in this situation. I don't care if it is strange or stupid way of design today but Picasso96 was designed to support passthrough automatically via software and some cards (and UAE) support and expect it. 

There can be a problem with &quot;cleanly&quot;. The hacks I can think off are:

a) put both driver codes into one hidd and do a lot of &quot;if (native) else&quot;

b) add some dummy module that will be known by both drivers and will arbitrate:

graphics -&gt; native.hidd (Show) -&gt; module

module checks if rgt.hidd was registers before

if yes:

module-&gt; rtg.hidd(Show(NULL))

then

native.hidd-&gt; module (register as beeing shown)

native.hidd -&gt; continue with Show

However I'm not sure if it is safe to call Show(NULL) from this module

PS. For screen dragging you will have to implement ShowViewPorts anyhow

Too ugly :)

Can't you just enumerate all monitors and send some kind of &quot;Power save&quot;/&quot;blank&quot; signal to all monitors except the one that matches current modeid? (that then internally gets converted to Show(NULL)?)
Or is there some kind of LoadView(MonitorID, NULL) call? Not that I know off - your use case goes kind off against system design. The assumption so far was that every driver instance outputs its &quot;signal&quot; to a separate physical display device and the drivers don't know about each other existance, while in your case two separate drivers need to output to one physical display device, but can never output at a same time. Unless you want to redesign how the gfx drivers system work, you will have to cope with b)-like &quot;approach&quot;  

Couldn't it be implemented in intuition.library/graphics.library that they keep track of displays on the same monitor and on different monitor and send the Show(NULL) when one driver on the same monitor get priority over another one ? This is probably the &quot;correct&quot; solution but I am not going to request
(possibly complex) new core feature that only (?) m68k-amiga (with RTG) needs.




Automatic monitor swithing on amiga hardware is a normal feature and should be properly supported by AROS; not by hacks. 

We have two classes of display devices: Drivers and Monitors. Monitors describe the allowed display mode timings (but not color depth). Drivers are connected to Monitors, and use the Monitor's timing lists
to determine which of their possible modes are valid. Multiple Drivers can be connected to a single Monitor instance, to represent passthru systems. 

Let's imagine a A4000 with a Picasso96 style card, and a separate (ATI Mach64) card on a PCI busboard, and two monitors, a 1084 and a standard VGA: 

&lt;pre&gt;
Driver 1 (P96) \
                ---&gt;  Monitor 1 (Commodore 1084)
Driver 2 (AGA) /

Driver 3 (ATI) ----&gt;  Monitor 2 (VGA)
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this case, we'll want the 'blanking' behavior Toni was talking about for the P96 and AGA. Now, let's suppose someone (me, for instance), write a driver for a Voodoo 1 3D card, which has a VGA passthrough, and puts it in the A4000: 

&lt;pre&gt;
Driver 1 (P96) \
                ---&gt;  Monitor 1 (Commodore 1084)
Driver 2 (AGA) /

Driver 3 (ATI)    \
                   ---&gt;  Monitor 2 (VGA)
Driver 4 (Voodoo) /
&lt;/pre&gt;

In this case also, we want the blanking behavior. The Voodoo case is also valid for i386, by the way. 




No one is going to call RTG.Show(NULL) when something opens on native screen (Native.Show(BitMap)) 

This is wrong. All  drivers  get  something  during  LoadView(). When a driver had a screen  on  it, and this screen is closed, the driver gets Show(NULL). At  least  it  should  be  so. If this doesn't happen, it's a bug. See driver_LoadView() routine. 

Or  are  you  talking about the situation where you have two screens, one on board and on on chipset, and try do depth-arrange them? Hm...  The  system really doesn't support such a case. Looks like the driver needs to know somehow that its screen is behind chipset's one. Exactly. (Or vice versa, it is important to select &quot;monitor&quot; that has current topmost screen). 

It is possible to implement it without hacks. However, to do this, two things must be fulfilled:

1. The driver needs to know ViewPort being shown. 

2. Chipset  driver  needs  to  fill  in  copperlist pointers for its ViewPorts. 

I guess, (2) can be done by adding MakeVPort method to graphics HIDD. (1)... Don't know yet. Perhaps ShowViewPort() is bad. If  these  two conditions are met, RTG driver can check GfxBase-&gt;View and  check if its ViewPort is behind or in front of chipset one. Only chipset ViewPorts will have nonzero copperlist pointers. 




r38178 &quot;Interrupt immediately if the callback returned error&quot; test causes blank screen on m68k-amiga when using UAEGFX because chipset mdd comes first, fn() returns zero which then causes following driver (UAEGFX) to be always skipped. Removing the test allows UAEGFX to work again. (wrong test? success == 0, not error, at least driver_LoadViewPorts() return zero on success). Of course 0 stands for no error, it's a bug. Remove exclamation sign. 



I'd like to select nice 640x480x8 or similar mode for bootmenu and initial WB screen when RTG is available (instead of boring 640x256x2, hires and 4 planes on OCS/ECS is horribly slow). 

Probably too ugly way is to mask monitor id part of modeid and check if it is nonzero.. Unfortunately DPIF_IS flags seem to be useless. 

You can look how IsCyberModeId() is implemented in cgx. OOP_Object *pf = (OOP_Object *)info.reserved[1]; 
Yes, I don't think this is the way to go either.. However  IMHO  this  is not a proper way to go. This does not prevent BestModeID()  from  selecting  chipset  modes.  Something  needs to be invented. 
Does &quot;other&quot; Amiga-like OS's have some kind of DPIF_CHUNKY or similar flags? 
Annoyingly there is DPIF_AA and DPIF_ECS but no DPIF_OCS or similar.. 
I'd like to have quick and clean way to detect modeid type in rom code. (to select &quot;best&quot; boot menu and initial shell modes, early alert?, before the screen is open). 

&lt;pre&gt;
    /*
     * Set the propertyflags,
     * Note that we enforce some flags because we emulate these features by software 
     * DIPF_IS_FOREIGN is actually set only by Picasso96 and only for modes that are 
     * not graphics.library compatible. Many m68k RTG games rely on this flag not being 
     * set.
     */
    di-&gt;PropertyFlags = DIPF_IS_WB | DIPF_IS_SPRITES | DIPF_IS_DBUFFER
| HIDDProps.DisplayInfoFlags;
&lt;/pre&gt;

I think this should be moved to HIDD_Gfx_ModeProperties () so that it can be overridden by custom chipset driver. These  flags are intentionally forced for features that are simulated by graphics.library. 
SPRITES is set because graphics.library can emulate mouse sprite. WB is set... Why not ? 
DBUFFER  is  set because i emulate this. I know, the emulation sucks, and in fact this should be handled in the driver. 

DIPF_IS_WB should not be set in special custom chipset modes. (HAM, etc..). Also it seems DIPF_IS_DBUFFER is not set in native Amiga RTG modes. I haven't 100% confirmed this yet but if it is true, it is guaranteed
some (stupid) software will assume DIPF_IS_DBUFFER set = always chipset mode.. 

* Remove DBUFFER enforcement.
* Add  one  more  field to ModeProperties, like ResetFlags. It will contain  bits  that  need to be RESET in default flag set. If you SET DIPF_IS_WB there, it will be UNSET in the resulting flags set. This  will  provide good backwards compatibility with what is already done.



What  do  you think, what if we sort drivers not by ID number, but by some  priority?  If we assign for example -128 to chipset driver and 0 to  others,  from  two  modes  with equal parameters BestModeID() will
select one with higher priority. However,  if  for example we request 320x256, it won't be promoted to
RTG  if  RTG  drivers only offer 320x200 and 640x480. PAL 320x256 will still be a best match. 
Native Amiga mode promotion is very simple, BestModeID() only returns RTG modes. It never returns chipset modes (at least without using some configuration program). This way OpenScreen() without modeid always gets RTG mode, only way to get mode you want (including chipset modes) is to specify wanted ModeID. 
320x256 will return something larger (maybe 320x400 in worst case). This is still the expected result. 

So plain priorities won't fix this problem completely.
One  possible  option  is  to  add some &quot;don't autoselect me&quot; flag to AddDisplayDriverA(). Another option it to let user to select a preferred monitor in prefs, and  BestModeIDA()  should first try this monitor, and try others only if nothing was found. 

BestModeID() option probably is the best, at least for shared monitor case. 

Mode promotion needs to be configurable anyway so preferred monitor probably is the most native amiga compatible way. Not sure if is fits in AROS design very well.. M68k-amiga currently has overridden BestModeID() (until there is better solution) that simply looks for RTG modes first and only checks chipset modes if RTG mode scan didn't return any results. It seems to work fine. 

I think we have slightly different use cases which should be handled by driver code: 

* Single monitor, single driver. Always works as expected.
* Single monitor, multiple drivers. Here one should be configured as &quot;a primary driver&quot;, BestModeID() only returns modes if it is primary driver mode. 
* Multiple monitors, one driver per monitor.  Priorities needed in this case? Should BestModeID() return mode from any or only from some kind of &quot;preferred monitors&quot;? 
* Multiple monitors, one or more driver(s) per monitor. (Does this exists? Maybe m68k-amiga and 2 RTG cards with only one having passthrough?) Not sure what to do here or if this is worth the trouble.. 

But this would need separation of gfx driver and monitor. Probably this gets too complex.. 




A quick hack to RTG driver that allows RTG/native switching, probably too ugly but at least it seems to work and allows easier testing. I noticed there is strange side-effect when switching between RTG/chipset screens. Enforce mentioned flags only for chunky drivers. For planar ones they will need to be provided by the driver. The philosophy behind: any RTG screen is WB-compatible. But not every planar one. 

Boot to Wanderer (RTG mode), run any program that specifically wants PAL or NTSC custom chipset screen. Mode switches as expected (RTG chipset passthrough activates) but chipset screen's menu bar and mouse cursor
are missing, also input (mouse and keyboard) still goes to Wanderer's window. Automatic  screen  activation  is missing. The input will be switched when some window on the screen gets activated. ActiveScreen stuff in ActivateWindow() but why does this problem only happen when switching between &quot;monitors&quot;? Screen switching works fine if only using RTG or only using chipset screens. Active  window doesn't change. It changes only when you click in another window on frontmost screen. Mouse  sprite  is visible only on active monitor. Active monitor is a monitor on which active screen is displayed. Active monitor is only set when screen is set topmost (shortcut and depth gadget only sets screen to bottom) and OpenScreen() only sets active monitor when there is no monitor set. 
Intuition  tracks  current  active  monitor. When a screen is sent to bottom,  new  active  screen  is not head of the list. It is the first screen which matches current monitor. Active monitor changes in the following cases: 

&lt;pre&gt;
1. Some screen is explicitly set frontmost by some software.
2. There was no active monitor at all (all screens blank). 
3. Hosted   driver   calls   a  special  activation  callback  (see monitorclass source).
4. Mouse  pointer crosses screen borders and spatial linkage for the current monitor is set up in monitorclass. 
&lt;/pre&gt;

(4) is a TODO, it's not implemented yet, but should be.

Do I simply add temporary #ifdefs to always set active monitor when building m68k build? (lack of ActiveMonitor() calls makes development and testing quite annoying so any kind of temporary hack is better
than nothing). If  you  want  to,  you can play with activation callbacks. They will perfectly  work on native drivers. RTG driver needs to call it when it switches  off  the  passthrough.  The only bottleneck - chipset driver needs  to  call it when RTG driver releases the passthrough. They need to talk somehow.
Alternative:  add  monitorclass  attributes to describe drivers which share  the same display (kind of z-order linkage, analogous to current spatial linkage). And make Intuition tracking this. 

Same happens if I switch screens by pressing Amiga+N/M or clicking Wanderer's screen depth gadget.

The whole getdisplayinfodata.c should be extended to support custom chipset special features (most important being overscan and sprite resolution not same as display resolution). Many things are still missing. This is  why we added size to ModeProperties structure. It can be extended. 

A HUGE amount of FindName(&quot;hidd.graphics.gc&quot;) calls during any graphics operation (text output, scrolling, dialog) etc.. This is due to the way the OOP stubs work. In non-ROMmable libraries, (AROS_CREATE_ROM undefined) they cache the result of that lookup in the .bss. In ROMmable libs, without a .bss. Really need to find a way to get this to work for ROMmable libraries without all that overhead. 



Implemented an API for MakeVPort() and MrgCop(). 
* MrgCop()  calls  PrepareViewPorts after building ViewPortData chains. The  method also gets View pointer. You can do any preparations there. 
* ShowViewPort's job is just to commit calculated changes.
Since  you  get View, you can detect position of your ViewPortData in it.
You can also manage AmigaOS copperlist pointers in these methods. 
Could fakegfxhidd (software mouse cursor) support ShowViewPorts() too? No need for composition/multiple ViewPorts, only need to get View information. 

Because fakegfxhidd only supports Show(), there is no way to (at least without really ugly hacks) to handle RTG/chipset passthrough and most UAE versions don't have Picasso96 (UAEGFX) hardware mouse cursor emulation. (afaik it is not ported from WinUAE and WinUAE only supports it in Direct3D mode which isn't meant to be compatible with too old PCs). 

Maybe I can add software cursor emulation to uaegfx driver but I am not sure it is worth the trouble. (or is it the right way to do it?)




Today i made planarbm faster and better Now it just carries struct BitMap inside. No more planes array etc copying and you can retrieve a pointer to it at any time for direct modification and now i'm working on software composition layer. Want to generalize it. 
It will be a separate module sitting in DEVS:Monitors. It will hotplug into graphics.library. You can update Amiga display driver to support it. Instead of calling GetBitMap (which copies the structure), just get aHidd_PlanarBM_BitMap attribute. 
This is similar to aHidd_ChunkyBM_Buffer. It's initable and setable, so you can wrap own bitmaps into objects. 
And also i invented a framework for mirrored display driver (like VESA and VGA). 
Base class will support everything by itself. You'll just need to supply a single framebuffer bitmap to it. It will do mirroring by
itself, eliminating code duplication. 

This happens when amiga driver is asked to create new bitmap, I don't see how it can have anything to do with GetBitMap/SetBitMap and friends. (at least not this problem). AmigaVideoBM__Root__New() is called which then immediately calls OOP_DoSuperMethod -&gt; BM_New  -&gt; PBM_New -&gt; failure. 

Amiga driver isn't very clean and it still is too slow for anything useful. For example PutImage() needs assembly C2P and GetImage() P2C routines, currently they are slow^10. 

Adding RTG driver support but chipset is too slow for software composition. Normal full hardware screen dragging will be done someday (currently only front most screen is visible when dragging). 



Why do many graphics routines use LONG coordinates? Is it possible to replace them with WORDs or platform specific 16/32-bit typedef? This causes unnecessary slowdown on 68000-compatible build because it can force use of much slower 32bit multiplications (32x32=32) and divisions (32/32=32) which are not directly supported by 68000/010.
(68000/010 only have 16x16=32 multiplication and 32/16=16:16 division instruction), also all LONG operations are always slower than WORD on those CPUs (68000/010 ALU is 16-bit). 

All graphics routines :) (including hidds/graphics/BM_Class.c for example)
Graphics.library function parameter documentation  does not make much sense.. 
clib/protos lists most functions as taking LONGs (even Move and Draw that use RastPort WORD field to store last position!) Autodocs lists most functions as taking WORDs. 

Internally AOS graphics.library seem to always use WORDs (ignoring high 16 bits, so easy with register parameters) 
This may be way too late, but I wonder why AROS didn't ever define &quot;virtual registers&quot; which would have allowed the caller to write &lt;anything smaller than register width&gt; into &lt;whatever register with predefined width on that architecture&gt; and then on the library function side to extract &lt;whatever expected width&gt; for local use. 

* virtual register is 64 bit wide
* calling code writes an unsigned 32 bit value
* called code takes the lower 16 bit
* called code puts it into local unsigned 16 bit copy and uses it

On 68k it could be mostly no-ops, and on other architectures something else.


graphics.library  API  declarations  are  OS3.1-compatible.  If  the question  concerns  them, i would cast them to WORDs internally. As to graphics.hidd...  Well,  personally  i'm not against changing to WORDs (however, IIRC, coordinates are WORDs there).


amiga-m68k biggest game compatibility problem is &quot;wrong&quot; (RTG-like) struct bitmap format for planar screens, many system friendly (as in not taking over the system) games open screen normally but then write directly to screen's bitmap. How to fix this problem? I noticed there are already support (at least partial), for example macros like IS_HIDD_BM and OBTAIN_HIDD_BM. 

Isn't there a PlanarBM class in graphics.hidd that is basically a in-memory bitmap implementation that allows access to its rows of data? Possibly but application visible struct bitmap is still the BMF_SPECIALFMT one. 
My test was game Dune II that shows only red mouse cursor and blank screen. (Which also calls LoadRGB4() with NULL viewport, after that comes correct LoadRGB4() call..)
Just check screen's struct bitmap flags field and plane pointers? BMF_SPECIALFMT &quot;plane pointers&quot; are quite random looking, don't point to chip ram (if fast ram is available), compared to real plane pointers.</text>

==Introduction==

Libraries/Applications &quot;automagically&quot; open libraries that were available when they were compiled. If there is an issue, it would be easiest to downgrade the AROS version of graphics.library to 39 (in graphics.conf file) for the purpose of &quot;frankenrom&quot;. Another option: define global GfxBase variable somewhere in layers - this should prevent the &quot;automagic&quot; from working and thus you will need to open graphics manually.

* autoconfig (wip, fast ram expansions already work, autoboot rom support to do. Very important for UAE harddrive testing)

* expansion.library is currently set as noautolib. Is it because expansion (autoconfig) is not needed in non-Amiga systems or it needs to be initialized some other way? 

* utility.library math functions are ugly piece of work. Double return values (D0 and D1) - A0 and A1 must be preserved. Eww. Just eww. Looks like a bunch of ASM work needs to be done here for m68k. Did you check arch/.unmaintained/m68k-native/utility ? Only need to dynamically select between 68020+ and 68000/010 versions. 


Getting rid of the rom directory as different arch may put more or less modules in rom. Some arch may even make it configurable which modules to put in rom depending on how much non-volatile storage is available.
Having the rom/ directory make the m68k port easier, simply because only had to support the librom.a minimal AROS C library, not the full AROS C. In ABI V1 librom.a is gone. There is one library in arosstdc.library that will be usable by all modules. It will be initialized as one of the first modules. Therefore also the IO functions are moved to arosstdcdos.library that is disk based module. How are you handling the ctype.h family of functions? I would like to see an option for LANG=C only stripped down set. 

I think there should be defines for TaggedOpenLibrary() library id numbers. (but where? It should be only used by rom code). It would be quite useful in m68k-amiga because it makes rom file slightly smaller (currently there are lots of library name strings here and there).  UtilityBase = TaggedOpenLibrary(7); looks quite ugly.. 


workbench/libs/gallium: -Wall cleanup. Different enum types are being compared, and the compiler is unhappy. I looked at the enum lists for each type, and they seem very different. The code is like this in the trunk of main Mesa repo as well (workbench/libs/mesa/). 





===ROMmable===

I would like to suggest the following changes to the genmodule tool, to better support ROMmable modules: 

I have an alternative solution also used in the ABI V1 branch. The only assumption that is made is that LIBBASE of the library we are executing code in A6 (on i386 this is in *(%ebx) ). 

&lt;pre&gt;
* LIBBASESIZE:
   - Would have space for an additional BPTR for the library's SegList
   - Space for an additional N struct Library * slots after
     the end of LIBBASETYPE, where N is the number of auto-opened libraries.
   - These slots would hold the opened library handles for the
     auto-opened libraries. But I don't like this change but won't veto it. 
     It can always be reverted when proper support for global variables is 
     implemented in ROM linking and the ROM bootstrap code. 
     To me write-only media and write-able global variables sounds mutually
     exclusive. Well, actually *read*-only media and write-able global 
     variables sounds even more mutually exclusive ;-)
     Please outline how it would work for an EEPROM or alike. 
     EEPROM Very easy. In your linker script you declare .bss and .data sections 
     in RAM, whereas .rodata and .text are in ROM. At startup, the Kickstart copy 
     the .data section stored somewhere in ROM into proper location in RAM and 
     zeroes the .bss section. And at the same time we could replace the ROMtag 
     scanner with a list of modules that is generated at link time; for example 
     using the AROS symbolsets.  I thought &quot;binary compatibility&quot; goes both ways, 
     original rom modules work with Aros rom modules and vice versa.. 
     IMHO this is the worst solution. Chip RAM is too valuable for that. 
     Either modules are going to be proper fully rommable or _everything_ can be
     relocated to RAM by tiny relocator and expansion RAM configuration code in
     ROM. Anyway, both solutions are bad ideas for basic A500/A1200 modes which will
     kill my interest instantly. 

* set_open_libraries():
  - Would take LIBBASE as a parameter
  - Would OpenLibary() to the post-LIBBASETYPE Library *slots

* set_close_libraries()
  - Would take LIBBASE as a parameter
  - Would CloseLibary() the post-LIBBASETYPE Library *slots

* An additional header would be '-include libname_libraries.h', that
  would be autogenerated, and have lines like:

  #define GM_SEGLIST_SLOT (BPTR(((APTR *)(((IPTR)LIBBASE)+LIBBASESIZE))[0])
  #define UtilityBase     ((APTR *)(((IPTR)LIBBASE)+LIBBASESIZE))[1]
  #define GfxBase         ((APTR *)(((IPTR)LIBBASE)+LIBBASESIZE))[2]

  I don't want this; I did a big effort in the past to get rid of these
  '#define libbase' hacks. This code assumes that LIBBASE is available 
  in all functions that call a function of an autoopened library. 
  This assumption is false. If you see no other way out please only 
  implement when compiling the kobjs on m68k. I mean, genmodule could 
  supported two types of libraries (or just make a second genrommodule 
  for the sake of it). Whatever assumption is made, it would only apply 
  to code that is explicitely written/modified against that assumption...
...
&lt;/pre&gt;

To me there is no place in clean code for these #define hacks, they change the semantics of some code (struct
IntuitionBase *, function pointers to functions in amiga shared libraries, ...). 
It is incompatible with how the C library is implemented in ABI V1. The stubs code for stack based functions in a library needs the global libbase and a #define won't be noticed. Problem for C library still remains in ABI V1. Maybe a static C link library can be reintroduced in the arch/m68k-native tree, allow me to have what in my mind is a proper and clean m68k branch.

Constraints:

(1) Don't want to put BSS in (precious) Chip RAM
(2) Some machines have Fast RAM, some don't, so I can't *at compile time* determine where to link the .BSS to.
(3) Due to (1) and (2), .text cannot have absolute references to anything in the BSS - i.e. FooBase, BarBase, etc.

The '#define hacks' allow me to satisfy all constraints, and I do not plan to add them to the source code itself - only genmodule, and only when it is targeting a read-only ROM. 

The end result of all of this is that genmodule would run in two (target depenant) modes: .bss mode for disk loadable modules, and .rela.bss mode of ROM modules. Hmm... .rela.bss.... (/me thinks) 

Also I would be able to *remove* a lot of the '#define hacks' that already exists in the codebase, since only genmodule would need to be concerned about where to place the library handles. 

'''An alternative'''. Make a custom link script for the ROM that links all kobjs together with the BSS sections linked to the first page(s) of chip RAM. Bootstrap code would then need to copy the initialization values to this page. In a later stage on machines with a MMU to remap the ROM and the BSS section to fast RAM. 

In the _start.c file you would have the following

 const IPTR UtilityBase_offset = LIBBASESIZE+1*sizeof(APTR);

 const IPTR GfxBase_offset = LIBBASESIZE+2*sizeof(APTR);

Code should then do

&lt;pre&gt;
#include &lt;proto/utility_rel.h&gt;
#include &lt;proto/gfx_rel.h&gt;
in case of
#include &lt;proto/utility.h&gt;
#include &lt;proto/gfx.h&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

gfx_rel.h would #include &lt;inline/gfx_rel.h&gt;

and in inline/gfx_rel.h you would have the following:

&lt;pre&gt;
static inline void RectFill(...)
{
    extern const IPTR GfxBase_offset;
    struct GfxBase *GfxBase = (struct GfxBase *)((char *)(GET_A6)+GfxBase_offset);
    AROS_LC5NR(void, RectFill, ...)
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

This last code without inline can also be used in as stub in the static link library. The link library would be called libgfx_rel.a etc. 

If you look in the repository in the branch branches/ABI_V1/trunk-genmodule_pob/AROS/tools/genmodule you should find
most infrastructure there. Only GET_A6 is called GET_LIBBASE and is implemented as inline asm in aros/$cpu/cpu.h (only i386 ATM). Problem is that it can't be introduced in the main trunk without breaking bin compatibility in i386/x86_64 because there is no reg allocated now for that purpose. 

This would move the auto-opened libraries to the LibBase, out of BSS, making the process of building ROMmable libraries easier. No code changes would need to be made to existing libraries, and no ABIs would need to change.

I would think you need to pass LIBBASE as a parameter then to the function explicitly. You can still do this and put it in A6. The only quirk would be things like callbacks that are not listed in the .conf file, which would want to get handles to the library's opened libbases. How is that handled? Or should those callbacks be specified in the .conf? ReadStruct/WriteStruct are good examples. Their callback routines (in the Hook structure) will probably want to talk to both the LibBase class and DOSBase. 

Basically all code that currently uses libbases should provide also alternative code that uses the _offset variable. So in the ABI V1 branch for each library there is now libxxx.a and libxxx_rel.a static link library generated. The former will have stubs for the functions in the library using the global libbase, the latter stubs using _offset. If you
link code with the latter lib but don't define the _offset variable you get a linker error. 
The m68k ROM module would need to link -lxxx_rel (or uselibs=xxx_rel). 

For Hooks I think we need provide support for saving A6/LIBBASE in the Hook data and restore it by a special support HOOK function. Don't know if this is possible and if it would have impact on the number of arguments that can be passed. 

For the hooks I was looking at (datatypes.library, the LibBase was already in the Hook's h_Data. So I just added 
  struct DataTypesBase *DataTypesBase = hook-&gt;h_Data;
at the start of the hooks manually, and everything was good.

(I have a patch for datatypes.library that makes it ROMmable, using the '#define hack', putting the LibBases in the LIBBASETYPE explicitly, and explicitly opening them on the library's init, and modifying the hook routines as described above. 

Could BHFormat be reworked so that it doesn't open muimaster.library if run from the CLI? The system could ask inserting different disks. A CLI version of format could be included. System/Format could be reworked to get rid of some dependencies or at least work with the basic libraries (I don't think iffparse or datatypes should be required for formatting, but are subdependencies of muimaster.library.). How about reworking BHFormat to have a ./configure option to only use gadtools.library instead of MUI Master? I have to have gadtools in the ROM anyway for AmigaOS 3.x. 



Which ones should I work on making ROMable?

C/Shell - Yes! Shell is a good one since it's in the original kickstart and booting without Startup Sequence it allows you to perform operations without the need of accessing the HD, it's a good candidate. 

Libs/arosc.library - I suppose that since arosc.library may be used by various programs and system components it would be quite interesting to have it on ROM to be able to launch various apps from the shell. 

Libs/datatypes.library - I this requires datatypes on disk so I'm not sure having it in ROM would help much. It's nice to have because programs requiring it wouldn't fail loading but since there wouldn't be any datatype loaded I don't think it's necessary. 

Libs/muimaster.library - MUI uses external classes and I don't know if it allows loading apps without external classes present. If it does then it may be useful but if it doesn't then skip it. Lots of dependencies. 

Libs/asl.library - This may come very handy with an updated Shell with auto-completion...

Libs/diskfont.library - Not prioritary. If you want to load fonts from disk then you can also store diskfont.library on the same disk. 

Libs/gadtools.library - This may be useful for some basic apps. I can't remember if it's present in default KS, if it's not then it's not so high-priority. KS 3.0 seems to want it in ROM. Along with If, EndIf, and some other commands. 

System/Format - If you have a system capable of accessing writable media then you'll be able to access files outside rom too. It's a nice thing to have but IMHO &quot;Format&quot; is not a priority. 

The basic infrastructure for ROMmable shell commands. There seems to be an alignment issue, though, since sometimes it just works (adding 'shellcommands' to KRSRC), and sometimes get a hang. 
Can someone review the 'pure' changes I needed to make to workbench/c/shellcommands/Shell? Test the built shell, and it seems to work for trivial tasks. 


At first, found it a little difficult to program in the .bss and .data free Pure style, coming from a MMU OS (Linux) where shared executable pages are easy, and -fPIC compilers actually work. But coming to really really like the Pure style, and for AROS we should promote the style and advantages more. Here's, just off the top of my head, some of the best parts of Pure: 

All Pure programs/libraries can:
* have their .text segments marked read-only
* be linked into a ROM
* can have multiple executions of the same object, i.e. Shell[1], Shell[2], Shell[3] all share the same .text segment 

Due to the above, for low memory systems, Pure is a total win.
In an ideal world compilers wouldn't support BSS or data sections. All these MMU tricks etc. are just work-arounds for programmers' laziness. And don't get me started on garbage collection ;-) 
Yes, it's a little more work to code in Pure, but think it's worth it. 
I can't disagree more. In my mind the compiler and/or build infrastructure should make it possible to have pure programs using global variable, auto-opening libraries, etc. Then, this would require a '-fPIC Data' style, correct? Where the .text segment could be linked to any location, and there is a 'task global' (either a member of struct Task and/or a register) that points to the task's &quot;private&quot; .bss/.data area. 
This is similar to the Amiga BCPL support, in fact, and the tc_GlobVec pointer would be just the field to use, since it would essentially be providing the same service. But I'd hate to be the one to implement the compiler changes for all the supported AROS archs to make this happen. I'm more in favor of a register to use for storing the global pointer. It would be the same register also used for the libbase as it has similar function. On i386 ABI V1 I used %ebx for this; which is a stack pointer *(%ebx) is the place for storing the base. For m68k A6 would be used. 

-fPIC under ELF for most architectures wants to use a 'global offset table', and position independent code (which takes ANOTHER register out of the available pool). To make '-fPIC-data' - I'm not sure about how to do that easily. In adtools' gcc there is a --baserel options but I don't know much more than that it exists. 

Also I think that in the ABI V1 branch the base is there to have this possible. Please try to limit the code you convert to this Pure way of doing things. 

Can linker merge identical strings in rom? I noticed rom is full of dos.library, intuition.library etc.. strings? (and all kinds of debugging strings too). Wasn't that the purposed of exec.library's TaggedOpenLibrary() - it took a bunch of magic numbers and did the appropriate OpenLibrary(&quot;blah.library&quot;) for that number. That would solve the repeated string problem. 

Only do manual opening of libraries when really needed for backwards compatiblity. Don't do it for fun. 
The  main  goal was to make the program pure. This means - it can now be made resident using C:Resident.
Just the command is very small and i thought it is a good idea. It is not about the fact that it is small or large program. Problem is that code in repository is often taken as start by programmers to start
new projects. This way bad habits get spread. In the past I have spent considerable time to get rid of these manual opening of libraries often filled with bugs as the exception clauses are not in the common code
path. And it really hurts me every time I see this code being re-added. When in ABI V1 I do think to implement a compile switch that allows to make programs residentable without needing to do something. It is not for the near future but I hope you can wait that long. 






===Dos Library===

Autoconfig boot rom is now supported, UAE uaehf.device gets initialized properly but it crashes when it is time to init dos.library. AROS dos.library seems to be normal autoinit library but official roms do it differently. Well, what ACTUALLY seems to happen is the bootblock returns both D0 (error code) and A0 (pointer to a Resident rt_Init structure), and the Boot Block loader is supposed to MakeLibrary() with the rt_Init passed in. 
(assuming that the bootblock returned D0==0, then it also returned a Resident InitTable in A0). 

All autobooting harddrives' boot rom code do following at the end of boot phase:

&lt;pre&gt;
d0 = FindResident(&quot;dos.library&quot;);
move.l d0,a0
move.l RT_INIT(a0),a0
jsr (a0)
&lt;/pre&gt;

aros dos rt_init contains init tables, not code -&gt; crash. dos rt_init code initializes dos.library &quot;manually&quot;. InitResident() is not used for this. (dos is weird, even after BCPL was gone). 
The  first  thing  to do is to add an option to genmodule so as it is able  to generate libraries not relying on RTF_AUTOINIT flag. The rest is pretty straightforward. It will not harm other ports.
Some  time  ago  i  implemented  reverse  thing for resources (option resautoinit),  it  was  used for battclock.resource. It's very easy in fact. You can reuse existing genmodule's code for resources. 

How to do this without breaking non-m68k builds? How to disable autoinit and put init code pointer in rt_init?
Harddrive boot code includes final jsr or jmp in autoboot rom. It can't be patched.

Floppy boot code does return dos resident in A0. Which means it can be fixed without touching dos.

But nothing prevents floppy boot block to also having jsr(a0), it isn't going to return, it was only designed
this way to allow strap to free temporary resources (boot block buffer, trackdisk, etc..) before starting dos. 

Note that replacing AOS dos.library with AROS dos.library will not work, because it is very incompatible in things which interface with filesystems, starting processes (like the Shell/CLI stuff) and probably other stuff. 

MorphOS dos.library is based on AROS one but much more compatible to AOS. You would have more luck with that one. That is ... until you want to use other AROS components like filesstems which use FSA packet API, which will not work anymore. 

Currently latest problem is simply NewAddTask() getting or reading startup parameters (startup pc etc..) incorrectly and crashing because of bad initial PC. 

Couldn't the initial ROM be mostly a loader for disk based modules? Would love to, but afs.handler depends on Intuition, which depends on Graphics, Layers, oop, ..  This could probably be changed so that afs.handler only opens and uses intuition if intuition is already loaded at the time ithe handler wants to show a requester. It already checks if the first intuition screen is open beforehand. 

Shouldn't workbench/libs/partition be in rom/partition? Yes, the entire source tree could do with a clean up, and this has been discussed before on this dev list. It looks like a component you'd want to have to be able to boot from a hard disk on m68k. It is not needed, this is autobooting harddisk driver's task. (read partition tables, add partitions, add possible filesystems in RDB). Of course we don't need to simulate this with future rom built-in drivers. In existing ports it's used by the strap module to mount partitions, so it needs to be part of the kernel (or to be exact, loaded by the bootloader). 

Boot priority is already stored in the partition table. Only in RDB one. It's not stored anyhow on CDs, USB flash, etc. The priorities of unpartitioned removable media such as CDs and floppies have traditionally depended on the priority assigned to the drive they're in. Bootable USB sticks use SFS in an RDB and therefore have a priority
just like internal HDs. MBR partitions don't store priorities, but there are other reasons why their use for bootable volumes isn't recommended anyway (e.g. a custom device name can't be chosen). 

All existing graphics HIDDs seem to include attrbases tables that are not rommable. (writable data and bss). 
We actually have a BSS (ugh) on the m68k-amiga ROM. If you can deal with just having BSS, we're good.
A note/warning about performance loss. Hidd stubs do not generate error/warning now, if used in ROM-able code, but the performance will suffer drastically when they are in use. Instead of initializing the methodID only once, they will call oop.library/GetMethodID() upon every use of these stubs.  This cannot be fast... ;) 
Understood. I'll need to find a (clean) way to AllocMem() an area of all of the stubs in a class to use to store their MIDs. (just so everyone else knows, this slowdown should only impact m68k-amiga). Just committed changes to Intuition, Hyperlayers, and Graphics that remove the need for them to have .BSS and .DATA segments. This is required for the two-rom-split method of getting AROS into UAE. 

Is there some kind of framework for compiling and linking ROM build-in resident commands? (at least addresident and friends seem to be implemented. About pure binaries, look at C:Dir, some  commands  which  i backported from MorphOS are pure. In a short, they  don't  use  startup code and any global variables. That's all in fact.). 

Most KS2.0+ bootable disks require build-in resident commands and I guess boot shell should be some kind of resident program too. Programs in workbench/c/shellcommands can be integrated into shell binary. Look at macros there. They are   defined in shcommands_notembedded.h. And there is another file, shcommands_embedded.h. I don't know what is needed to make use of this feature. Looks like no-one has tried it for a while. 

Look under AROS/workbench/c/shellcommands/, you'll find programs that use a set of macros defined within AROS/compiler/include/aros/shcommands_notembedded.h.

Those macros expose an interface that should be reimplemented in shcommands_embedded.h in order to produce programs that can be embedded in ROM.

As of now, those macros let you produce reentrant code effortlessy, but unless you want to embed the produced files &quot;as is&quot; within the ROM and use LoadSeg() on them then (which could be a viable option, depending on your needs) then you need to write the embedded version of those macros. 

Those macros expose an interface that should be reimplemented in shcommands_embedded.h in order to produce programs that can be embedded in ROM. DOS/AddSegment() will be very useful as well. Have to hook FindSegment() into the LDDaemon to complete the picture...) I'll make sure to have the FindSegment() in LDDaemon at a *lower* priority than on-disk executables, so that we don't lock-in the ROM versions. 

Amiga IDE support is also in my &quot;implement soon&quot; list. Do I add #ifdefs to existing ata.device or do I need to do something else? (it seems to be too PC hardware specific and not exactly modular). I would go for separate module for Amiga. The ata.device is a &quot;touchy&quot; ;) subject - it has been broken many times by people trying to improve and there always seems to be not enough testers available after changes are made ;)

Most of those breakages are through necessity because the old code was severely handicaped/badly designed - personally I think its working extremely well these days since there are hardly any reports of it not working - if at all.  The only thing (imho) still needing to be done is to correct the initial probing code to not add legacy ports that haven't been associated with an ata controller, if it has found pci controllers with devices attached.

Im not sure how different the amiga's internal ide implementation is - but I would imagine it would be possible to move the bits that do differ (probing, programming the chipset directly) into separate files and only include those in your specific build .. e.g. dma_amiga.c 

I'm also not sure how the elbox fast ata etc. controllers work but it would be nice to have AROS able to support them also (I have 2 still, as well as 2 mediator PCI-bus boards). 

I checked NKD autodocs for 1.3 and 3.1 and in both cases these functions are described as returning BOOL. Please note that AROS aims to be compatible with 3.1 not with 1.3. You might need to completely separate dos library into arch tree if such changes are needed.

I also think this change might break binary compatibility on existing ports (BOOL is 2 bytes AFK while LONG is 4 bytes). The NDK autodocs for 1.3 and 3.1 and in both cases these functions are described as returning BOOL. Please note that AROS aims to be compatible with 3.1 not with 1.3. You might need to completely separate dos library into arch tree if such changes are needed.

what do I do with dos.conf? Lock/Open (and others) aren't aliases anymore. (dos.conf not committed) 
I think the easiest thing to do would be to make stub files in rom/dos/ for the aliases functions, then you can check in dos.conf that doesn't have the aliases. 

DevCD NDK 2.0 and 3.1 dos_protos.h:
&lt;snip&gt;
LONG Examine( BPTR lock, struct FileInfoBlock *fileInfoBlock );
LONG ExNext( BPTR lock, struct FileInfoBlock *fileInfoBlock );
LONG Info( BPTR lock, struct InfoData *parameterBlock );
&lt;/snip&gt;
Same in SAS-C include/clib/dos_protos.h. n fact BOOL and ULONG return types are binary compatible. In any way
the  value  is  returned  in  a CPU register, so it occupies the whole register. The  difference is only how it is evaluated. For example on m68k WORD would be evaluated using tst.w and ULONG - using tst.l. Just  NDK  3.1  definition guarantees that upper half of the register will not contain trash. 

WB3.0 C:Assign seems to do this: 
if (AssignLock(whatever, NULL) != DOSTRUE) then print &quot;can't cancel &gt; &lt;whatever&gt;&quot;. Failed. 
Unfortunately AssignLock return type is BOOL . Replace it with LONG (for example) and Assign works correctly.. 
Seems both are broken, as BOOL should be typedef'ed as &quot;short&quot; and AssignLock() really should be LONG according to original AOS includes. Ah, AssignLock returns LONG but AssignLate, AssignPath and AssignAdd return BOOL. (Mistake that was fixed in later version?) 

Testing KS 3.1 CreateNewProc():
CreateNewProc()'s NP_Arguments tag
Does NOT add &quot;\n&quot;. Input() DOES return NP_Arguments argument stream.
RunCommand():
Same results. Does not add &quot;\n&quot;, Input()+FGetC() returns command argument(s).
There was tiny difference: (probably due to different input handles) CreateNewProc() FGetC() returned EOF when argument stream ended. RunCommand() FGetC() waits for more characters (press return in CLI returned one linefeed) 
SystemTagList() test results: it seems to do everything (or is it shell that does it?)
All whitespace (spaces and tabs) swallowed between command and arguments. Trailing whitespace is not swallowed. 
If &quot;\n&quot; already in argument string = end of argument string. If no &quot;\n&quot; in argument string = add one at the end. 
CreateNewProc()'s NP_Arguments tag does NOT add &quot;\n&quot;. Input() DOES return NP_Arguments argument stream. 
Also without &quot;\n&quot; at the end of argument string RunCommand() FGets() does not return until return is pressed. 

C:Run does this (maybe others too?)
&lt;pre&gt;
olddir = CurrentDir(toclone);
cis = Open(&quot;&quot;, FMF_READ);
CurrentDir(olddir);
&lt;/pre&gt;

This can't work in dos packets mode. CurrentDir() takes and returns FileLocks, Open returns FileHandles.

Dos packet way of duplicating console handles (and only console handles) is: 
&lt;pre&gt;
old = SetConsoleTask(((struct FileHandle*)BADDR(toclone))-&gt;fh_Type);
cis = Open(&quot;*&quot;, MODE_OLDFILE);
SetConsoleTask(old);
&lt;/pre&gt;

Do we need special function for duplicating console handles or how to solve this incompatibility?
(at least until everyone switches to dos packets) Currently AROS C:Run hangs, WB2.x/3.x versions work. 


dos.library/MatchNext does not always return ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES when it finishes. 
(&quot;go out of for(;;) loop --&gt; MakeResult&quot; does not set ERROR_NO_MORE_ENTRIES) 
It confuses WB3.x:C/Dir. &quot;(null)&quot; appears in rightmost column if number of directory entries is odd. 
Never mind. It is not MatchNext bug (It works correctly, I was blind again) 
It is WB3.x:C/Dir misusing (?) VFPrintf (RawDoFmt), expecting %s with NULL pointer (not pointer to empty string) to produce nothing in output. 
KS 3.1 confirmed, RawDoFmt completely ignores %s if string pointer is NULL.  It does not attempt to access address zero either (confirmed with UAE memory watch points) 

 jsr        %a6@(76 * -6)    /* Exec/DoIO() */

Been noticed this several times already. Please use a named constant instead of a number and a comment; that way, the compiler can check that the offset if correct and people know which function you're calling. 
First I have to say: gcc 680x0 assembly syntax is HORRIBLE. (at least to anyone who started coding for Amiga in assembly in 1980s..). Sorry about that but I don't know (or want to know, see above) how to make working constants. This is Jason's problem :D 

GCC 68k also understand Motorola 68k syntax automatic. you can write jsr -(76*6)(a6) 
best is when you write 68k asm code as  a separate file. 
GCC asm detect for small .s or large .S, if your asm file have a large  .S (for example file have name myasm.S)then C define preprocessor can use in asm code too. 

&lt;pre&gt;
#define offset -76

#ifdef ...

jsr offset(a6)

#endif
&lt;/pre&gt;


Open() FMF_x parameters are a problem under m68k-amiga. (Used in many places inside rom modules and aros applications). It breaks SnoopDos and probably all other programs that take over dos/Open() vector. 

a) get rid of them completely? (are they actually even used?). go with this one. The new modes were never even documented in the Open() Autodoc AFAIK. They are [https://svn.aros.org/svn/aros/trunk/AROS/compiler/include/dos/filesystem.h documented] in and also quite used. I meant &quot;used&quot; as in &quot;actually does something different than only getting converted back to ACTION_FIND* in packet handler or most flags getting ignored in original non-dos packet version of afs.handler&quot;. Don't mind having some kind of NewOpen() with new better/extended mode flags but using original Open() with totally different and incompatible mode parameter can't be right. 

b) add some wrapper that converts FMF_ stuff to original MODE_xxxx parameters before calling Open(). (instead of wrapping them inside Open(), this is how it works in dos packets mode currently) 

My suggestion...

1) dos.library should be free of extensions, to be compatible with AmigaOS 3.1 up to the binary level (that extension I implemented years ago was supposed to be binary compatible as well, but In didn't take into account programs that would SetFunction() some of dos.library functions and take over them.

2) an arosdos.library could be implemented, or some hidds, or some other thing that would implement the extensions.

The scheme would be as follow
&lt;pre&gt;
    dos.library -----&gt; packet wrapper ---\
                                          \
&gt; aros dos handler
                                          /
    arosdos.library ---------------------/
&lt;/pre&gt;

There should be one packet handler wrapper per aros dos handler. In case of a dos handler based solely upon packets (a port from AmigaOS) then an aros-specific packet.handler would act as a wrapper around it, as it is now I think.

The immediate result of getting rid of those flags right now is that we would lose functionalities in the arosc.library (or however it's called in Staf's modifications) since they are implemented system-wide at the level of dos.library, like file append for instance. And pipefs would not work anymore (but it would need a rework anyway, since it's quite antiquated and doesn't really work well).

The idea would be to be &quot;future proof&quot;, and not fossilize on the old amigados packet handlers. Without a clear &quot;new dos&quot; project to push forward, though, the only viable options are: either keep everything as it is, trying to find the ways to be compatible with the AROS way *and* the AmigaOS way, or just go for the AmigaOS way.

This is the mapping in use:
&lt;pre&gt;
  #define FMF_MODE_OLDFILE   (FMF_AMIGADOS | FMF_WRITE | FMF_READ)
  #define FMF_MODE_READWRITE (FMF_MODE_OLDFILE | FMF_CREATE)
  #define FMF_MODE_NEWFILE   (FMF_MODE_READWRITE | FMF_LOCK | FMF_CLEAR)
&lt;/pre&gt;
As you see, MODE_NEWFILE would also create the file if it doesn't exists and clears it if it does, so you should not use it in that context. Use MODE_OLDFILE instead for everything.


What do with AROS code that allocates struct FileInfoBlock from stack? This does not guarantee required LONG alignment (BPTRs and m68k-amiga). Replace them with AllocDosObject()? But it adds yet another memory
allocation test and memory free call, I think it makes simple code. Too complex and ugly.

New macro that allocates from stack + hides the alignment hack? (preferably macro that also works with other DOS structures like InfoData too). 

Code like (from c/dir.c):
&lt;pre&gt;
UBYTE _fib[sizeof(struct FileInfoBlock) + 3];
struct FileInfoBlock *fib = (APTR) (((IPTR) _fib + 3) &amp; ~3);
&lt;/pre&gt;
is imho too ugly..

IMHO just use AllocDosObject(), since allocating. Is that really an issue with GCC? There are some alignment options for a lot of stuff from the int and long - and FileInfoBlock starts with a LONG (-malign-int). 




====BCPL_Action====

Anyway, all DOS structures introduced pre-2.0 should be allocated with AllocVec() because it was the BCPL way. 

trying to boot a Workbench 1.3 ADF. I'm able to load the 'Shell-Seg' Shell DOS process, but it's using the (nearly impossible to google) dos.library *BCPL* interface. 

I think it is not impossible to provide a 'thunk' from 1.3 BCPL interfaces to Library interfaces. Just A Small Matter of Programming. 

IF.. we can find documentation....

Here's a dump, where I have stubbed out the BCPL Action routine (stored in reg A5) with a debugging call. Ie:

The 'BCPL4Amiga.lha' archive on aminet.net is a *treasure trove* of information:

* How to call BCPL routines
* How the BCPL stack frame works (eww!!!)
* What D0/A1 is (it's NOT what I thought!)
* What almost all of the pr_GlobVec AmigaDOS offsets do!

I think I can make a BCPL thunking library from this, no problem!

If I can add this support, it would give AROS m68k the ability to run all the Amiga 1.0-1.3 BCPL CLI commands!

It'll give me something to do while I wait for Toni to finish the graphics drivers.

Actually, in this case, I do believe the printed English version of the Amiga Guru Book would be the best source of information. 

Hm, actually the C= guys tried to remove all BCPL stuff from AOS and explicitely replaced all the related CLI commands with C equivalents which go via DOSBase instead of a GlobVec - if I do read it correctly, with V37 only 4 BCPL handlers in L: where left. All remaining GlobVec legacy was re-implementing on top of dos.library - thus also avoiding the option to keep local copies of a jump table with modified entries for jump vectors.

Having a global (resp. local) non-library-based vector as jump table with both - public and private data entries, BSS and the ability of overlayed loading of different modules of a program, well, it could be considered both: very flexible or utterly broken ;-) The &quot;Chapter 16&quot; of the Guru Book &quot;BCPL and the Global Vector&quot; starts with a quote saying &quot;If you understand it, it's obsolete.&quot; 

IMHO it would be more useful to have all the C-based standard CLI commands and filesystem drivers from V37 and beyond working than old BCPL stuff. 

AOS 1.0-1.3 code/tools does not provide any missing functionality to a &quot;Frankenrom&quot;.

Of course a compatibility layer for other, non-OS BCPL code might be useful - but then again it may only be relevant for specific hardware drivers which are neither available for UAE nor most Amiga models. 

Basically just for anything that is not V37-aware and requires a GlobVec other than -1. Is that worth the overhead?

How (well) does MorphOS implement BCPL legacy? Or does one at most get a GlobVec of -1?

I would agree, but one of my unstated goals is to have AROS M68K be able to run all the Workbench ADFs that come with Amiga Forever.

Also, a number of 'magazine disks' use L:Shell-Seg. I'm going to work on supporting L:Shell-Sig from AOS 1.3 only for now, as that will bring in the maximum advantage to AROS m68k as a ROM replacement. 

The BCPL thunk code does not seem, at this time, to be taking up too much code space, and I'm putting it in arch/m68k-amiga/dos/, so it won't impact any other ports. 

Do not enable 32-bit fast ram boards, for some unknown reason booting hangs if it is enabled. This is now fixed. 
Normal pointer to BCPL conversion error in NIL handler, worked only accidentally. (It took ages to find this one..)
I guess BCPL pointer bugs will be the most common ones because no other port needs them. 
Perhaps it is possible to add some BCPL pointer debug check macros? For example check that pointer's 2 lowest bits are zero when converting to BCPL pointer and check that BCPL pointer points to expected memory range? (They nearly always points to non-existing ram if conversion is done twice or it is missing) 

There are not any other than original Commodore BCPL WB 1.x programs and related software like handlers. (Did anyone even have a BCPL compiler outside of Commodore?) It most likely didn't prevent non-BCPL programs from using BCPL features. Problem is finding them (maybe very old PD disk series?) 

should remember that BPTRs don't really exists on (all?) other ports.. 

It's the first one that is opened via diskfont.library/newfontcontensts.c. Don't know which one that is exactly, the file name is 20.

 +    ((BPTR*)BADDR(hunktab[last]))[0] = BNULL;

This should be already zeroed when hunktab was allocated. But it doesn't seem to be or it's overwritten later. 

I've added some more debug messages e.g. to KrnUnregisterModules, here comes a debug log that might help bit, you can see from addresses it is on a 64bit machine:

&lt;/pre&gt;



Many AROS programs have this:

&lt;pre&gt;
AROS_UFH3(__startup static ULONG, _start,
      AROS_UFHA(char *, argstr, A0),
      AROS_UFHA(ULONG, argsize, D0),
      AROS_UFHA(struct ExecBase *, sysbase, A6))
{
&lt;stuff&gt;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

A6 does not and can not contain SysBase in m68k-amiga port. It contains BCPL magic (actually most address registers contain undocumented BCPL stuff) and it is impossible to detect between normal and BCPL programs at runtime. (some can have normal C startup then do BCPL stuff later..) Are there any ports that do *not* have a global SysBase that user space can get to? Is the only way to get SysBase at program startup and library init on m68k by the absolute address $4? I think there should be a way to pass SysBase to a new program or library without needing an absolute address. The latter is especially difficult on hosted platforms. As a last resort we can do it again during loadseg so a symbol name SysBase gets the right value by the loader. I do prefer the current solution though. 

The loadseg way of initializing sysbase? Nothing. If you look at InternalLoadSeg_ELF, it already handles that case: rom/dos/internalloadseg_elf.c: Lines 388-406. So only (a) HUNK architectures that (b) don't have a global SysBase need SysBase passed to them. I don't think there are any of those under AROS. 
That a wrong strip of an executable will make it unusable. This linked with the fact that we plan to switch to ELF executables in the future and not relocatable objects. We still need relocation info in the file. 




===Intuition Library===

Unfortunately intuition and layers had other m68k build issues that made gfx HIDD testing impossible. OpenScreen() internals do not work. It is already partially fixed but at least one more problem remains. 

More important issue is that I can't seem to get mouse working (software nor hardware). IntuitionBase-&gt;ActiveMonitor is always NULL, intuition/misc.c only sets mouse if it is non-NULL. MySetPointerPos() is called and mouse oordinates change when I move the mouse. It looks like graphics subsystem thinks mouse is shared with other host
windows. aoHidd_Gfx_IsWindowed is set to FALSE. 

If old modeid is not available, openworkbench() selects 640x200 resolution but still uses original saved display dimensions. 

This causes visual problem (and huge chip ram usage) in situations where some RTG mode has been saved (for example 1024x768) but we are now booting with RTG board disabled (or removed), result is huge superbitmap native chipset screen in normal 640x200 resolution. Which is quite annoying. It should fall back to original nominal dimensions and depth if mode was missing. 

Perhaps boot menu screen selection and openworkbench screen mode selection should be merged? Both need similar special code to select the best mode, especially when using Amiga hardware (PAL/NTSC/RTG) 

Amiga port uses following &quot;default&quot; modes:

* 640x256 (PAL) or x512 (interlaced)
* 640x200 (NTSC) or x400 (interlaced)

Above modes use either 2 or 4 planes.
Yes boot menu is fine but the problem is initial screen (shell) default resolution and aros boot image resolution.
It is 640x200 on NTSC machines, 640x256 on PAL machines. (But both PAL and NTSC modes are added to mode database if chipset supports PAL/NTSC changes = ECS Agnus or newer) 
AROS m68k also adds early Picasso96 driver &quot;RTG&quot; support which means resolution of 640x480. Not all RTG Picasso96 drivers support PAL or NTSC -like mode resolutions. 
Only the gfx driver knows which is the best &quot;default&quot; mode unless some ugly checks are added to common code (like current boot screen resolution selection does). 

And finally, initial screen must be 2 planes only due to bandwidth and chip memory usage reasons but AROS boot image is 16 colors and assumes square pixels (=interlace needed) 

Other supported platforms can work with much simpler solution because they all support at least 256 color screens and there is no huge vram/blitter bandwidth bottlenecks. 

Interlaced and 4 planes only needed when opening boot screen image (for correct aspect ratio)
Use of 4 plane hires for boot menu or initial shell is too slow on OCS/ECS chipset. 

Perhaps some kind of function in gfx hidd that can be asked something like &quot;give me array of modeids+depths for x&quot; where x = boot menu, boot image or initial shell screen? (Remember that depth is required if planar mode) 

640x480x8 (if RTG mode, 640x400 or 640x512 may not be supported)



Intuition/monitorclass.c/SetPointerPos() includes hotspot offsets in HIDD_Gfx_SetCursorPos() coordinates which does not work with Amiga chipset if mouse sprite resolution is not same as screen resolution. (Most common case is lores sprite and hires screen)

Hotspot should be in sprite resolution pixels, not in screen resolution pixels.

For example if hotspot is -3, screen is hires and sprite is lores: Sprite is moved left -3 hires pixels, but it should be either -6 hires pixels of -3 lores pixels. (HIDD can easily convert this automatically, SetCursorShape already includes hotspot offset data)

amiga-m68k native mouse positioning works in all resolutions correctly if SetPointerPos() &quot;Take HotSpot into account&quot; is removed and hot spot offset is handled in HIDD.

HIDD  coordinates  are  top-left  corner  of  the sprite. Graphics  driver  has  no  clue about hotspot (except hosted, but it's there just for input reporting only). Sprite  coordinates  should  come  in sprite's resolution. Just previously  there  was  no  separate  sprite resolution. 

Sprite shape resolution != sprite positioning resolution.
Sprite shape is independant of positioning (at least on AGA, ECS and older have restrictions)
remember the sprites on AGA machines had positioning resolution independent on the screen resolution. Which meant the sprite moved with HiRes (or even SuperHiRes) resolution even on LoRes screen. There's a flag that has to be set in order for that to happen though.  The default setting is to have LowRes sprites on LowRes and HighRes screens and HighRes sprites on SuperHighRes screens.  The resolution is globally set for all sprites though.


Normally sprite has lores pixels but hires horizontal resolution.

-&gt; graphics driver needs to know hotspot offset. (or it needs to know mouse pointer resolution so that it can add correct offset). There's  no &quot;hotspot&quot; in the sprite. It's just a sprite. Hotspot is Intuition's thing. 
Doesn't  this  mean  that  sprite  position  should  be  specified in bitmap's  resolution?  Well,  in  &quot;positioning  resolution&quot;. Guess positioning  resolution == screen resolution. So, Intuition can adjust offsets.
In  fact  moving  mouse  pointer  is  actually  MoveSprite(). I added monitorclass method only for convenience. Added these methods to monitorclass  in  order  to  remove  hotspot  specification  from ChangeExtSpriteA().  Previously  hotspot  specification  was a private extension there. See SVN history. 

It can't unless Intuition knows the sprite resolution, which is the problem. Sprite position is always in screen resolution, this is not the problem. (Hardware may not support it but it is not Intuition's problem)

Yes, this is quite backwards way to do it (Move the mouse instead of moving the hotspot) but correct fix would require Intuition update so that it knows mouse resolution and at least I don't want to touch that stuff. This quick fix at least makes Amiga native modes usable (and afaik no one else uses hardware cursors so this won't affect other platforms)

Here is visual explanation because I am still not sure if my previous explanation was too confusing..

&lt;pre&gt;
Lets say we have following lores sprite image (standard mode in AOS)

00X00000
00XX0000
00XXX000
00XXXX00

It has hotspot offset of (2,0)

Now lets see how it looks on hires screen at (0,0)

(without hotspot offset, wrong positioning)
S000XX0000000000
0000XXXX00000000
0000XXXXXX000000
0000XXXXXXXX0000

(with 2,0 _hires_ pixel hotspot offset, still wrong positioning. This is what happened previously)

00S0XX0000000000
0000XXXX00000000
0000XXXXXX000000
0000XXXXXXXX0000

(with 2,0 _lores_ pixel hotspot offset, or 4 pixel hires, finally we have correct hotspot positioning)
0000SX0000000000
0000XXXX00000000
0000XXXXXX000000
0000XXXXXXXX0000

(S = hotspot)
&lt;/pre&gt;




===Icon Library===

In: workbench/libs/icon/./diskobjio.c is sdd_Stream a BPTR to a file, a pointer to a buffer, both? 
Where does sdd_Stream come from? 
This stuff comes from big endian struct reading/writing support in compiler/arossupport. The type of the stream can be whatever and depends on what the hook function wants it to be (is passed to functions like ReadStruct(), ...). 

icon.library uses dostreamhook() (in support.c) which needs stream to be a BPTR (file handle). 
support.c/ReadIcon_WB() does the initial ReadStruct() passing &quot;file&quot; param (BPTR) as stream value. 


icon resizing only kicks in if an icon's Gadget-&gt;MutalExclude has (1 &lt;&lt; 31) set, so all old icons should continue to be displayed pixel-for-pixel. 

ilbmtoicon now accepts a --dpi x:y parameter (default is 72:72, the old Macintosh desktop publishing resolution) to allow you to specify the icon's default resolution in dots-per-inch. 

This is translated into Amiga Display Resolution Ticks, so that the icon.library logic doesn't need to do any unit conversion. 

The icon scaling is a bit rough, but it is fast for C code. (Could be faster if someone would implement the HIDD hooks for CyberGfx/ScalePixelArray..). 

BitMap icons are scaled with BitMapScale(), and ARGB icons are scaled using a Bresenham rescaler (needs to be extended to average pixels when scaling up), since BitMapScale() appears to clobber the 'A' portion of ARGB bitmaps.

As I noted in my commit message, I need to add an additional tag to IconControl to help Wanderer control icon scaling. 

We should also put in an override in Prefs/ScreenMode to allow the adjustment of screen DPI/DPC too, via the MonitorSpec ratioh/ratiov parameters. 
From my understanding, the display width/height ratio defines (or has an impact on) the pixel width/height ratio. E.g. if a single pixel is square by default, running the display in a different resolution than the one which it physically provides may change that aspect. 

From my testing on AOS 3.9, MonitorSpec's ratioh/ratiov do not change (ie, they are always RATIO_UNITY) regardless of the screen mode (even 1280x200 NTSC was ratioh=16, ratiov=16) 

Therefore, I believe those parameters do not reflect the pixel size, but the monitor size itself.

As for DRI Resolution, I believe that the equations I have posted are a good approximation of the AOS behavior, and allow extension to other display formats (widescreen, portrait mode, etc) 

MonitorSpec ratioh and ratiov are fixed-point fractions, are defined by the RATIO_FIXEDPART and RATIO_UNITY macros. 

&lt;pre&gt;
#define RATIO_FIXEDPART  4
#define RATIO_UNITY      (1 &lt;&lt; RATIO_FIXEDPART)
&lt;/pre&gt;

What they are a ratio *of* is still a bit of a mystery. Maybe a ratio of 'this monitor' versus a 1084S? 

It's a little related. MonitorSpec's ratioh and ratiov always appear to be RATIO_UNITY (1.0) on AOS, so I'm going to have AROS calculate ratioh and ratiov like this 

&lt;pre&gt;
#define C_1084_HEIGHT    198 /* mm */
#define C_1084_WIDTH    264 /* mm */

if (GetMonitorEDIDSize(..,&amp;MonitorEDIDWidthMM, &amp;MonitorEDIDHeightMM)) {
  ms-&gt;ratiow = ((MonitorEDIDWidthMM)&lt;&lt;RATIO_FIXEDPART)/264;
  ms-&gt;ratioh = ((MonitorEDIDHeightMM)&lt;&lt;RATIO_FIXEDPART)/198;
} else {
  ms-&gt;ratiow = RATIO_UNITY;
  ms-&gt;ratioh = RATIO_UNITY;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Monitors that comply with the VESA EDID spec will have MonitorEDIDWidthMM and MonitorEDIDHeightMM set from the EDID
information, and all others will assume a 4:3 13&quot; monitor. 

A Screen's DrawInfo 'Resolution' parameter (in 'ticks') would be calculated as

&lt;pre&gt;
res.x = 44*320/screen_pixel_width
res.y = 44*256/screen_pixel_height
&lt;/pre&gt;

(res.y will be slightly different for Amiga NTSC screens, with a value of 56 for 200 rows instead of 52, but that should not be a big problem)

With this information, an application can calculate a display's DPI as:

&lt;pre&gt;
#define C_1084_WIDTH_FIN  0xa6  /* 10.4 &quot; * 16 in hex */
#define C_1084_HEIGHT_FIN 0x7c  /*  7.8 &quot; * 16 in hex */

DPI.x = (screen_pixel_width &lt;&lt; (RATIO_FIXEDPART * 2)) / (ms-&gt;ratioh * C_1084_WIDTH_FIN);
DPI.y = (screen_pixel_height &lt;&lt; (RATIO_FIXEDPART * 2)) / (ms-&gt;ratiov * C_1084_HEIGHT_FIN);
&lt;/pre&gt;

.. and then, I will have enough information to dynamically rescale icons based upon DPI and aspect ratio of the screen. 

MonitorSpec: ratioh, ratiov - ratio between size of a 1084S and the current monitor (larger fractions are larger monitors, smaller are smaller)

DrawInfo Resolution: Since this is related to mouse ticks, it would make more sense for this calculation to be a inverse relationship to overall DPI, instead of to the number of pixels in the display. 

Therefore, DrawInfo.Resolution would be calculated as:

&lt;pre&gt;
  res.x = (1280 * 11 * ratioh / pixel_width)  &gt;&gt; RATIO_FIXEDPART
  res.y = (1024 * 11 * ratiov / pixel_height) &gt;&gt; RATIO_FIXEDPART
&lt;/pre&gt;

Screen DPI can be directly calculated from DrawInfo Resolution as:

&lt;pre&gt;
#define C_1084_WIDTH_CIN  104  /* 10.4 &quot; in centi-inches */
#define C_1084_HEIGHT_CIN  78  /*  7.8 &quot; in centi-inches */

  dpi.x = (11 * 1280 * 10) / C_1084_WIDTH_FIN  / res.x
  dpi.y = (11 * 1024 * 10) / C_1084_HEIGHT_FIN / res.y
&lt;/pre&gt;

Screen DPC (dots per centimeter) is calculated as:

&lt;pre&gt;
#define C_1084_WIDTH_MM  264  /* 10.4 &quot; in mm */
#define C_1084_HEIGHT_MM  198  /*  7.8 &quot; in mm */

  dpc.x = 11 * 1280 * 10 / C_1084_WIDTH_MM  / res.x
  dpc.y = 11 * 1024 * 10 / C_1084_HEIGHT_MM / res.y
&lt;/pre&gt;


From my understanding, the display width/height ratio defines (or has an impact on) the pixel width/height ratio. E.g. if a single pixel is square by default, running the display in a different resolution than the one which it physically provides may change that aspect. 

IMHO the xAspect/yAspect fields in the ILBM BMHD chunk are related, when it comes to interpreting similar values in graphics/monitors.

See: http://amigan.1emu.net/reg/ILBM.txt

&quot;Typical values for aspect ratio are width : height = 10 : 11 (Amiga 320 x 200 display) and 1 : 1 (Macintosh*).&quot;

and from EA's ilbm.h:

&lt;pre&gt;
&quot;/* Aspect ratios: The proper fraction xAspect/yAspect represents the pixel
* aspect ratio pixel_width/pixel_height.
*
* For the 4 Amiga display modes:
*  320 x 200: 10/11  (these pixels are taller than they are wide)
*  320 x 400: 20/11
*  640 x 200:  5/11
*  640 x 400: 10/11          */
#define x320x200Aspect 10L
#define y320x200Aspect 11L
#define x320x400Aspect 20L
#define y320x400Aspect 11L

and here's another interesting remark:

http://vlists.pepperfish.net/pipermail/netsurf-commits-netsurf-browser.org/2011-July/010011.html

&lt;pre&gt;
&quot;/* AmigaOS sees 4:3 modes as square in the DisplayInfo database,
* so we correct 16:10 modes to square for widescreen displays. */
xres = (xres * 16) / 4;
yres = (yres * 10) / 3;&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

(this overrides the DI.Resolution.x and DI.Resolution.y)




===diskfont Library===

Only fixed.font or does all fonts have same problem? 
Isn't it like that amiga fonts are actually hunk binaries?

Yes but I wanted to know if all hunk binaries fail or just some font on non-m68k ports.

Enable internalloadseg_aos.c debugging and include related log messages, maybe it helps to find the problem (I still can't see anything wrong :() 

Here is the log up to segfault in FixFonts:

===graphics library===

Dynamic allocation of pixbuf for BlkMaskBitMapRastPort() patch does 

* Eliminates the need for the pixbuf semaphores (improving concurrency)
* Dynamically allocates pixbuf as needed
* Moves NUMPIX to the bltmaskbitmaprastport.c file, and documents it
* We can now handle source images where width * sizeof(HIDDT_Pixel) exceeds NUMPIX, so long as we have enough memory available. 

Small comment: Please create graphics' private memory poll and use polled memory allocation functions, i.e. AllocPolled/FreePolled. Very frequent calls of regular, non polled memory allocations are good candidate for performance loss. AROS should get a better memory allocator. The current mem allocator is a speed brake if you use frequently allocs /free which C++ programs do. Or use arosc for malloc a better mem handler ?. if so, the patch Jason do should use malloc. The memallocs in the patch can too large to work in a pool. So even if poolmem is used, the alloc will go straight to a alloc of non pooled mem mostly. 

Pools are great for collections of items of identical size, but that is not the case here.

For this type of usage (variable size, unknown maximum size), pools are not very helpful. 
Both of these statements are just theory unless proven by some benchmarks. 
Personally I would think memory pools is advisable, if not for speed then for memory fragmentation or be able to deallocate a whole bunch of allocated memory with one DeletePool command. The latter is IMO most
usable during clean up. 

malloc cannot be currently used in AROS libraries as it is allocated on calling task context. 
And arosc malloc/free just uses a memory pool and AllocPooled/FreePooled ... 

What is the minimum size for 'NUMPIX'? The default (50000) leads to an allocate of 200000 bytes when graphics.library is initted. That's a little much for a buffer that is used by only a few functions. 
This gets you 200x250 pixels bitmap which is not that much TBH. Maybe you could change the implementation to allocation the buffer dynamically? The Root BitMap class does this for several calls (BM__Hidd_BitMap__PutAlphaImage, BM__Hidd_BitMap__PutTemplate, BM__Hidd_BitMap__PutAlphaTemplate, etc).
Alternatively, please ifdef it for m68k - decreasing this value in general will mean more instances of smaller VRAM-&gt;RAM reads which will probably slow down the operations. 





===workbench Library===

Wrote Wanderer:Tools/Info at line 58 there is: 
 #define USE_TEXTEDITOR 1
I suppose you could try with 0 there

SYS:System/Wanderer/Tools/ExecuteStartup is missing an icon. (deleted
in revision 34053, shouldn't there be replacement?)

No icon -&gt; OpenWorkbenchObjectA() opens a CLI output window because
GetIconTags(&quot;ExecuteStartup&quot;) returns isDefaultIcon=TRUE.

Just wondering why no one has noticed this previously unless there is
some other reason for hidden console window.
(only tested using m68k-amiga port)

Looking at workbench.library/wanderer as sources well and noticed the AppMenu and AppIcon didn't seem to be quite implemented yet. It looks like wbhandler.h should have a type added for update AppMenu after update AppIcon, and the library code should send update (AppIcon|AppMenu) messages to the registered port for the event types after they're succesful in adding/removing their list changes. Yes, workbench.library needs a bit of work. Was 'RegisterWorkbench()' an AROS specific improvement, or is there an AOS equivalent? 
Seems aros specific, the ol' being AlohaWorkbench(), dating back to ... hmm... well, so heck lot long time back, but it's intentionally left undocumented as the sole purpose is to register ... workbench, as ... workbench. Appendix C, page 2,... AlohaWorkbench() - This routine allows the Workbench tool to make its presence and departure known to Intuition. 

AlohaWorkbench() - In Hawaiian, &quot;aloha&quot; means both hello and goodbye. The AlohaWorkbench() routine allows the Workbench program to inform Intuition that it has become active and that it is shutting down. 

This routine is called with one of two kinds  of arguments-either a pointer to an initialized message port (which designates that Workbench is active and communications can take place), or NULL to designate that the Workbench tool is shutting down. 

When the message port is active, Intuition will send IntuiMessages to it. The messages will have the  Class field set to WBENCHMESSAGE. The  Code field will equal either WBENCHOPEN or WBENCHCLOSE, depending  on whether the Workbench application should open or close its windows. Intuition assumes that Workbench will comply, so as soon as the message is replied to, Intuition proceeds with the expectation that the windows have been opened or closed accordingly. 

The procedure synopsis is:  

&lt;pre&gt;
AlohaWorkbench(WBPort) 

WBPort - a pointer to an initialized MsgPort structure in which the special communications are to take place. 
&lt;/pre&gt;

I'm not sure its the same function, but something was written in an old amigamail or devcon article about similar functionality being supported (I've lost my paper copies over the years). dopus magellan is probably the best possibility for a real commercial client. 

Ideally folks should be able to have multiple workbench.library clients running as in a multi-screen workbench program. 

An app writer might want to implement workbench drawer navigation and file handling features for use on its own public screen  along with having its AppWindows (not being on the Workbench screen) for drag and
drop, in place of file requesters. They might want to go as far as doing their own drawer window code equivalents using PROGDIR: as a root window and showing only their project files or only supported clipart file types by showing the actual clip and not the icon image. 



===mathffp.library===

Building mathffp.library. Fixed, I forgot to commit header file modifications..  (btw, could someone fix lh_SysBase == NULL problem?). use BNULL for BPTR NULLs. You know what I am going to say ... :) Just add support for .bss in the ROMs by hard linking it to an absolute address. Not going to happen. Chip RAM is precious, slow, and the only RAM guaranteed to be on all Amiga models. If I hard linked the .bss, I would have to use Chip RAM, which would reduce the amount of RAM available for DMAable bitmaps, floppy tracks, and audio. Using space in the library's handle (which is allocated in Fast RAM if it is available) is a much better solution. Then do what I did previously with my drivers. Store method IDs in the library base and do not use the stubs (they weren't meant for ROM code without .bss anyway) :-D  

This is again m68k-amiga specific which can't expect FPU but still needs to support floating point. 
Which means we need to do it &quot;amiga way&quot; and use mathieeedoubxxx libraries. (non-amiga way would be trapping FPU exceptions, this is only allowed when emulating missing 040/060 fpu functions :)) 

Is the correct way to do this to replace gcc math C library functions with stubs that call IEEDP library functions? (and put lib bases in aros_privdata) 

IEEEDP functions then either use software versions or inline asm fpu versions of math functions (replace lib vectors with FPU functions when library is opened) 


Math libraries have few known m68k related problems.

Cmp() and Tst() functions are documented to return correct set 68k flags which is impossible with plain C
SetSR() sets the codes but final copy to D0 resets all flags.. (all math lib SetSR() calls are useless in m68k C code). 

Only FFP Cmp() and Tst() have assembly fixes, other FFP functions still return at least wrong N-flag (FFP sign bit is bit 7, not 31), fortunately IEEE signbit it bit 31. I'll try to fix IEEE Cmp() and
Tst() later, Jason can attempt to fix other return code problems if still interested :) 

Also Autodocs are slightly incorrect, for example Cmp() and Tst() are documented as always returning V=0 which is impossible because V flag is set/reset by m68k CMP and is required by bgt and other branch ommands.. (which are documented as working with math libs!) 

Linking with -libm should solve the issue. If it's already linked with -libm then I wouldn't know why it's not working. It is not yet done because it isn't that simple, proper m68k Amiga way is to redirect compiler math libs to math libraries in LIBS: (LIBS: math libraries then use either software or FPU depending on hardware config). 

Is there something that needs to be done before LC_LIBDEFS_FILE can work in overridden c-file? 
I tried to override mathieeedoubbas/mathieeedoubbas_init.c  (as arch/m68k-all/mathieeedoubbas/ mathieeedoubbas_init.c) to support m68k FPU functions. Already included ieeedpbas_fpu.c can't be used on
m68k-amiga because AOS C-library math functions should call math lib functions internally, not the other way round. 

 /home/twilen/aros/arch/m68k-all/mathieeedoubbas/./mathieeedoubbas_init.c:11:10: error: #include expects &quot;FILENAME&quot; or &lt;FILENAME&gt;. This define is handled by the %build_module macro but not by the %build_archspecific macro. It will need to be implemented in config/make.tmpl if needed. 
Oops, I forgot to reply that LC_LIBDEFS_FILE wasn't really needed. I overrode if because I didn't want to add yet another idef _m68000 and because m68k FPU routines should always use FPU instructions, even if
m68k AROS setup is compiled to be 68000 compatible (which is true today). Init routine then patches function pointers at runtime if FPU is detected. 

btw, IEEE Div and Mul software versions are not implemented, anyone can implement these? 



68040 and 68060 don't implement all instructions in hardware that older
CPUs and FPUs supported (some rarely used instructions and FPU
instructions like sin and cos)
Motorola distributed assembly code (including sources) that implement
software emulation of missing instructions, for example Commodore and
accelerator manufacturers included it with 68040 or 68060.library.
(I guess everyone already knew that?)

Motorola's emulation files come with following licence, is this AROS
compatible?
It should be, for example it is included with netbsd but I'd like to
have confirmation before it becomes part of m68k-all.

%build_module does not support asmfiles. Could anyone more familiar with this stuff add support? 

I need asmfiles support to build 040/060 missing instruction emulation module. It is m68k-only, there is nothing to override and it requires m68k assembly. 

I assume r38541 and r38542 are those Motorola codes, right? What about files in m68k-all/mathieeedoubbas. Is this Motorola code as well? Actually, that's just the 'normal 68882 FPU' instructions.
Toni's talking about a seperate issue, which is the emulation code from motorola to support partially implemented FPU instructions on the 68040 and 68060 (which had most, but not all, of the 68882 FPU in them). 

Yes, some rarely used non-FPU instructions are missing. They are also
handled by emulation code.

&lt;snip&gt;
The unimplemented integer instructions are:
    64-bit divide
    64-bit multiply
    movep
    cmp2
    chk2
    cas (w/ a misaligned effective address)
    cas2
&lt;/snip&gt;




===lowlevel.library===

 trunk/AROS/rom/devs/keyboard/keyboard.c
 trunk/AROS/rom/devs/keyboard/keyboard_intern.h

Lowlevel.library is not a rom module (it is rom in cd32-only) and also there is no amiga hardware specific implementation yet = on-disk original version must be supported.

Without this hack you only get random memory corruption that is really difficult to debug when lowlevel.library is expunged (for example whdload does this at startup)

Better question is: how does original keyboard.device survive? Perhaps it does not use (or even need) opener specific structures? Is there any test case/test application that can be used to compare results AROS vs OS3.1? I assume there is nothing about this in RKMs/Guru Book and we can't disassemble the KS binaries to check. Multiple OpenDevice(&quot;keyboard.device&quot;) on KS3.1 return static value in io_Unit field. (Pointer relative to keyboard.device base address). I'd say there is no need for opener-specific KBUnit structure. (Perhaps original keyboard.device only works properly when there is single opener?). 





===reqtools.library===

Original m68k reqtools.library gadgets also have some problems, all button gadgets are not visible but they do work when clicked (and they even become visible permanently after clicking them once) 

Perhaps this is related: Deluxe Paint 2 and 3 (not tested others, 2 and 3 used for overlay tests) button gadgets have similar graphics glitches. 

Button text/label becomes permanently invisible after it has been clicked once (or if gadget was originally drawn as active) 


Its possible that fid-&gt;fid_EdgesOnly  is 0.should 1 if it is draw later,

I get in mind, frameiclass, is lots modify for AFA.I send you the file private, maybe you see difference.

Some time i have post the problems AFA have with AROS code.I think this 2 are also maybe possible.
Have you check if this problems are not in AROS 68k ?

I mean text in wb 3.9 about Req is correct show.

//RemoveClass(FindClass(&quot;itexticlass&quot;)); // text in WB 3.9 about is not written.
//BOOPSI_ITextIClass_Startup_lib();
//////
//RemoveClass(FindClass(&quot;frbuttonclass&quot;)); // gadget boxes are too large
//BOOPSI_FrButtonClass_Startup_lib();

but in the last functions i don't know what to fix, i deactivate them

I am quite sure reqtools uses standard intuition gadgets (it was 1.3 compatible for a long time), not boopsi. 
reqtools 68k call this code, maybe you add some debug code to look also if fid-&gt;fid_EdgesOnly = 0 or 1. 
I disabled EdgesOnly test: no effect on hidden button gadgets. 

&lt;pre&gt;
IPTR FrameIClass__IM_DRAW(Class *cl, struct Image *im, struct impDraw *msg)
{
    DEBUG_IFRAME(dprintf(&quot;dispatch_frameiclass: draw Width %ld Height %ld\n&quot;,im-&gt;Width,
im-&gt;Height));
    //kprintf(&quot;%ld %ld\n&quot;,im-&gt;Width,im-&gt;Height);
    return draw_frameiclass(cl, im, msg, im-&gt;Width, im-&gt;Height);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

I noticed RefreshBoolGadgetState() is called when selection state changes and it looks ok at that point but something after this call clears the label text. Maybe you try out to skip draw_frameiclass(cl, im, msg, im-&gt;Width, im-&gt;Height)
No effect either (on hidden buttons, gadgets started to look strange of course). I just noticed it is the backfill pattern that overwrites the gadget because gadtools demo part that shows non-backfill window works correctly. 

its not use by many software, if then text is not overwritten, you can be sure something in frameiclass. I guess all Aros native programs use boopsi if no one has noticed this previously. 



===wbversion===

the installer script does not accept aros by the Version.I get message i should use Kick 3.1. 
So is it possible that AROS wbversion is compatible to AOS and show that AROS is at least kick 3.1 ? 

fails here
; Have the  KS3.1
(if (&lt; #wbversion 40)
(   (exit #msg-badkick (quiet))
     ))

How is #wbversion set? What version of Scalos is this and where can it be downloaded from?
#wbversion is defined by looking at libs:version.library's version:

from scalos'installer script 
 (set #wbversion (/ (getversion &quot;Libs:version.library&quot;) 65536))

I don't think there is a version.library in AROS. I guess this explains the failure.

It doesn't have any functions, does it? M68k software surely assumes it exists. It has no extra functions but it can be expunged normally. 


I found this with codesearch:

&lt;pre&gt;
const char *amigaGetOSVersion(void)
{
   static const char *osver[] = { &quot;2.0&quot;,&quot;2.0x&quot;,&quot;2.1&quot;,&quot;3.0&quot;,&quot;3.1&quot;,&quot;3.2&quot;,&quot;3.3&quot;,&quot;3.4&quot;,&quot;3.5&quot;,&quot;3.9&quot;,&quot;3.9&quot;,&quot;3.9&quot;,&quot;3.9&quot;,&quot;3.9&quot;,&quot;4.0pre&quot;,&quot;4.0pre&quot;,&quot;4.0&quot; };
   int ver = SysBase-&gt;LibNode.lib_Version;
   #ifndef __amigaos4__
   if (ver &gt;= 40 &amp;&amp; ver &lt; 50) {   // Detect OS 3.5/3.9
      struct Library *VersionBase;
      if ((VersionBase = OpenLibrary(&quot;version.library&quot;,0))) {
         ver = VersionBase-&gt;lib_Version;
         CloseLibrary(VersionBase);
      }
   }
   #endif
   #ifdef __POWERUP__
   if (FindResident(&quot;MorphOS&quot;) &amp;&amp; ver &gt; 45) ver = 45;
   #endif
   if (ver &lt; 36) ver = 36;
   else if (ver &gt; 51) ver = 51;
   return osver[ver-36];
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Looks like all we have to do is to set lib_Version to 40 for OS3.1.




===Zune===

global.prefs is incompatible with m68k-amiga. It has little-endian data included that crash m68k-amiga TextEditor mui class. For example decimal 500 is read as F4010000 when TextEditor asks for MUIM_GetConfigItem / MUICFG_TextEditor_UndoSize. Class is fixed (that prevented it to initialize), prefs problem is different problem and only solution currently is to delete the prefs file. 
If it *is* supported to be cross-platform, all data should be big-endian (since Classic AmigaOS is our lowest common denominator, and Big Endian is easier to read by eye in a hex dump!) 

I see a few of those where IPTR is reverted to ULONG (probably not good on x86_64?). Take a second look at the #ifdef __AROS__ lines added above that code. 

I believe the SDI_hook.h and SDI_compiler.h changes are stable, and ready to backport.
I would like to proposes that we have a top-level workbench/libs/SDI, that has the 'master' versions of the SDI headers for AROS, that are installed in :Development/Include/. Current packages that use SDI should then pick those up, instead of the (probably stale) versions in their local includes. 
Does not make much sense to me when there is already compiler/include (and technicaly it isnt a library so workbench/libs isnt the place for it). AROS should only have one version of SDI (hopefully the most current!) in its tree, not four or fix copies of different revisions. 

On a different note, I can't figure out how to make the SDI varadic VA_* macros work for the AROS architectures that use non-uniform varadic arrays. (x86_64 specifically). Currently on AROS we have some quote elaborate macros (and helper functions) for the following cases: 

&lt;pre&gt;
IPTR func(LONG dummy, Tag tag1, ...)
{
   AROS_SLOWSTACKTAGS_PRE(tag1)
   retval = funcA(dummy, AROS_SLOWSTACKTAGS_ARG(tag1));
   AROS_SLOWSTACKTAGS_POST
}
&lt;/pre&gt;
and
&lt;pre&gt;
IPTR  func(Class *cl, Object *obj, ULONG MethodID, ...)
{
  AROS_SLOWSTACKMETHODS_PRE(MethodID)
  retval = funcA(cl, obj, AROS_SLOWSTACKMETHODS_ARG(MethodID))
  
  AROS_SLOWSTACKMETHODS_POST
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



==Contrib==

Package-Startup is executed from its parent directory. So it adds &quot;system:extras/Zune/MCC_NList/Classes&quot; to Libs: 


This compliciate part of Startup-Sequence reads all variables in env:sys/packages. The variables contain the path to s/Package-Startup. 
 
&lt;pre&gt;
If EXISTS ENV:SYS/Packages
    List ENV:SYS/Packages NOHEAD FILES TO T:P LFORMAT=&quot;If EXISTS
${SYS/Packages/%N}*NCD ${SYS/Packages/%N}*NIf EXISTS
S/Package-Startup*NExecute S/Package-Startup*NEndif*NEndif*N&quot;
    Execute T:P
    Delete T:P QUIET
    CD SYS:
EndIf
&lt;/pre&gt;

Someone bored enough should help to fix m68k compilation problems in contrib :)
what compiler error you get ? maybe you try to compile contrib with old compiler(best switch off optimizer in GCC to avoid broken programs)and old AROS 68k macro files in 68k.cpu.h 

I notice that the macros Mason have do for GCC 4.5.0 do not work for compile AFA(with GCC 3.4.0 and GCC 4.5.0), only old AROS macro and GCC 3.4.0 work ok. 

But in theory it should work when i change libcall.h and cpu.h.

macro errors get more visible, when you compile with Option -E, so only the preprocessor stuff is done and the asscii file is save.this i send Jason some time ago.He did not answer.here are the mails i send him. 

this zune file or arossupport.c

when i use old libbcall.h all work.I have it attach(currently it is names as libbcall.h_ because i use your file)

here is full log output of amidevcpp.

-E option i use to get preprocessor error output.when i use not -E i get only a syntax error which is not precise. strange that AROS work.

on line 18 there is just a simple call of that.

return MUI_NewObjectA(classname, &amp;tag1); 

but it happen also on LHA macros. Currently only working compiler is latest + Jason's A6 gcc register
patch. (and this surely has nothing to do with possible compiler problems)

btw, there is something wrong with either aros mui or libraries when also using native amigaos libraries. Scout crashes due to corrupt region pointer when calling DisposeRegion (or was it ClearRegion). (I was trying to use amigaos nlist because aros version does not compile) Region pointer points to some strange string data. Debugging memory overflows/corruption is sooooo boring.. 


I think here is problem that sdi includes does think its 68k and use 68k kompiler syntax.
to see whats really wrong use compiler option -E and post preprocessor file, because sdi use so many
nested macros.

If the output of -E in functionheader show something as this and have a asm command in, that's wrong
for new compiler.

funcname(char *args __asm(&quot;a0&quot;) )

&gt; /home/twilen/AROS/contrib/bgui/examples/FieldList.h:150:21: error: too

this is different.maybe a wrong prototype of SetFLAttr.if not here you can too look when compiler
Option -E is set in makefile, whats the full sourceline without macros in it.

&gt;
&gt; btw, there is something wrong with either aros mui or libraries when
&gt; also using native amigaos libraries. Scout crashes due to corrupt
&gt; region pointer when calling DisposeRegion (or was it ClearRegion).

as far i remember there is on AROS different lib slot usage of zune MUI API.I fix offsets for AFA, but i don't know  whats different.I send you the AFA muimaster.h defines privat, attachments here not work. 

because all of the OOP stuff in amiga is due to black box concept and much work need for add a feature, very limit implement and many features are miss.that's also a problem on MOS MUI4. 

so on MUI and boopsi picture datatype developers that use that begin to hack and use undocument features.
 
So i suggest that on AROS 68k same way is go as AFA do.the AROS MUI lib is name as zune.library. All AROS programs are compile to use zune.library on 68k. 

This allow you to get best compatibility by using MUI 68k and avoid that new features cant add in zune, it break some programs.

user can use as in AFA the zune promoter to tell a program that it should use zune.library instead of muimaster.library 

because AFA is since long time out, there can say, that only around 70-80% of MUI 68k programs work perfect on zune.   too does not like OO stuff, too hard to find problems, so i give up, to make zune more compatible since many years.

for the bgui on AROS stuff i have currently no other idea, as the Problem come from AROS input device. this i can not test on AFA.



===arosc library===

The librom.a library now has the old-style 'no %f/%g' printf family, arosc.library has the floating point stuff. So, if you want %f, use 'linklibs=&quot;arosc&quot;', and *not* linklibs=&quot;rom&quot;. It may be prudent to have the 'rom' version print out '???' or something if someone accidentally links with it and uses a '%f' format. 
Only Prefs for openurl.library needed %f. 

FYI: it is not allowed to link modules (libraries, devices, etc) with arosc.library - this is because arosc.library stores the context in calling task. 

&lt;pre&gt;
TASK [arosc.library context]
|
|
\ /
module
|
|
\ /
arosc.library
&lt;/pre&gt;

So when the task dies, context dies, but the module had it's memory allocated on that context. That's why modules need to be linked with librom.a (even if the are NOT it the ROM) and C lib functions missing in librom.a must be implemented directly in module (that's what I had to do with mesa.library for example). 

&quot;So, if you want %f, use 'linklibs=&quot;arosc&quot;', and *not* linklibs=&quot;rom&quot;&quot; does not apply to them. :) 
PS. The macro for building modules explicitly disables linking with arosc.library - this is on purpose (that's why Kalamatee got linker errors) 

What does RawDoFmt() under AOS print, then? Wasn't it something like just the '%' stripped, i.e. 'f'? 



===bgui library===

All bgui.library gadgets are visible (some have small alignment bugs) but they can't be selected or activated with a mouse. Keyboard shortcuts work (if gadget has a keyboard shortcut set) 

bgui.library demos and FileMaster 3 (&quot;for some reason&quot; this is one of my test cases...) has same BOOPSI problem. 

They are in normal non-pressed state. Also it is not just button gadgets, all bgui gadget types can't be selected with a mouse. 

Everything else works (more or less) except mouse selection. For example string gadget that is selected when window opens has cursor visible and even text editing works fine. 

Pressing a key that is shortcut for button gadget works and gadget's text label disappears (which is wrong, it should show pressed state) Keeping shortcut key pressed while pressing ESC cancels the press event and text label re-appears.

So there is at least two different problems with bgui gadgets:
* mouse selection.
* button gadget (maybe others, can't really test until mouse selection works) pressed state is rendered incorrectly.



I activate many AROS  functions and classes for test in AFA (that make problems with 68k code), but bgui addbuttons Testprogram( i use only for test) work ok.So seem no Problem in one of this AROS function. 

buttonclass gmhittest on AFA is same as on AROS and work with all. 

I also revert some compatibility enhancement of AFA code.bgui still work.
I test when i have time on AROS 68k.

what happen if they cant click, is there no press state show when you click in it ?

here you can see what problems are cause by some AROS functions in some programs.normally i have deactivate all this functions with known bugs. 

so if you get such a problem it help maybe to find what function cause this.

this is stable working AROS code with no known compatibility Bugs

===prefs===

WB3.1 Prefs/Palette apparently manually creates DrawInfo structure(s) causing crash in sysiclass_aros.c because it assumes valid dri_Screen. 

Preferences program does not crash anymore if I set dri_version = DRI_VERSION + 1 in openscreen.c and only allow &quot;new&quot; drawinfo versions in sysiclass_aros.c. 

Is this change ok or is it better to have some kind of &quot;extended drawinfo&quot; flag instead of changed version number? Unfortunately this will break backwards compatibility with old AROS programs. (I'll put this inside AROS_FLAVOUR_BINCOMPAT ifdef if there is no compatible solutions) 

Prefs/palette stops crashing and works except color chooser circle is completely black, first all colors are drawn and when it is finished, it is overwritten with black color. 

WB3.1 Prefs/Palette calls AreaCircle (or AreaEllipse) twice (this is used to draw the narrow black border around color wheel), both have same center coordinates, one has few pixels larger radius, and finally AreaEnd is called which should only fill narrow area border area. AROS version fills both circles, result is completely black color wheel. (I
am not going to touch this)

Apparently AreaEnd() always uses blitter-like area fill.




===wb===

AOS Workbench started programs also have NULL pr_CurrentDir.

For example very common SAS-C startup code (source comes with compiler) does following when started from WB:

&lt;pre&gt;
a0 = WB startup message
move.l     wa_Lock(a0),d1
callsys    DupLock
move.l     d0,__curdir(A4)
move.l     d0,d1
callsys    CurrentDir
&lt;/pre&gt;

Unfortunately at exit it does not restore pr_CurrentDir, it only Unlock()'s __curdir(a4). Which means there is no other way to handle this than to have NULL pr_CurrentDir. (Currently it causes double unlock which at least UAE fs ignores without crashes, not sure about others). I now have confirmed following Process variables when started from WB: 

&lt;pre&gt;
pr_CurrentDir = NULL
pr_HomeDir = set
pr_CIS = NULL
pr_COS = NULL
pr_ConsoleTask = NULL
pr_FileSystemTask = set
&lt;/pre&gt;




==commodities==

Debugging this and it is ScreenToFront(&quot;wb screen&quot;) that gets called by Wanderer (or something) after selecting Execute. I guess screendepth isn't checking (at least correctly) that requested screen is already in front. Call trace is: screendepth()-&gt;RethinkDisplay()-&gt;MrgCop()</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Number of Base Two==
Base two numbers only use the two digits 0 and 1 . Any number greater than 1 is represented by a series of 0 and 1 digits
:&lt;math&gt;1110 = 1 x 2^3 + 1 x 2^2 + 1 x 2^1 + 0 x 2^0&lt;/math&gt; = 14

Numbers that contain only two digit 0 and 1 are called Binary Numbers. Each 0 or 1 is called a Bit, from ''bi''nary ''di''git.  A binary number of 4 bits is called a Nibble. A binary number of 8 bits is called a Byte. A binary number of 16 bits is called a Word on some systems, on others a 32-bit number is called a Word while a 16-bit number is called a Halfword.

Using 2 bit 0 and 1 to form 
: a binary number of 1 bit, there are 2 such numbers 0 and 1
: a binary number of 2 bit, there are 4 such numbers 00, 01, 10, 11
: a binary number of 3 bit, there are 8 such numbers 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111 
: a binary number of 4 bit, there are 16 such numbers 0000, 0010, 0100, 0110, 1000, 1010, 1100, ..., 1111

''Therefore , using n bits there are 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; binary numbers of n bits''

==Numbers of Base Ten==
Base ten numbers use ten digits, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Any number greater than 9 is represented by a series of digits in the 0 through 9 range.
:&lt;math&gt;14 = 1 x 10^1 + 4 x 10^0 &lt;/math&gt;

==Communication (Conversion) between numbers of Different base==
The same number 14 expressed 
: in base ten is 14 
: in base two is 1110 . 

Hence , ''any number in our base ten system can be represented by a binary number of certain bit''

      <comment>/* Respect For Other Cultures */ Celeste talked about observational learning of respect and making mistakes</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Respect is a concept that is characterized or determined by feelings and actions. The feelings and actions that result in respectful behavior possess an important causal relationship. A sentiment of respect is dependent on another person or entity’s actions, while acting respectful is dependent on a person’s feelings, or what they perceive as respectful. The act of “being respectful,” however, is not so simple. The seemingly infinite number of cultural determinants (i.e. ethics and norms) makes “respect” a challenging goal to achieve. The cultural ethics and norms that embody each and every individual are magnified, and many times, conflicting when foreign cultures come in contact. In other words, varying perceptions of what is respectful and what is not produce unavoidable cultural disparities. Despite their unavoidability, these disparities can be bridged through observational learning and subsequent understanding of the ethics and norms that exemplify respect.  With that said, it is extremely important to learn what is considered to be respectful not only in another culture, but also among the people you travel with.

==Traveling with a Group==
Prior to arriving at a foreign destination, it is important to understand that the group you travel with is representative of the country you come from and the institution you are a part of. Each individual must also realize that his or her actions, whether beneficial or detrimental, impact the entire group. Therefore, in order for the group to emanate respect, it is essential that the individual keep the reputation of his or her group in mind. Many times, the group that the individual is traveling with will have set a series of guidelines that dictates group ideologies. It is important to attempt to adhere to the ideologies in order for the group to work together properly and in turn, show respect toward the foreign culture. Although it is important for group members to maintain the reputation of their group, being respectful of fellow group members is equally, if not more important. There will be occasions when group dynamics go awry. Rather than letting tensions between group members fester, it is important for the group to appoint a figure that is able to mediate group members’ problems in a sensitive and thoughtful manner. In order to avoid tensions between group members, it is also important to realize that personal sacrifices must be made for the benefit of the group as a whole. 
[[File:Drukstation.JPG|thumb|Drukstation]]

A strategy that can be used when traveling with a group is to create a set of guiding principles for the trip.  Before I traveled to Kenya with a group of 17 we sat down and made a list of all the important behaviors, attitudes, and actions everyone was expected to uphold while we were traveling. Half way through the trip we relooked at the guiding principles to remind us of the way to conduct to conduct ourselves with one another, on the ground and in different cultures. It is important that everyone is your group is on the same page about the expectations of the group and the group members.

It is also important, as a member of a group, to remember that people see the world through different lenses, and each individual will have reactions and interpretations of situations that may not correspond with one another.  This can serve as a challenge to a group because when each person believes themselves to be right, they can become unwilling to see another's view.  Their minds can become hard and closed off and learning becomes difficult.  When traveling in another culture, it is essential to maintain an open mind, as one is constantly faced with new and unusual perspectives, customs, and people.  But it is important to maintain the same open mind when working with the group you travel with.  Though, the group may come from similar backgrounds and a similar place, perspectives, customs, and people vary immensely within any dynamic group of human beings, even if that group is a closely knit family.  Learning the strengths and weaknesses of your group members can serve as a highly useful tool to assess the most effective ways your group can function as a team without stepping on each other's toes.  

These various lenses through which people see the world can also prove useful to look out for each other.  During our time in Kenya, there were fairly strict guidelines for our wardrobe.  Modesty was very important in the area we were staying in and if any of us were unsure of our outfit, we asked a team member what they thought, knowing that someone else may have a more objective interpretation.  On multiple occasions, outfits were changed because an outside eye was able to see that the dress choice did not quite fit the guidelines. We were also supposed to be very careful about putting our feet on the furniture, but many of us had a habit of pulling one foot up underneath us when we sat down.  I was guilty of this many times, but often was hardly aware that I had done it.  We decided to make a code-word to say whenever we saw someone with their feet on the furniture, so as to call them out gently. We needed each other's help to be able to properly respect the culture in which we were guests.

==Cultural Norms==
The common behavior patterns of certain groups are the result of deeply ingrained cultural norms. These norms are so deeply ingrained into the daily life of each individual that it is difficult to be aware of their existence. An individual’s unfamiliarity with his or her own cultural norms may result in challenging circumstances when visiting foreign cultures. Understanding one’s own cultural norms, however, is impossible without the acquisition of a secondary cultural perspective. In other words, it is impossible to discover differences between cultural norms without having at least some understanding of a foreign culture. Therefore, the concept of cultural norms is based purely on an individual’s unique perspective of the foreign culture relative to their own culture. For this reason, learning processes highlighted by research and first-hand interaction are the most efficient ways to understand cultural norms. Once a basic knowledge of a foreign culture’s norms is understood, it is possible for the traveler to act according to these norms. It is important for a traveler to act according to the norms of the culture he or she is visiting because it is considered respectful. It is important to note, however, that a traveler does not need to adopt the unique behavior patterns of a foreign culture. Rather, the traveler should base their actions on whether or not they conflict with cultural norms. If the actions are conflicting, the traveler must stop and think about how and why their actions are disrespectful. When traveling to a foreign country, cultural norms will undoubtedly clash. The result of these cultural clashes will be intense learning experiences that will ultimately help the traveler become a more respectful global citizen. 

Despite the fact that it is important to respect cultural norms, a traveler must question whether or not adhering to foreign cultural norms will compromise his or her own, equally important values. This task, however, is extremely difficult. For example, some cultures do not allow women to dress in a revealing way. Should a female traveler adhere to this norm while contradicting her value of women’s equality? Similar examples manifest in many cross-cultural encounters and there may not be any clear solution. It is the traveler’s responsibility to solve this moral dilemma. Therefore, at the risk of compromising one’s own beliefs, sometimes it is necessary to disrespect in order to gain respect.

In Kenya, it is a cultural norm to be closer, and to have a more tangible and touchy relationship with people. In the US, your personal bubble and personal space is usually of high importance to an individual. When one student in particular went to Kenya, she struggled at first when older men and really young girls came up to dance with her. People throughout the village would also come up to her and hold her hand. After getting acquainted with some of the culture after a couple short weeks, she became aware of how much closer Kenya's culture was when it came to personal space. She did not necessarily feel the need to adapt to this behavior, but she gained a respect for it and did not question people's intentions. It is important to be aware of cultural norms in a foreign country and respect their culture regardless of whether or not it crashes with one's own believes.

While experiencing a foreign culture it is important to respect the beliefs and norms that define it. During my time in Kenya, I was awed by the astonishing amount of generosity, compassion, and hospitality that defined Kenyan culture. As a visitor in Kenya, I initially accepted any manifestation of these cultural virtues in an attempt to be respectful. One evening I, along with another student, was invited into the house of a primary school teacher. The door creaked and swung precariously as we entered the home. When we entered, the only light that allowed us to see came from a single, dimly lit candle. We were told to sit down while the teacher began to rummage through a haphazardly assembled tower of kitchenware. Once she found the teakettle, she began preparing tea. As the milk boiled, the teacher was ecstatic and told us how happy she was that we were there. Her extraordinary kindness and compassion was puzzling because we were so recently introduced. I had never experienced anything like it. A few minutes passed and the tea was ready. She poured us some tea and placed a pile of fried bread on the table. I felt guilty accepting all that she had offered because I, the privileged American, took from an impoverished, single mother and gave nothing in return. I wondered whether or not I should decline what she had offered but came to the realization that our presence was what we gave in return. I am sure that she will remember that night for the rest of her life. I learned that material goods do not have to be reciprocally exchanged. Intangible gifts such as one’s presence are just as, if not more important than any material gift I could have given.

==Appropriate Dress==
'''What is the appropriate way to dress?'''
There is no simple answer to this question, because it varies so much. It Is important that when you travel abroad you take into consideration both where you are going and who you are going with. It is also important to research the dress and understand what is or isn't appropriate. There are several ways of doing this, by both trying to find people that have gone there and research online. If you are going with a particular group to study abroad, the leader of the program will notify you. This is very important because you do not want to disrespect their culture or make Americans look bad. Showing respect means that you dress up to the level of the place or people you are visiting, even if there is no formal dress code that is obvious. In some places the way people dress is a large part of both their culture and customs. There are many different ways of dressing, so it is important that you know, and understand what is socially acceptable. One example is Dress and behave conservatively. This is often the case in less developed countries. If you are traveling to a country where $100 represents a month's salary, it is simply a bad idea to flaunt your wealth. Wearing expensive clothing and jewelry makes you attractive to the local criminal and may make them feel less of themselves. Specific and in depth analysis and advice of dress code can be found at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code.

It's okay to let go of the way you dress when in another culture. You have to recognize that you are in a place that does not share your culture and social norms are different everywhere. We are also students coming from America, a place that is regarded to be the wealthiest place in the world. They already think we are all incredibly wealthy, we must be additionally mindful that what we wear is a testament to what we can afford.

At Ombogo Girls Academy the girls are required to wear a school uniform and keep their hair short. The girls like this uniformity because it promotes unity and puts all of them on the same playing field. In Kochia there is a lot of poverty and the type of clothes the girls wear to school is a way of displaying their family's financial status.

==Alcohol and Drugs==
[[File:Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) pills.JPG|thumb|Nexium (esomeprazole magnesium) pills]]

'''What do you do about alcohol and drugs while traveling?'''
Alcohol:This is a very serious issue for students traveling abroad. It is very important to follow the laws and regulations for every country you are visiting. Every year many students are arrested abroad for drug and alcohol use due to ignorance and lack of awareness. As far as alcohol goes, always avoid underage drinking. Many issues such as arrests, accidents, rape, and violent crimes occur due to excessive alcohol consumption. Driving under the influence and public drinking are are often considered criminal activity. Drinking at times is appropriate and  culturally acceptable you just need to use discretion. Binge drinking however, is not only dangerous, especially in an unfamiliar setting, but also sets a poor example of one's country to the rest of the world.  With intoxication tends to come an increase in volume and a decrease in inhibition, composure, and awareness of one's surroundings.  While it may be new and exciting (especially for high school and college students) to have access to alcohol in a foreign country, it is essential that drinking in moderation in order to maintain a positive reputation of the country one represents.  

Drugs: 
Drug charges can carry severe consequences, including being jailed up to a year without the opportunity for bail, or the case is tried. Some crimes in some places are punished by physical abuse, fines, jail time, years of hard labor and sometimes even death. Not just drug possession, but like in the U.S contraband and paraphernalia can also get you in trouble. 
One of the problems with drugs is that people take have prescription medication that they need to take. Make sure that the mediation you are taking is not an illegal narcotic because that could be a very significant charge if you are caught. It is important that you always carry a letter from a health care professional explaining your condition and your need for medication. Any medications that you carry overseas should be in the original container, showing that a doctor prescribed it. Check with the foreign countries embassy to double check the medications are not considered an illegal narcotic. There is a listing of these on the Department of states website. http://www.state.gov/

==The Camera==

[[File:Cameras.jpg|thumb|Cameras]]



'''1. Cameras &amp; Taking respectful pictures'''
&lt;/u&gt;
Taking pictures:&lt;/u&gt;
	-be respecful and careful with flashes and pay attention to when you are taking a picture with a flash and if it could be respectful or disrespectful
	-Check your intentions for taking pictures first.
	-Ask yourself these questions: Why am I taking this picture? For what purpose will I use this picture for after I return home (for good or bad)? What is this picture saying about the people or images in it? Does it tell a story &amp; will I explain/	understand/honor &amp; respect that story?
	-Get permission from traveling partners to take pictures of them as well before taking a picture.
	-If you use the pictures from your trip for any publishing or for purposes of showing others outside of the travel group make sure that the people in those 	images are okay with that and respected. http://www.netplaces.com/photography/photographing-events/why-are-you-here.htm

Throughout my past experiences abroad, I never thought about how photography could bring about negative consequences for both the photographer as well as the subject. In short, I was careless when it came to taking pictures. Prior to my trip to Kenya, I was told about the consequences of careless and excessive camera use. More specifically, I was told about the importance of asking permission to take a subject’s photograph. In addition, I looked back on my past experiences and became conscious of the fact that constantly looking through the lens of a camera detracts from the overall experience. My enlightened perspective on photography instigated a new set of guidelines that I would utilize throughout my time in Kenya. The primary rule that I followed was to ask permission to take photographs. I also made a conscious effort to minimize my camera use in order to maximize my experience. Although I did not return from Kenya with thousands of photographs, I do not regret making these changes in my camera use because my experience in Kenya was enhanced. 
	
'''2. Camera Safety''' 
&lt;u&gt;
	 Cameras &amp; other Valuable belongings&lt;/u&gt;
	-keep with you at all times if it is an item you value. sometimes in rural parts of countries that you may travel to expensive technology is not afforded so you 	could be subject to theft (this could however happen anywhere). Keep valuable belongings in a place that your trust or on your person. 
	-Depending on the weather some technology may not be good exposed in rain, hail, snow if left laying around damage could be done. 

'''Appropriate Environments'''

	&lt;/u&gt; 
Is it a good time or place for a picture?&lt;/u&gt;
	-Some times there will be certain environments that are okay and appropriate to take pictures at and other times there won’t be.
	-It is best to ask someone who is in charge or a guide if the environment is an 	appropriate place to take a picture so you don’t offend people. 
	-Also, it is important to make sure you don’t have on your flash of your camera if you are in a place taking a picture that may disturb the people or natural vibe of 	the environment. 
	-FOR EXAMPLE: If someone took a picture in a place of worship depending on the geographical location, many places in the world, this could be seen as a sign of disrespect. If someone is praying or doing a religious ritual and your camera 	flashes this could distract from the ceremony. 
	-There will be times when you are challenged about taking a picture and you may have to use your gut instinct about whether or not it is appropriate to take a picture FOR EXAMPLE: if you are invited by guides and peoples of authority to 	take pictures of and or watch a child delivery but the woman who is giving birth has not been asked for permission is that considered appropriate? Some might argue, yes because we were invited and given permission by the authorities. Others would argue no because the women with less power has not been asked 	and is there for being disrespected, not honored, or given privacy and a chance to voice her opinion. http://www.ehow.com/how_13136_respectfully-photographs-traveling.html

'''The Camera and Relationships'''&lt;br /&gt;

It is important to consider how the camera will play into the developments of relationships. When visiting a region that does not have great access to technology, the camera can be a great sign of wealth and potentially be equated with a higher status, therefore creating a gap between the locals and yourself. By using the camera carelessly, it could potentially impact the relationships you strive to build by creating an image of the advantaged, white traveler. During my time in Kochia, Kenya, I found that it was best to only use my camera to take pictures of individuals with whom I had become close with. Having already established deep and mutually beneficial relationships, it felt more natural to be using my camera in those situations. I found that by pulling out my camera among people I did not know as well, particularly youth, the attention immediately became focused on the technology and really detracted from the personal interactions. When we did use our camera, some kids would become so exciting and enthralled with the device that it completely took away from our exange with them. We became &quot;the mzungus (or foreigners) with cameras.&quot; From these instances, I found that taking images should be a way to capture a pre-existing relationship for the sake of remembering the individuals and special moments.  

Another helpful tip to remember is that it is never to late to put your camera away and set limits on photo taking.  It can become overwhelming in situations where everyone is crowding around to be in the next shot or to see the previous one.  It feels like if you take the camera away, people will bother you until you bring it back out. This is not the case, and putting limits on the situation can save the relationships.  While in Kenya, some of the female students on our team got the chance to have a sleepover in the dorms at Ombogo Girls Academy with the girls we had been spending time with.  I took my camera, but forgot the amount of attention it would get when I pulled it out.  The girls and I had a great time taking &quot;snaps&quot; of each other and posing for the camera, but after about ten minutes, I started feeling like the camera was taking over. ''It'' was the good time we were having together. So I called out, &quot;Two more pictures,&quot; and when those two were taken, I put it away.  No one complained or stopped having a good time, we just found other things to do together.

==Displays of Materialism &amp; &quot;Wealth&quot;==

-Avoid displaying unnecessary items of value (ex: jewelry, ipod...) Don't show off items of technology. You never know what the people around have been exposed to. This could also put a rift between the relationships you are trying to form.

-Be careful about the things that you say that could be hurtful to others.

-If offered food don't say that it's nasty or be rude. This is seen as a high disrespect in many parts of the world where food is a luxury and basic needs are not met. 

-Please be mindful of wasting whether it be food, water, material items, etc.

-You may visit areas that are more rural than you are used to experiencing. Take these opportunities to learn rather than judge and make assumptions. 

-Research the etiquette and customs of the country you are traveling to. The last thing you want to do is offend, disrespect, or unknowingly break a law.

-Engage in the environment around you by getting out of your comfort zone. Even if things are unfamiliar to you. EXAMPLE: Doing laundry in a river with host family or walking the streets of a market place.

-Live as though you live amongst the people. Blend. You don't want to create a sense of elitism. 

-Practice &amp; learn giving more than you take. 

-Be flexible with the unexpected and open minded towards the new and unknown.

-Sacrifice personal needs for others &amp; group

-Consider the source and sustainability of products you buy/use.

-Bargain fairly and realize that the value of money is different for those with less of it.

-Give/buy gifts that help not hurt. 

-Be modest and not too flashy in attire (dress). '''Refer to &quot;Appropriate Dress&quot;'''

- Help each other learn how we can make more conscious and responsible decisions.

- Leave all places that we visit better than we found them.

==Respect For Other Cultures==

There is a need for a deeper level of respect when traveling to foreign places. Respect for the country and its resources, as well as, respect for the people and their culture. People have different ways to demonstrate respect depending on the country and culture. You must become aware of what is and is not tolerated in the foreign country. It is common for a person to remain wrapped up in their own beliefs and opinions while traveling abroad, which makes it challenging to accept other peoples’ way of life and customs. Close mindedness and bigotry is not the way to go and can be detrimental to your experience and respect for the other culture while abroad. It is important to respect other cultures because there is so much we can learn about other rituals and beliefs. Learning to accept and respect them is a vital step that opens your mind and makes you aware of the world around you and all the unique people in it.

Observing what it means to respect another culture can be quite challenging.  You may not speak the language to be able to ask about customs or what is appropriate. And even if you do know the language, or they know yours, a straight answer may not be given to your question.  Pay attention to the people around you.  What do you notice about the interactions between men and women? How are people dressed? What is and is not done in public that you might be used to? How does the history of the country or area affect their lifestyle? What bothers you about the way other foreigners behave? Thinking and observing the people around you with questions like these in mind will likely land you the most helpful answers.  Having a travel guide from the area you are in can also be extremely helpful in learning to respect the culture.  Don't be afraid to ask about things if you are unsure, but also understand that the answer to your questions may not be the whole truth.  If for example, the people you are staying with are doing everything they can to accommodate your comfort, they may give you the answer that they believe is what ''you'' want, even if it is not the culturally appropriate truth.  

Finally, know that you will make mistakes, and that you are not alone in making them.  Everyone who travels has to learn what it means to respect their surroundings, and it takes time and almost always includes accidental offenses.  In these situations, you do not need to spend five minutes explaining yourself, but rather do your best to apologize, remember what happened and make sure that you avoid the same mistake in the future.  Learning outside of a textbook requires risks.

===Developing Relationships===
The key to developing meaningful relationships while abroad, like while at home, is honesty and genuineness. Although cultural barriers and language barriers are more or less inevitable, demonstrating authentic interest in and respect for the people and cultures you encounter goes a long way. Most of the time, people recognize that you are in an unfamiliar setting and will therefore be patient and understanding. Nonetheless it is essential to &quot;meet people halfway&quot; - doing everything you can to be prepared, understand your setting, and keep an open mind. When uncertain of something, the best protocol is always simply to ask. It is normal to feel unsure of ourselves when we are outside of our comfort zone, and people are receptive to that. It is when we fail to communicate that misunderstandings occur and problems can arise. Furthermore, many people are enthusiastic about sharing their lives and cultures with newcomers and will embrace the opportunity to teach. 

[[File:Languages world map-transparent background.svg|thumb|Map demonstrating linguistic diversity. Each color represents not one language, but an entire language family, which can include dozens or even hundreds of distinct languages. For a key see &lt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Languages_world_map.svg&gt;]]
Clear communication can be challenging when two parties do not share fluency in a common language. If given the opportunity, and especially when staying abroad for an extended period of time, it is usually best to make an effort to learn and speak the language. Although some people will be enthusiastic about speaking or practicing English, it is extremely inappropriate to assume that this is the case when on another person's &quot;turf&quot;. The expectation to be able to successfully get through life knowing only English is a reflection of privilege - native English speakers have the benefit of their own language being the dominant one. This is especially touchy when we consider that thousands of languages are being lost in the face of globalization- every 14 days a language dies. The assumption that everyone should and does learn English both demonstrates and fosters the ideological perspective of western capitalist supremacy.

The last key to developing friendships is to understand roles and norms and therefore behave in an appropriate and respective manner. Research and ask questions about social norms before leaving. Consider the norms that influence your own life; small things like speaking distance or appropriate greetings can turn out to be a major shock. As with all things, before going reflect and research. For more info on this see [[International Service Learning Study Abroad Handbook/Respect|here]].

===Power and Equity===

When entering a new culture and new way of life, it is important to understand that you do not know as much as you think you do. The people here know the culture and know the history of themselves. Because of this, it is entirely inappropriate for you to try and decide what people want or need, because you have not lived in this place. The best way to put yourself on equal ground with the local people is to create a joint learning environment. This also ensures that there is less of a power differential. 

To make the most out of your trip, it is important for members of both parties to learn from each other. Rather than coming in and trying to fix problems you do not know about, it is better to ask what the local people think and what they want. The locals like their life, and do not need to be told what is wrong with them, etc. Instead, learn from them and find out what they actually want from you before you try to help. If you try to help without talking to them first, you will end up in a lot of trouble. Not only will you not accomplish anything, but you may actually harm the locals, plus you will also taint the relationships being made. If you try to fix something from the start, you are going to be putting yourself into a role that makes it seem like you are better than them, rather than standing on equal ground. 

It is also important to consider the differences between access to resources or technology. While visiting somewhere, you can change your relationship with the local people in an instant by introducing technology into the scene. For example, if you are carrying a camera around everywhere, you may come off seeming like you are showing off your wealth. It is possible that the camera you are holding is worth more than the local people make in a week, and by showing it off you are putting yourself in a clear empowered role. You may have built fantastic relationships with the local people, but as soon as your pull out this camera, that can become the only thing they care about suddenly. By showing off technology, you are making them feel as if their lives are inadequate. Suddenly they are unhappy with the lives that have been working perfectly for them up until they saw the camera.

A good source to look at that talks about this power struggle are these videos:
http://www.vimeo.com/20905770
http://www.vimeo.com/20900679

When visiting another country as a tourist, especially as a tourist to a developing world, you might have privileges and power outside of technology or material things. Visiting a hospital and touring patients rooms, going to a bar, or sitting in on classes are all privileges that locals don't have or that we wouldn't have in our home country. While you might be shown confidential records or ask what you want to see, you don't have to agree and it is perfectly alright to say no. It is important to recognize this and set limits on what is appropriate and respectful towards everyone. If something doesn't feel right or is something you wouldn't feel comfortable doing at home, don't do it. It is important to develop equal relationships and recognize when you are getting experiences that are outside your comfort zone or uncomfortable for others.

===Sustaining Relationships===

Sustaining relationships after departing from the foreign country comes with its own unique challenges. Depending on the circumstances, it might be very difficult to keep in contact with new friends after leaving. However, it is possible to maintain a positive relationship even when miles apart.
Actions taken to sustaining a relationship should occur before departure. Look into the types of technology available and think about the best way of communication possible.  Depending on the country, options might range from full internet access to snail mail. If internet communication is possible, there are many free services to make communication easy, including Skype, social networking sites, blog sites, and photo sharing sites. 

During the trip, it is important to maintain good relationships so there are actually relationships to sustain in the future. Being open, honest, and respectful will help immensely as you meet people. Also keep in mind that all people should be treated with dignity and respect. 

Other things to be mindful about is recording addresses, phone numbers, first and last names, and anything else that might be useful in order to maintain contact. This information might be easy to forget while living abroad, but after departure, it would be very difficult to be able to reconnect. Taking a notebook and pen wherever you go would help solve this problem.

It is also important to be respectful and honest with yourself and your new friends. Don’t promise to keep in touch if you don’t intend to and be true to your word if you promise to send photographs, etc. Not doing so would be more harmful to any future relationship and might bar you from positive opportunities in the future. Being honest and open will open the door for further communication that is healthy and fair for everyone involved.

Here is a what a girl who went to Kenya says about the relationships with the people she had met in Kenya,
&quot;Though we didn’t literally climb Mt. Kilimanjaro, I feel like we have all climbed so many other mountains on this trip.
I may not have done the job of building infrastructure for the roads, or houses for families, but I have learned, taken away, and gained more than I could ever imagine. I have learned the meaning of care. I have received and been immersed in the sweetest love and joy for the last six weeks from the relationships I have built. The things I really want to express to people back home are less about what I did, less about what this experience was like, but much more about what I learned the people I met. I told myself one of the first things I am going to do is bake cookies for all of my new neighbors and go meet them right away. After all, we only live one door down.
I have spent this time with the most incredible people and am blessed to be a part of such an amazing group back home. I have met people with such big hearts that sometimes I think they simply could explode. It will be nice to lay my head down back at home and know that there are the same incredible people half way around the world.  I have realized that in the US we have the ability to completely focus on our own needs and happiness and we don’t focus enough on the group and human kind as a whole. Kenyan’s have given me a new perspective. Not one person in this community puts themselves first. Instead of focusing on how they as one singular person in the world can remain with the highest potential of happiness, they strive to figure out how they can spread joy, and possibly share their meal with a neighbor, even if it takes them having much less. If they only watched out for their own personal needs, happiness and growth, these amazing communities would not be anywhere. I have come away from this trip with better friends then I have ever made before.&quot;

The relationships with local people that you are involved in while abroad are powerful. For me, initiating and nurturing the relationships was not difficult while I was in country. It was the “coming home” part that I had trouble with. When I was home, I found it challenging to maintain the same deep friendships with the community members that I had while I was abroad. Once I got back to my busy life in the United States, the numerous phone calls and Facebook messages that I received from the girls became more of a hassle than leisure. It was hard to incorporate my life abroad with my life at home. I do not have the same freedom with time that I did when I was in Africa. The time difference and conflicts in schedules made it difficult to give the attention to the friendships that they deserved. Coming up with time frames and plans to talk on the phone with one another made it easier to maintain relationships because it allowed me to have specific times a week when nothing else was on my mind except for catching up with old friends and hearing stories of all the activities that they are involved in. The relationships you make with people while you are abroad and then continuing to develop them once you are home is what makes traveling to any country an ‘experience of a life time’.

===Confidentiality===
There are many aspects to confidentiality to consider when studying abroad. The first is the issue of confidentiality of students whom who are travelling with. Since you will be living in very close quarters, most likely you will learn more about your fellow students than you would in a class. In addition, for the sake of travel safety, you might know about a student’s medication, allergies, habits, etc. However,  it is important to not share this with other group members, friends, and family when you come back home. There may be things students wish to keep in their private life, but when travelling, are unable to do so. Please be respectful and courteous when it comes to this information. 

In addition, living in such close conditions for weeks or months will create more open relationships. Students might feel comfortable sharing their secrets and feelings with you more than they would have normally, because of these shared experiences. It is a privilege to be able to share these experiences and emotions with each other, but it is also your responsibility to keep these private unless given permission to share.  Think about what you would be comfortable with and trust your gut instinct. If it feels weird or strange to share something so personal, don’t do it. You can also always ask if you may share their story. 

Outside of your group, you will also be creating new relationships and making new friends during your travels abroad. In addition to opening up to them about your life, they also might open up to you and share their stories. You might be tempted to run back and share with your group members or when you get home. However, please be courteous and ask permission first or hold your silence. It is a great opportunity to be able to share stories with someone from another culture, but take a step back and think before you share. The person sharing the story is a person and not just an experience for you or a story for you to tell. Always think before acting.

After speaking with a counselor at the Ombogo Girls’ Academy in Kenya, I realized just how important confidentiality is in Kochia, both in the village and at school. As a counselor, she helps students see different options and the benefits and costs of pursuing each one. As a community stricken by AIDS, many people do not seek treatment or tell anyone of their status because they are worried that it could be passed around. Therefore, people are also reluctant to seek professional help because they are worried about confidentiality issues. Upon visiting the school, many girls would confide in me because they knew I was a safe source who was a dead-end as far as gossip goes. It is important to maintain their confidence but also to encourage them to go to an adult or another person they trust who can support them if they are having a difficult time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Have you ever done community service work, or traveled to another location to help someone in need that you did not personally know? Human beings are one of the few species that have altruistic tendencies. Why do people feel the need impact other people's lives? In this section we will discuss the differences between helping and service, ask you to think about the reasons for doing service work, how the length of time you serve is very important, and discuss respectful ways of giving and receiving gifts.

==Helping, Fixing or Serving==
“Helping, fixing and serving represent three different ways of seeing life. When you help, you see life as weak. When you fix, you see life as broken. When you serve, you see life as whole. Fixing and helping may be the work of the ego, and service the work of the soul.”
- Rachel Naomi Remen

[[File:Handshake stylised.png|thumb|Handshake stylised]]

Often those setting out on a service learning or volunteer project think in terms of helping or fixing. This comes from a good place, a place in us that sees hardship and people less privileged than us and wants to do something about it. However, when it is framed in the terms of helping or fixing there is an implication that those you are “helping” are incapable of helping themselves or that they do not know how to “fix” their own problems. This creates, from the get go, a power difference between you and those you will be working with. This inequality will make it harder to work with people and harder to get to know them. 

To be able to build the strong and meaningful relationships that everyone hopes to cultivate on this kind of experience, it is important to think of the people you will be working with as equals and to LISTEN. That is where serving comes in. Here is a test: when you get to your service learning location ask the people in the community where they see the problem areas to be. And then ask them what they think the solutions should be. Often the answers will surprise you. The people in the community have amazing ideas about how to improve their community. They have insights into solutions that, as outsiders, we will never have. This listening exercise can bring up some interesting questions about the work you and other are doing in the community.

Many organizations and NGOs that do service or volunteer projects have realized just this, that communities know best. These are the kinds of service projects where building strong relationships and trust with the community is important. The people that work and volunteer with these groups see themselves as doing service work rather than fixing the problems of a less privileged community. The projects that come from these groups are most likely to be sustained and to have an impact because the ideas and passion comes from the community, not outsiders. 

While we spent time in Kochia, Kenya, one experience I had truly struck me, and hit me that I wasn't in Kenya to save it, and even if I was, I wouldn't be able to. Through our work at Ombogo Girls Academy and Abba Primary School and CBO, one day was spent doing a partnership project between the two groups. At Ombogo, we split into groups, and each of us from America was assigned a group of students from Ombogo to work with. We teamed up with Abba CBO to go out into the community of Kochia and help in the homes of the grandmothers for a day. We were asked to help clean their homes, do their laundry, and get some order back into the houses. For a long time, I was very frustrated with this day. I couldn't speak the language, and needed the girls to interpret for me, I didn't know how to wash clothes by hand, and for the most part, just stood there while the girls did it, and I didn't know what was expected from the process of cleaning a house in Kenya. As much as I was glad that the grandmothers were helped out that day, I felt like it was silly for me to have been there, because all I did was stand there. I felt like the one time we were finally going to go &quot;do&quot; something, I just stood there. I was worried that the girls would be annoyed with me because I wasn't helping at all, and I genuinely wanted to be able to say that I had something tangible to show for my time there. 
It wasn't until we returned home and that day continued to stick with me that it really started to sink in. I had a hard time ever placing my finger on why that day had stuck with me or ever knowing specifically what bothered me about it. That is when I realized that I'm not in Kenya to fix things. Everyone there is capable of running their own lives, and nobody can simply walk in and fix a problem and leave. If I was to ever be able to help people there, I would have had to have spent much more time in Kochia and learned the culture, language, and village much more. I cannot help anyone without building a relationship with them first. These girls from Ombogo on the other hand, knew everything that needed to be done. They wasted no time, and carried with themselves so much compassion for their country and community, it was incredible. 

It is important to know a lot about the group or organization you will be doing your service learning with. Always question an organizations commitment to serving over fixing a community.

Since I have traveled to Kenya, and spent time studying the ethics of serving and the ethics of coming into a foreign location with the intention of fixing anything, I have become very interested in researching the ethics of various organizations. I was very interested in the recent trend of TOMS shoes, and whether their outer image of saving the world was really doing good or not. I have debated for awhile now whether or not I should buy a pair of shoes, and if they really are accomplishing anything. Before buying a pair, I took the time to really research the company and read both the company website's description of their program, and critics reviews of the company. What I found really backed up many things that I saw while on the ground in Kenya. While we all want the world to have shoes, and really love the idea of giving away shoes, or toys, or soccer balls to underprivileged children in developing nations, the question arises of why these shoes, toys, or soccer balls cannot be bought in the developing nation. TOMS shoes goes into developing nations and gives away hundreds of thousands of pairs of shoes each year. However, by doing this, local economies are being harmed. Local vendors that are selling shoes are losing business, because potential buyers are instead being given shoes. Because of this, higher unemployment rates ensue, further perpetuating the poverty in the country.

At the same time, TOMS lets volunteers buy their way to developing nations to go pass out the shoes. By doing this, they are allowing people to exploit the people in these developing nations, by helping out the idea of poverty tourism. These volunteers then take all of the shoes to give away, and go personally pass them out. Throughout developing nations, there is a huge stereotype that the white man is there to save the day, and will always bring gifts. Instead of building lasting relationships, local people instead see white people only as sources of money and gifts. While in Kenya, one small girl walked up to me one day and tapped my arm. I was expecting she wanted to hold my hand and hang out with me for awhile, but instead she sternly looked at me and simply said &quot;Where's my present?&quot; I was caught off guard, and told her I didn't have a present for her. At that, she promptly walked away from me and I never saw her again. She was so used to simply expecting gifts from white travelers that she had no interest in actually building a relationship with me. 

By taking the time to research TOMS shoes, I was able to make a responsible consumer decision, and decide if their product was really right for me. This carries over to other retailers, non-profits, or volunteer agencies. It is incredibly important to know where your money is going to, and know if you donate money if it is actually doing any good.

==Who is it for?==

“The people we are visiting have just as much—if not more—to teach us as we have to teach them.” –Daniela Papi

Although the answer may seem obvious, the question of whom service learning is benefiting is not as clear as it may seem. The people possibly benefiting are the people being visited, the families in the community being visited, the nation as a whole, the sponsors or fundraisers of the volunteer, the organization the volunteer is going through, or possibly the volunteer herself.  And as much as the volunteer might offer their service in the belief that the community needs them, perhaps there’s more to the issue; perhaps the volunteer actually needs what the community offers just as much, or even more.

Service volunteer Matthew Stokes is a great example of this.  Matthew went for a short period of time to Costa Rica, where he brought a collection of donations for a small community as well as money to help them build an orphanage.  However, Matthew’s idea of using the two-week time frame he was given in order to contribute to a community began to change form once he arrived and submerged himself in the culture.  One thing he discovered was that the community felt his visit was about getting to know each other, and that building relationships was much more important than building a physical structure and getting the most work out of every hour. 

Through this experience, Matthew began to question the overall goal of the trip, eventually realizing that “service learning occurs only when both the providers and recipients of service benefit from the activities” (Furco, 1996).  Also, clearly people have different ideas about what the goal of a service trip is, and learning to listen and adjust is what might distinguish “fixing” or “helping” from true service. [everyone]

Any time a volunteer is communicating with someone—whether initially they are serving or not—the volunteer is expanding themself through the experiences they’re involved in.

Here is what one student said about her time in Kenya and the gifts she has brought back home with her.

&quot;I have spent this time with the most incredible people and am blessed to be a part of such an amazing group back home. I have met people with such big hearts that sometimes I think they simply could explode. They have opened their hearts to me and given me so many kind words. I may not have climbed mount Kilimanjaro, but I feel like I have climbed so many other mountains. It will be nice to lay my head down back at home and know that there are the same incredible people half way around the world.

I have realized that here we have the ability to completely focus on our own needs and happiness and we don’t focus enough on the group and human kind as a whole. Kenyan’s have given me a new perspective. Not one person in this community puts themselves first. Instead of focusing on how they as one singular person in the world can remain with the highest potential of happiness, they strive to figure out how they can spread joy, and possibly share their meal with a neighbor, even if it takes them having much less. If they only watched out for their own personal needs, happiness and growth, these amazing communities would not be anywhere. Though the children receive one cup of porridge a day, they are living more fully than many children I see at home and have given me so much joy. They see beauty in so little. 

I don’t want to put the safari and the relationships I have built on the same level. I don’t know much about Africa, and all I have is a small pair of eyes in which I have been able to see through. I have seen two small places in a small country in Africa, and will struggle speaking for the rest of the continent. I am a bit nervous that talking about the trip will not do justice to my experiences. But I promised all of the girl’s at Ombogo that the first thing I would do for them is greet my friends and family with love from them, for they have offered and given me so much. 

I came on this trip with the impression that I was going to be different. My skin was different, my language was different, my life back home was different. I was prepared to be an outsider. This idea got blown completely out of the water. The relationships I have built in these six short weeks have been amazing and I wish to do my best and share them with you all. The first letter I got from Beryl ended with this quote, “Your companionship has made me to know that human beings all have the same races. We are all human kind. Quality of a good friend is anywhere.”

In Kenya, when a family gets a goat, they cut the meat of it’s neck, cook it, and put it outside for passer byers in the community. People may look poor on the outside, but inside they are so incredibly rich.

It has been a huge success for me to be here and witness the growth everyone has had in such a short time. Everything in this world comes down to building relationships, love, and joy. I have promised myself to remain a true friend, to love freely, to constantly support my family and to grow stronger with each accomplishment, and even stronger with each setback. I will constantly give, and honor my own experiences and stories. I will remain grateful and realize my own privileges. I will realize the power and potential of personal growth. This trip has been completely about giving and receiving love and it radiates outward.

==Short term vs. Long term==
When you are on a service learning trip does it matter how long you stay? In the above sections we learned that it is okay to travel to a location to explore new culture, to learn through experience, to make relationships with people different from you. In service learning you have to acknowledge that you are traveling to improve the place you are going and to better yourself. This is the first step in understanding service learning. The next thing that a traveler must take into consideration is how long their trip is going to be. The longer you are there the easier it will be to make connections with people and start learning about the ways you can help their community that will be most beneficial for them. 

In high school I went on four service learning trips through my youth group. Three of them were in country mission trips and one was out of the country. Each trip was about seven to ten days long. While I was at all of these individual places the team I was with accomplished a great amount and we learned a lot about different cultures, team work and ourselves. One crucial aspect of service learning that was missing from those trips was building lasting relationships. When thinking back, if we had gone back to the same place every year for two or three weeks, think how much more of an impact we could have made rather than spending one week at four different sites. 

The longer you can stay at a given location and the more opportunities you have to return will make your service more beneficial for you and the community you serve. It allows you to build strong relationships that make you personally connected to the culture, people and place you are visiting. It also gives the people you are serving a greater chance to learn and understand the culture that you come from. 

An interview with Pennye Nixon from Etta Projects, a non-profit organization based out of Montero, Bolivia helps to explain the some issues in the service world. There work work is to “facilitate and help communities find the pathways to sustainable and realistic answers to have those needs met.” Pennye describes the difference between helping and service with the example of building a well. Building a well where there is a need for clean water and then leaving is helping.  Questions need to be addressed such as, how to use the well, who to go to when there needs to be repairs when you are gone, how to keep the well from contamination. When these issues are addressed and worked through, this is service. Helping is bringing the product but service is teaching how to sustainably use the product. 
 
Another thing that Pennye talked about was the importance of long-term service. Etta Projects work on projects for a minimum of three years. One of the most important things is building relationships and creating strong sustainable projects that will last once your influence has left. It takes a very long time to build trusting relationships with community members but it is possible to do when viewing your service as long-term. She also explained that you are not going to end poverty by completing your project, but when you are done the people you are serving will have a different, healthier way of life. Sustainability is key to service. Anyone can start a project, what you want is once you leave and come back 15 years later the work did is still there and doing the job you created. 

Thank you Pennye Nixon for all of your great input.

==Giving and Receiving==
Have you considered giving or receiving gifts while you are traveling? Are there negative consequences for exchanging gifts? If someone offers you a present should you accept?  Many people when traveling abroad will bring extra clothes or supplies to the people they are serving. This seems like a logical and resourceful thing to do but when you look at the broader picture it can be hurtful to the relationships you are creating. By giving impoverished individuals who you are trying to build relationships with your old items it creates a power differentiation. It is sending the message that you are better than them; they can have your old things you do not need anymore because you can buy new items. It is also sending the message that what they have is not good enough or up to Western standards.

I have just gotten back from a six week Service learning trip in Kochia, Kenya with about 11 other university students. We talked a lot about giving and receiving before we left but I did not fully understand how much issues around giving and receiving came up while I was in Kenya. The whole time we were there we were considered the “visitors” that got special treatment.  Every place we went we were invited in to have tea or ugi, which is porridge made out of millet, everywhere we went. I remember our first visit to the ABBA International School of Excellence, a primary school, orphanage, and health clinic. After we got a tour of the facility they sat us down in the kitchen area and served us this huge class of ugi without asking if we would like any. We were sitting with about 40 orphans as well eating the porridge. Some of the children sitting all around me were malnutrition, I felt so guilty I did not want to accept the ugi, I wanted to give my cup to one of the kids. I felt so uncomfortable taking food that these children could be eating when I knew I had a full dinner later that night. 
This type of thing happened a lot while we were in Kenya always being pampered and treated with the best care. Over time I learned that in those situations it would be disrespectful to reject the tea or food someone is offering you. It was still uncomfortable sometimes but if us sitting down having ugi with the people we met in Kenya than that’s what we will do. 

There are many aspects of giving and receiving. Another one is bringing gifts. When we traveled to Kenya we did not bring soccer balls, toothbrushes, and clothes for the people. That was not what the trip was about. It was about building relationships learning and experiencing and different culture. At first this was really hard to remember for me when we first arrived. I saw how little everyone had and struggles with how much I had. I was frustrated that we didn’t bring anything. Overtime I realized that if we had showed up and dumped a bunch of stuff onto these people it would have completely ruined the relationship. It would have looked like that was our only reason for being there. Whenever white people come to Africa they bring stuff, we broke this stereotype because we were not there to tell them there life will be better with the materials we bring. The lives of the people there may not be full of things and stuff, but they are full of love, happiness, joy and faith. The relationships and the things we learned about one another will last a lifetime, much after a soccer ball will be popped. 
  
The last thing I learned about giving and receiving is it is okay to say no when someone asks you for something.  I got asked for my watch, water bottle and ring I was wearing multiple times. A boy came up to me at ABBA and grabbed my watch and said “Give me this.” I said “I can’t I need it for the rest of the trip.” He replied, “But you can buy another one.” That sentence shocked me, he was completely right I could buy another one but I still needed my watch and I didn’t have a watch for all 350 students at the school so I did not give it. When things come up like this it is difficult but I learned it is okay to say no when you need to. 

Gift giving is in many aspects of the American culture. Gifts are given to say thank you, to celebrate a special occasion and numerous other times. This is not true for all other places and cultures around the world. When you are traveling gift giving is not always expected. If you do feel the need to give gifts, keep them for people that have made a special impact on you while you were traveling. 
It is best when giving and receiving gifts to give something that you made, as it is more personal than something you purchased. Examples would be bracelets, pictures, or something from the heart. This will instill equality and a true friendship rather than giving charity. 

We also spend a lot of time at the Ombogo Girls Academy, a secondary boarding school for girls. On our last day we printed out pictures of some of the students we became friends with and wrote a note on the back. Many girls also wrote us goodbye letters. These letters meant so much to me and I will have them forever.

“Give gifts that help, not hurt; think about the impact of what and how you give. Give more than we take by learning from and teaching the people we encounter”- Jill Hecherthorn

Leading into the trip, I was cautious not to give things away, seeing that I didn't want to favor anybody, or contribute to dependency.  And, although I was asked many times to give away some of my belongings, another question arose that I thought was slightly, but distinctly different.  Parked in the middle of a street during protests, street vendors came to the window offering many things I did not want to buy.  Yet one of them asked, &quot;If I give you something, will you give me something in return?&quot;  I found this question to come up a lot.  Looking through my bag, I had only expensive gear that I needed for the trip.  Throughout the trip I found an important difference between giving gifts and giving something for people to remember you by.  After handing out probably over 20 drawings, I wish I'd had a more simple and small things to represent who I am and where I come from.  Pictures of family, symbols of home, or a favorite book would have been helpful to share a part of home with my friends away from home.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Before leaving for your service-learning or study abroad trip, it is really imperative that you consider the many effects visiting another culture might have on your identity. How might your identity be viewed within the context of another country? How might your identity need to adapt in order to comply with the social norms of the society? If a country you visit has a very different set of values, your role within that society could very well differ from the role you fulfill in your home. As a result, gender, religion, race, and sexuality may all be challenged within a new context.

==Culture Shock==

In traveling abroad, we are immersed in the values, beliefs, and daily lives of the native culture. Often times, these norms contrast with our own. While there are many benefits of experiencing and interacting with other cultures, some individuals will inevitably have negative experiences. A common problem that occurs with relocation to a foreign area is culture shock. &lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; 
===What is Culture Shock?===
&lt;br /&gt; 
As defined by Merriam-Webster, culture shock is “a sense of confusion and uncertainty sometimes with feelings of anxiety that may affect people exposed to an alien culture or environment without adequate preparation.” Basically, being immersed in an unfamiliar environment can create a sense of shock. Despite the impression from this particular definition, culture shock is not always negative. The symptoms of culture shock are vast, and the experience differs from individual to individual. For some, it is merely a feeling is displacement. In more serious cases, stress, anxiety, feelings of helplessness, confusion, lethargy and depression  are some of the major effects of the condition.&lt;ref&gt;Xia, Junzi  2009 Analysis of Impact of Culture Shock on Individual Psychology. International Journal of Psychological Studies 1(2): 97-101&lt;/ref&gt;  Not every individual will experience all of these factors, and some may not suffer from cultural shock at all. However, it is an entirely normal state, that many are vulnerable to. There is no specific time range where cultural shock will occur. Depending on the situation and circumstance surrounding an person, cultural shock can occur as an initial reaction, or as a consequence of specific events.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt;

===How to Deal with Culture Shock===
&lt;br /&gt; 
While it may be nearly impossible for a traveler to be completely void of cultural shock, there are certain steps that one can take to ease or prevent it from having serious effects. Perhaps the most significant is preparation. Before departing for your destination, do research on different aspects of the culture. Look for major differences from your own culture, and prepare yourself mentally to adapt to these situations. Take into consideration the other factors discussed thus far such as gender, race, religion, cultural norms, dress, sexuality, etc. You might want to question how your identity will be challenged in this new location, and preemptively consider how to deal with these changes. The more you know about your destination, the more prepared you will be to enter that culture.&lt;br /&gt;

Another possible way to prevent or ease cultural shock could be travelling with someone from your country. By having one or more person from your own culture you maybe be able to keep a sense of normality, and feelings of helplessness, anxiety, and depression may be lessened or avoided. 
Another important thing to remember is to keep an open mind. If you find that native cultural values contradict your own, try to embrace these differences rather than frown upon them. Keep in mind that it is these differences that make these cultures unique from your own, and that embracing these new perspectives will broaden your worldview. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

===Learning From Culture Shock===
&lt;br /&gt; 
Though I have not experienced a severe case of cultural shock myself, I have been pushed outside my comfort zone when travelling abroad. As a freshman, I went to Puerto Rico to help repair houses for local people. Upon our arrival in the home of an elderly couple, we were immediately brought into their family and flowered with affections. I recall a sense of discomfort being so quickly embraced by them. To me, it seemed unusual to be so readily accepted. However, I soon open my mind and heart to the family, and learned to genuinely love their tender spirits. I feel that our culture does not easily embrace strangers, and it was both a learning and emotional experience to temporarily be in a society that did. &lt;br /&gt;

When Liz Mogford spent over three years in the Cameroon, she found that she was consistently being introduced to new viewpoints. In her reflection, she explained that culture shock can occur on a spectrum. There are instances that can challenge your entire way of thinking and at times, be difficult to accept. Additionally, there are everyday small occurrences that remind you of the variances between two different paradigms. They do not have to completely shift your worldview, but  they can still provide a sense of a shock or sudden realization, which can even be humorous at times, that may not have occurred inside of your home country.&lt;br /&gt;

When discussing the matter with her, she recalled an example she had from her time in Cameroon. In her village, there were very many children, and she was frequently surrounded by them. One boy, Abba, stood out to her as a particularly sweet child, and she took an affection for him. One day, Liz had the rare opportunity to make a pan of brownies Typically, the ingredients to make these treats were not available. She was able to make a single pan of brownies. It was certainly not enough to share with 50-60 children, but she wanted to give some to Abba, so she saved a couple and waited for a moment that she could get him by himself so he could enjoy them without creating too much of a scene. Her moment of cultural awakening was the humbling realization that occurred when, right after giving the brownies to the boy, he called in all the children and broke off a piece for each of them. In the end, he didn't eat more than a crumb, but that's all he wanted, because he couldn't enjoy them without sharing. &lt;br /&gt;

Liz’s story shows that culture shock can occur in everyday events. Also, it shows that culture shock can be an event that causes you to reflect on your own culture, and perhaps question its norms. The shock, in this case, was for her to realize how she automatically assumed that letting him selfishly hoard the brownies would be a special treat for him. Having all the brownies to himself never even occurred to Abba, whose reaction was to share. In this instance, Liz was challenged to think of how her own values of individualism and self-service were not relevant in Cameroon and the implications of this. She talked about how powerful it was to learn from a child. In a sense, to have a mirror held up to her so that she could see her own selfishness. &lt;br /&gt;

Whether culture shock occurs on a large or small scale, it can be a beneficial learning experience for the individual. It can challenge someone to see things differently, and challenge their previous perceptions. &lt;br /&gt;

People may also find they deal with the most culture shock coming home from their trip abroad. Molly has been back in America for almost two weeks and is noticing a weird transition. Though it is her second time coming back from a long trip, it is not easier nor less strange. She states, &quot;I find coming home to be very strange, and I almost feel like more of a stranger being back.&quot; The culture shock of being home has to do with adjusting to things like driving everywhere, the cost of things, the extremely quick pace of life here and things to get done. These are all big adjustments, but even small adjustments catch her attention, like ordering a small soda, seeing meals big enough to feed an entire household, the huge corporate news sources and the giant stores.

Just being home can be hard to deal with. Back to obligations and reality can be difficult and often the hardest part of traveling. Molly has dealt with not wanting to see anyone but her friends and family. The question becomes, &quot;how do you go from new people and places with a beautifully different culture to the complete opposite and not have a difficult time?&quot; 

As Benjamin Button said about coming home, “It’s a funny thing about comin’ home. Looks the same, smells the same, feels the same. You’ll realize what’s changed is you.”

Once I returned to the United States after my time in Kenya I experienced a difficult transition. More specifically, there were two challenges that I had to face. These challenges can be attributed to social differences. The first challenge that I experienced was the transition from simple Kenyan life to overly complex and scheduled American life. When I returned, I was inundated with an overwhelming array of responsibilities and deadlines. This made me miss Kenya even more. The second challenge was transitioning from a place with incredibly genuine compassion and sense of community to a place with relative coldness and egocentrism. The more I thought about the cross-cultural differences, the angrier I became. Then, I came to the essential realization that my anger came from a relative comparison of Kenyan and American culture. This is an unfair comparison because culture should not be analyzed through the lens of another culture. Culture must be analyzed through the lens the same culture so that it can be understood in its purest form. Once I came to this realization, the transition was made easier for me.

While it might be difficult or frustrating to come home and try to implement what you have learned, try starting with small and subtle ways. While it might be extreme to eat only what you ate there or never buy anything again, it is easier to start by reducing your water usage, turning off lights, and being more sustainable in general. It is hard to find ways to thank or give back to the people who you met along the way but it is a good start to live as a better, kinder person. Do something nice for a friend or smile at a stranger. Think about how the people you met inspired you and why. While you might feel the need to give or donate, that is not what inspired you about the people you met. Give your time and energy first and do what you can to live like the amazing people you met do.

==Religion==

Religion is defined as a set of beliefs and practices to which a group agrees; often including human origins, a code of morals, a set of rituals, and perhaps an explanation of the significance of life. &lt;br /&gt;
Religious differences are prevalent anywhere you go, including your own country, city, school, social group, and maybe even within your family. These differences may become especially apparent when you venture into another country. You will see some cultures in which religion plays a key factor as a bold statement, and others where it is more subtle and personal.  Where ever you go, you will be likely to encounter a variety of different belief systems and people who practice these beliefs in different ways.  Some of the major world religions include: &lt;br /&gt; 
          Christianity &lt;br /&gt;
          Islam &lt;br /&gt;
          Atheism/Agnosticism &lt;br /&gt;
          Buddhism &lt;br /&gt;
          Hinduism &lt;br /&gt;
          Taoism &lt;br /&gt;
          Sikhism &lt;br /&gt;
          Animism and various tribal religions &lt;br /&gt;
          Judaism &lt;br /&gt;
          As well as thousands of other smaller, less universalized religions &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Major Religions Ranked by Size.&quot; World Religions Religion Statistics Geography Church Statistics. 9 Aug. 2007. Web. &lt;http://www.adherents.com/Religions_By_Adherents.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
Regardless of where you are traveling, it would be a good idea to do a bit of research on the most common religious beliefs and practices of the region where you will be spending time.  This way you will not be shocked when you come face to face with perspectives that you were not expecting.  
&lt;br /&gt;
It is important to recognize that all religions are not the same.  There are different gods, different practices, different histories, and countless variations in belief systems.  Some religions are universalizing, requiring a conscious decision and course of action in order to be a member.  These religions are not constrained to any particular group of people, but are open to anyone interested in joining, and often make an effort to recruit new members or spread their beliefs.  Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism are some of today's most well known universalizing religions. Ethnic religions are somewhat the opposite.  Generally, one is born into an ethnic religion and is naturally integrated as a member by being a part of the culture and group.  Ethnic religions are hardly based on a decision, and are very difficult to reject because the rejection of the religion is a rejection of one's culture and people.  These religions also tend to be historical and specifically intended for the particular ethnic group to which they pertain. &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ethnic vs Universal Religions.&quot; Northern Virginia Community College. 3 Mar. 2011. Web. &lt;http://www.nvcc.edu/home/lshulman/rel100/resources/ethnic_religions.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 


Traveling to different parts of the world and being witness to other people’s way of life can make anyone question what they really believe in. After spending seven weeks in Nicaragua during high school and six weeks in Kenya after my freshman year in college, I came across many scenarios that made me question my whole way of thinking. My most meaningful ‘for instance’ was in during my month long stay in Homa Bay. 

During Week of Prayer at Ombogo Girls Academy, an all-girls secondary school, numerous students from Western Washington University volunteered to deliver seventeen hour long sermons to the entire school. I was one of those students. The theme of Prayer Week was “God conquers our concerns” and I chose to base my sermon off of the concern of feeling empty. Being able to relate too many of the girls, I talked about the feelings and emotions I experienced after losing a parent. The first time ever I was talking about how I felt after my father passed away. There have been many times in my life when I have questioned my faith and what I believe in. Reciting my sermon and pouring my heart out to girls I had met just two weeks ago changed me. I might not have known if I had faith in God, but I knew I had faith in them. The love the girls showed me when I was the most vulnerable was incredible. They showed me how to have faith in yourself and in the relationships with the people you love. 


In Kochia, Kenya Christianity is a huge part of life. People pray with you multiple times a day and the food we were eating, the bus ride we were taking and for a safe trip home. It is important to be aware of how you will be involved in the religion of the place you are visiting and be respectful of their traditions.  Even if you are not the same religion as the people respecting their culture and way of life is a must. It is also okay to not be involved in a part of it if it makes you uncomfortable. Being aware of your boundaries is imperative.

Prior to arriving in Kenya I understood that Christianity is the major religion. What I did not yet understand was how big a part of their lives Christianity was. This understanding would only be possible through first-hand experience. Once I arrived, I wondered whether or not I should reveal the fact that I am Jewish because I was worried about the possible reactions. One of the first few days in Kenya, a young girl asked if I was a Christian. I told her a lie and regretted doing so. I felt as if I was devaluing my own religion, and in turn, my individuality. The next time anyone asked what my religion was I told them the truth and the response was always respectful. This experience taught me to embrace your own beliefs even if you run the risk of disrespecting or displeasing someone.

===Questions you should ask before you go===
&lt;br &gt;
What are the main religions in the area you will be visiting? &lt;br /&gt;
How much does religion play into everyday life? &lt;br /&gt;
How has the history of this country affected their religion? &lt;br /&gt;
How do the current politics play into religion in their country? Who funds their programs? Who funds their churches? &lt;br /&gt;
Can I speak freely about my religion? How much do I want to? &lt;br /&gt;
Is there any religious persecution there? &lt;br /&gt;
How do I find information about religion in other countries? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

'''(AND DON'T BE AFRAID TO SEEK MORE)''' &lt;br /&gt;

==Gender Roles and Norms==

When dealing with travel between cultures, there are important aspects to consider that can seem more personal than dress and your ecological footprint. These include the differences between what Americans consider norms in regards to gender/sexual orientation and even your race. It’s important to understand the gender norms of places you travel to before your trip. For example, women in Middle Eastern countries who practice Islamic traditions often wear a burka, an enveloping outer garment worn by women in some Islamic traditions to cover their bodies in public places, in her travels. In a western and or non-practicing Islamic culture, this practice can be easily seen as oppressive, especially since men are not required to cover themselves. However, after class discussions it has become clearer that this practice is not meant to be oppressive as much as it is meant to protect the women from strange men. By knowing about this norm before your trip, you will be able to enter into the new culture with a clearer and more open mind. You will be able to learn more if you can remain as objective as possible. 

It is also important to know about gender roles before your trip because there are often very different ideas about what is acceptable behavior from women. Many women are not allowed to travel without a male companion. If you are a woman and do not feel it necessary to comply, you may face unwanted attention from men. There were several situations talked about in class where females went out to walk/exercise/explore alone and men tried to grab at them and in some cases followed the women around the city. These cultures were not experienced with the idea of a woman being out alone and at times this can be seen as the woman trying to put herself on display. 

Transitioning from a Western culture, this could be very difficult. If you travel to these cultures without the knowledge that gender is viewed differently in other areas, you can lose perspective. While it may seem unfair to an American woman how an Islamic woman lives, it is important to remember that not every woman wants to live like an American. Things we consider to be freedoms, may not be desired by women around the world.

It is important to explore the gender roles of the place you are traveling. When I was in Kochia, Kenya I learned a lot about gender roles. It is hard to learn about gender roles by just observing because it is a complex subject. In Kenya it helped to talk to both men and women in different jobs, and in different classes. I got many different answers so it was difficult to make a solid conclusion about gender roles.  Kochia is a very rural village in Western Kenya. I saw women doing most of the house work, cooking, washing, and childcare while the men took care of the larger jobs like cattle, farming, and building the house. I had to remember that this was just one small village in Kenya, and not to generalize it to the whole country. When talking with people I met from more urban areas like Nairobi gender roles seemed to change. I also learned that when talking about gender there are certain questions to ask that will get you the answers you want. Instead of asking “Do you feel like men and women are equal?” Ask questions like “Where do you feel like you have the most power?”  “How are roles changing over time?”  “If you could change anything about gender roles what would you change?” 
 
Being in Kenya for only six weeks and only a few places was not enough time or experience to grasp to complexity of the gender roles of the area. But talking with individuals enlightened me on some of their traditions such as the dowry.  By learning through making relationships I learned that the dowry is highly respected in Kenya and women feel very positively toward it. It is a sign of security and pride for them and their marriage. Being open to have your perceptions challenged and remembering that the culture you come from is not always the right way is important to remember. It is not about being right and wrong it is about being different and understanding one another.

==Sexual Orientation==

It is smart to be considerate of sexual orientation norms when traveling abroad. Some countries you may visit are not as accommodating of variations from the norms, especially homosexuality.  In some cultures any deviation from heterosexuality is against the law. Over seventy countries still have these laws, such as Afghanistan, Iran, Senegal, Puerto Rico, Kenya and Jamaica (http://www.publicagenda.org/charts/countries-where-homosexuality-illegal). Punishment in some regions can be extreme as death.  One man in Lebanon  said that ”the struggles which a homosexual Muslim man faced when reaching marital age and in trying to avoid the stigma associated with being gay” are extreme. He gives an account of abuse incurred from his father for not acting in ways the father considered manly enough (http://www.yalibnan.com/2010/11/09/lebanese-denied-visa-in-australia-over-sexual-orientation/).  
Amnesty International believes that all humans beings should be able to enjoy the rights declared in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, but many face discrimination and abuse because of their sexual orientation and gender identity.  Amnesty International is calling for the international community to repeal all laws against sexual orientation and to ensure that everyone’s natural human rights are protected, regardless of their sexuality (http://www.amnesty.org/en/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity).  The United Nations has started programs and other commissions to begin protecting sexual orientation in international human rights (http://family.jrank.org/pages/1553/Sexual-Orientation-Sexual-Orientation-Social-Policy.html). Australia and Canada both serve as an example of progress in sexual orientation rights by no longer prohibiting homosexuals from serving in the military.

While traveling abroad, many people may not even think about their sexuality until it becomes a problem. I found that while I was in Kenya, the act of hiding my sexual orientation became a huge challenge for me. I was so used to making everyday comments indicative of my sexuality back at home, and was forced to become hyper aware of them while in Kenya. I found it to be a major challenge to me that while I made great friends in Kenya, they didn't know part of me. I was torn about the fact that I felt like it was such an integral part of who I am, but people I was calling best friends didn't know that about me. However, I also found that it was something that didn't affect my relationships. My friendships were genuine, even without knowing that. I think the experience I had of having to hide that about myself has made me more dedicated to creating an open, safe environment for people who do not follow the heterosexual normative, and how important it is to provide worldwide human rights under the basis of sexual orientation.

Sometimes, one’s beliefs might conflict with that of the culture. In Kenya, it is illegal to be homosexual. Yet as a psychology major who believes that homosexuals should have equal rights, I encountered an uncomfortable experience when a professor and friend asked me to help him answer a psychological homework problem. The situation was that “5 female students were expelled due to lesbianism” and I had to “A. Describe multiple psychological reasons for this maladjusted behavior” and “B. Suggest forms of punishment or action for each psychological theory”. I felt uncomfortable remaining silent and expressing my views. I told him that the APA removed homosexuality as a mental illness so I couldn’t comment on it psychologically, but when he asked my personal viewpoints and how I would counsel someone with this “problem” I had to state my views and how I was raised. I told him that I was taught to not view it as a problem and to counsel with the idea that someone accepts their identity. However, while he didn’t agree with my opinion, he was very understanding that in America, we do things differently. While, I don’t think it would be a good idea to attack their beliefs or laws, I think it’s important to share your thinking in a respectful way.

One of the last things I expected to do on the trip was dance with another guy.  Got your attention?  Good.  Within the first few days of the trip I was confronted with the stark differences in the ways cultures can approach gender roles.  In the United States, where homosexuality has become widely accepted, there lasts a sort of hyper-awareness in which straight men make certain not to be mistaken as gay.  In Kenya, where homosexuality is illegal, men are shamelessly friendly to other men, because everyone is expected to be straight.  At first this seemed counter-intuitive to me, and it took me a while to adjust to the way that typical Kenyan men relate.  I was caught off guard when men would grab my hand, or be so immediately friendly and welcoming, and I would express a sort of reactionary awkwardness, withholding my own welcome.  Though I wish I had let go of my preconceptions sooner, I eventually became accustomed to this harmless and friendly sign of respect.  At first confused by the man who stood, facing me at the club, demonstrating an East African dance move, I eventually learned how to throw one back at him.

==Race==

What are your country’s relations with the country you’re traveling to? If you are a white person traveling to Africa, you may be met with more apprehension in a region that has a legacy of slavery. While you were most likely not directly involved with the slave trade, you have benefited from the culminating effects of being white. You may be faced with association with those who were and still are taking active roles in suppressing other cultures. Therefore, it is important to research your country’s history with the region to which you are traveling. Once you are aware of the history and past events, you can be more sensitive and open minded to the people you encounter. If you meet situations with this type of mindset, this could serve as a way to ease future relations.
&lt;br /&gt;

There are histories of colonialism and foreign aid in regions such as Africa. This legacy of colonialism has had profound effects on the countries' development and often represent reasons why Western cultures view them as underdeveloped. As a foreigner, it is important to understand the impacts past events have on the present. These past events will also effect relations. People living in less developed countries are not incompetent, they are simply facing a culmination of obstacles. When traveling to these countries, treat those living there with respect because often times they are not looking for a westerner to &quot;save&quot; them. 

It also important to consider how the perception of your race might alter in a new location. For example, in America, many of us may identify with a particular part of our ancestry that is different from a white, European background. Those who are multiracial may choose to identify with the more ethnic side of their heritage, rather than the European side. When traveling abroad, however, your racial or ethnic identity is likely to be perceived as the more homogenous &quot;white American.&quot; While it may feel as though there is a disconnect between how you view yourself and how you are viewed by locals, you are likely to become more aware of your own cultural identity while abroad. For example, though you might identify as a different ethnicity or race while in America, going abroad may show you how your paradigm is structured by a society that is predominantly white.

African Americans also struggle with this, especially when visiting Africa. They may feel a sense of homecoming and excitement to be back in the land of their ancestry. However the people living there often still see them as foreigners. They are often times viewed as black Americans, instead of African Americans. There are some countries though, such as Ghana, who make it easier for black Americans by providing them with &quot;right of abode&quot;. This right allows them those who qualify to work and own property within the country, eventually making it easier to assimilate. (http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6818533/ns/us_news-life/t/some-black-americans-returning-africa/)

When we were in Kenya, I had a difficult time when it came to my race. Being Korean, I was the only non-white person on the trip. All of the Kenyans called me Chinese. At first I would explain that I am not Chinese, I am Korean. I even brought a map of Asia to the school with a circle around Korea that I could show the girls. But then I realized that when I told them I was Korean they thought that I was a Korean citizen that I left Korea to go to Kenya. So then I started saying that I was American and then people just stopped believing me, saying that I must be Chinese because I look so &quot;chinky&quot;. I don't really know how I felt about it and I still don't. I wasn't offended by it because I grew up in the midwest where my family was the only Asian family around and I was always made fun of because I was Asian. But this was different. It felt like they were not letting me claim an identity. Most of them didn't acknowledge that Korea was an actual place outside of China or understand how I could not be white and be from America. It was difficult but I grew to accept it and remember that I can still claim my identity as a Korean American. Also, to the girls that became my close friends my race didn't matter, I was just Nicole. And that made it much easier to brush it off when a stranger called me chinky.

While having the pleasure to interact with Kenyans on the trip, I often noticed a brief grace period between initial acknowledgement of differences, and the eventual acknowledgement of more substantial similarities.  In Kochia, where many of the local children have never seen a caucasian, they would point and yell &quot;mzungu!&quot; as we passed.  The wide eyes and timid stares we received is the sort of greeting I would expect to be given to a Martian.  Yet eventually, these children began walking with us, grasping hands securely as they led us around.  I recall the frequency that I would have my skin squished and examined, leg hairs tugged and plucked, and hair pulled.  One child in particular took careful time, poking my arm and freckles, sizing up each one of my knuckles individually.  After fully investigating the shape and consistency of my arms, legs, and head, he concluded, &quot;you're almost African!&quot;  Whether he expected scales and tentacles, I'm not sure, but what I am certain about is that by allowing time for locals, and especially children, to investigate you, the quicker that mythical differences that at first separate us, can be efficiently dispelled.

==Boredom==
&lt;br /&gt;
===Will I get bored?===
&lt;br /&gt;
Depending on the amount of structure involved in your trip, you may or may not experience boredom.  According to Webster boredom is &quot;the state of being weary and restless through a lack of interest.&quot;  The hope in traveling to another country is that there will be no lack of interest. However, as a human, it is possible that you will find yourself bored at least once.  The good news is, there are many solutions to boredom!

In Kenya we were always together and always had something to do so boredom was not an issue. And when we did have a day off, it was a relief and an opportunity to rest and hang out. Although we made many friendships with locals in the village, we became a very tight group where we supported each other and laughed together. We learned how to pass the time together and used our time well so we could experience as much as we could. Going on walks was a common activity of choice during down times and was also an excellent way to get to know each other. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

===What should I do if I get bored?===
&lt;br /&gt;
Just because you are not at home does not mean that people don't enjoy any of the things you enjoy. As you travel to the country that you are visiting, take the time to make a list of 10-15 things you would like to do if you got bored on the trip.  Think about the opportunities you will have at your destination and take them into consideration as you draw up your list. You can even add to your list as something to do should you get bored. Here area few other ideas:

&lt;br /&gt;

Strike up conversation with the people around you.  This might serve to be a perfect opportunity to practice the language or learn about the culture.  Not to mention, you will make friends if you are social.  Ask all kinds of questions.  Ask random questions that draw out laughter, ask provoking questions that challenge people's understandings, and ask questions about experiences, about culture, about family.  These conversations could lead to friendships that eliminate the possibility of boredom at all. 

During my time in Kenya, the most important thing I did was strike up conversation with locals. I had so many questions for them, and I found they had just as many for me. By having these conversations, I also bonded with these people I met, and formed lasting relationships. People want to tell their stories, and have so many insightful things that can be shared. I would often ask people about their families, goals, lifestyles, wants and desires, hardships, struggles, ambitions, and histories. Or would ask them cultural questions about religion, housing, politics, history, global issues, climate change, or gender roles. These are topics that I think are vital to the understanding of a culture. During these conversations, I had many people also ask me about life in America, our culture, and my family and lifestyle choices. It was often a very equal relationship that I formed, where we both were able to both give and take in the learning exchange. 

&lt;br /&gt;

Many times boredom can be a result of being tired.  If you are feeling lazy or unmotivated, try a quick nap or a brisk walk to rejuvenate your body.  You could also play a game.  Ask the people you have traveled with or are staying with if they would like to play a game and play it. 

&lt;br /&gt; 

Another idea to combat boredom is to write about your experiences.  Take a small journal or notebook and a pen whenever you can in case your plans change and you find yourself becoming bored.  You can write about the events going on, your emotions, your reactions to cultural differences, and many other things, and in the end you will have a written memory of your journey, including all of your ups and downs and relationships and challenges.
&lt;br /&gt;

===Do I need permission to do something?/Can I do it alone or do I need a partner?===
&lt;br /&gt;
The answers to these questions will vary depending on your group.  It is important that you know the rules of your group and organization so that you do not lose their trust.  You also ought to have some knowledge of the area you are in and the conditions and [[International_Service_Learning_Study_Abroad_Handbook/Saftey|safety]] of your area.  If you a feeling bored, there may be others who are feeling the same way. Together you might be able to stroll through town or visit a historical location.  

==Homesickness==
&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to culture shock, traveling abroad can also cause an individual to have feelings of homesickness. Being apart from home for such any amount of time can result in this; however, it will likely be more formidable when traveling long distances to a new culture. Therefore, one should take into consideration the possibility that this will occur and prepare for it in advance. A potential way to fight homesickness is to remain in contact with friends and family during your trip. It may not be realistic or desirable to rely on internet connections for access to Skype, e-mail, or Facebook. Another possible alternative would be to buy a cell phone that will work in the country you plan to stay in. This will allow you speak directly with those at home for a reasonable price. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If costs or other factors prohibit you from purchasing a cell phone, a phone card would serve the same purpose, assuming you will be staying in an urban area where you will have access to phone booths. Otherwise, traditional mail would be a great way to keep in touch. Though it may take longer to correspond with each other, letters are highly personal, and could contain photos, stories, newspaper clippings, and more. It may be beneficial to arrange with friends an family a way to contact each other via mail before you leave. You could possibly suggest that they mail you before your journey, so that before you arrive, you will already have a piece of home making its way to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another thing to consider is to bring small, memorable items with you. These items could serve as a way to provide comfort during your stay. If you choose to do so, however, consider that these items should be travel-sized and not incredibly significant. That way, if the item were to be misplaced or lost, it would not be a huge loss. Bringing pictures of home that can be safely tucked away would be both realistic and comforting. You could also use these images to connect to locals. By sharing with them these photos of your family and friends, you can help establish relationships with them while easing some of the feelings of homesickness.&lt;br /&gt;

==New Home Sickness==

Depending on your experience, you may discover that you have found another home during your time overseas.  I certainly did.  In Kenya I had 130 new sisters, some of whom became my dearest friends; I had a group of &quot;Mama's&quot; at the home we were staying in, who cooked for us, taught us how to cook, welcomed us everyday, and missed us while we were at school; I had a future mother in law who jokingly wanted me to marry her ten year old son, but truly loved me like a daughter; and I had a surrogate father who made me laugh at every meal and told us story after story after story. The day we left Kochia, I felt like I was leaving my family and it was harder than leaving my biological family.

Of course it was wonderful to be reunited with my true mother, father, sister, and dog, but the process of getting used to being away from my Kenya family was infinitely worse than any home-sickness I had while traveling. So if and when you are facing home sickness for your new home, it is important to remember that it is normal to miss people and places where you left your heart.  Take some time to adjust back to life and instead of holding onto the sadness of leaving, choose to celebrate the time that you had and the relationships you made. As Winnie said, &quot;You just have to get used to it.&quot; You don't have to forget anything or anyone, and you don't have to &quot;move on with your life,&quot; you just have to get used to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Digital Gates==
a digital gate is a Digital Device used to perform a logic operation on the input(s) to produce an equivalent logic result in the output. The output produced from the inputs are listed in a table called a [[w:Truth table|Truth table]]. The relation between output and inputs can also be represented by a mathematical equation.

==Basic Digital Gates==
There are 5 basic digital [[w:Logic gate|logic gates]] used to perform logic operations namely [[/Buffer/]], [[w:Inverter (logic gate)|NOT (Inverter)]], [[w:AND Gate|AND Gate]], [[w:OR Gate|OR Gate]], [[w:XOR Gate|XOR Gate]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Logic NAND==
NAND gates are one of the two basic logic gates (the other being NOR logic) from which any other logic gates can be built. Due to this property, NAND and NOR gates are sometimes called &quot;universal gates&quot;. However, modern integrated circuits are not constructed exclusively from a single type of gate. Instead, EDA tools are used to convert the description of a logical circuit to a netlist of complex gates (standard cells) or transistors (full custom approach).

==Combined Gates==
===NOT===
A NOT gate is made by joining the inputs of a NAND gate. Since a NAND gate is equivalent to an AND gate followed by a NOT gate, joining the inputs of a NAND gate leaves only the NOT part.

|-

|}
|}

===AND===
An AND gate is made by following a NAND gate with a NOT gate as shown below. This gives a NOT NAND, i.e. AND.

|-
| 0 || 1 ||  || 0
|-
| 1 || 0 ||  || 0
|-
| 1 || 1 ||  || 1
|}
|}

===OR===
If the truth table for a NAND gate is examined or by applying [[A-level Computing/AQA/Computer Components, The Stored Program Concept and the Internet/Fundamental Hardware Elements of Computers/De Morgan's Laws|De Morgan's Laws]], it can be seen that if any of the inputs are 0, then the output will be 1. However to be an OR gate, if any input is 1, the output must also be 1. Therefore, if the inputs are inverted, any high input will trigger a high output.

| 1 || 0 ||  || 1
|-
| 1 || 1 ||  || 1
|}
|}

===NOR===
A NOR gate is simply an OR gate with an inverted output:

|-
|[[Image:NOR ANSI Labelled.svg]]||[[Image:NOR from NAND.svg]]

|-
| 0 || 1 ||  || 0
|-
| 1 || 0 ||  || 0
|-
| 1 || 1 ||  || 0
|}
|}

===XOR===
An XOR gate is constructed similarly to an OR gate, except with an additional NAND gate inserted such that if both inputs are high, the inputs to the final NAND gate will also be high, and the output will be low. This effectively represents the formula: &quot;(A NAND (A NAND B)) NAND (B NAND (A NAND B))&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Half adder==
When adding 2 numbers we will have a Sum and a Carry . Let first number be A and Second number be B then adding A + B will produce a Sum S and a carry C
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
! &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; !! &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;

|}

From above, In term of logic gate AND will produce a sum of two input . logic gate XOR produce carry
:&lt;math&gt;S = A \oplus B&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C = A \cdot B&lt;/math&gt;

Half Adder can constructed from AND gate and XOR gate as shown below
:[[File:Half Adder.svg|Half adder circuit diagram]]

==Full adder==
The above case is just a special case when there is no Carry . If there is Carry then

:&lt;math&gt;S = (A \oplus B) \oplus C_{in}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;C_{out} = (A \cdot B) + (C_{in} \cdot (A \oplus B)) &lt;/math&gt;

A full adder can be constructed from two half adders by connecting ''A'' and ''B'' to the input of one half adder, connecting the sum from that to an input to the second adder, connecting ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' to the other input and OR the two carry outputs.  Equivalently, ''S'' could be made the three-bit XOR of ''A'', ''B'', and ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''C&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;'' could be made the three-bit [[majority function]] of ''A'', ''B'', and ''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''.

==Multiple-bit adders==
===Ripple carry adder===
It is possible to create a logical circuit using multiple full adders to add ''N''-bit numbers. Each full adder inputs a ''C&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;'', which is the ''C&lt;sub&gt;out&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the previous adder. This kind of adder is a ''ripple carry adder'', since each carry bit &quot;ripples&quot; to the next full adder. Note that the first (and only the first) full adder may be replaced by a half adder.

The layout of  ripple carry adder is simple, which allows for fast design time; however, the ripple carry adder is relatively slow, since each full adder must wait for the carry bit to be calculated from the previous full adder.
The [[gate delay]] can easily be calculated by inspection of the full adder circuit.
Each full adder requires three levels of logic.  In a 32-bit [ripple carry] adder, there 32 full adders,so the critical path (worst case) delay is &lt;math&gt;32*3=96&lt;/math&gt; gate delays.

===Carry look-ahead adders===
{{main|Carry look-ahead adder}}

To reduce the computation time, engineers devised faster ways to add two binary numbers by using [[carry lookahead adder]]s.
They work by creating two signals (''P'' and ''G'') for each bit position, based on whether a carry is propagated through from a less significant bit position (at least one input is a '1'), a carry is generated in that bit position (both inputs are '1'), or if a carry is killed in that bit position (both inputs are '0').  In most cases, ''P'' is simply the sum output of a half-adder and ''G'' is the carry output of the same adder.  After ''P'' and ''G'' are generated the carries for every bit position are created.  Some advanced carry look ahead architectures are the [[Manchester carry chain]], [[Brent-Kung adder]], and the [[Kogge-Stone adder]].
: [[Image:4-bit carry lookahead adder.svg|none|framed|4-bit adder with Carry Look Ahead]]

Some other multi-bit adder architectures break the adder into blocks.  It is possible to vary the length of these blocks based on the propagation delay of the circuits to optimize computation time.  These block based adders include the [[carry bypass adder]] which will determine ''P'' and ''G'' values for each block rather than each bit, and the [[carry select adder]] which pre-generates sum and carry values for either possible carry input to the block.

Other adder designs include the [[conditional sum adder]], [[carry skip adder]], and [[carry complete adder]].

===Lookahead Carry Unit===
{{main|Lookahead Carry Unit}}

By combining multiple carry look-ahead adders even larger adders can be created.
This can be used at multiple levels to make even larger adders.
For example, the following adder is a 64-bit adder that uses four 16-bit CLAs with two levels of LCUs.

[[File:HalfSubtractor.svg|200px]]
The half-subtractor is a [[logic circuit|combinational circuit]] which is used to perform subtraction of two [[bits]]. It has two inputs, X ([[minuend]]) and Y ([[subtrahend]]) and two outputs D (difference) and B (borrow).

== Truth Table ==

The truth table for the half subtractor is given below. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.shef.ac.uk/physics/teaching/phy107/logicsub.html|title=&quot;Subtraction using Logic gates&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the above table one can draw the [[Karnaugh map]]  for &quot;difference&quot; and &quot;borrow&quot;.

== Full Subtractor ==

The Full_subtractor is a [[logic circuit|combinational circuit]] which is used to perform subtraction of three [[bits]]. It has two inputs, X ([[minuend]]) and Y ([[subtrahend]] and Z ([[subtrahend]) and two outputs D (difference) and B (borrow).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Digital Encoder==
Digital Encoder is a Digital Device opposite of the Digital Decoder . A simple encoder circuit can receive a single active input out of 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; input lines generate a binary code on ''n'' parallel output lines.

For example a single bit 4 to 2 encoder takes in 4 bits and outputs 2 bits.  The illustrated gate level example implements the simple encoder defined by the truth table, but it MUST be understood that for all the non-explicitly defined input combinations (i.e. inputs containing 0, 2, 3, or 4 bits) the outputs are treated as don't cares.  Thus this implementation is useless as a priority encoder and only useful as a simple encoder if some previous circuit guarantees that there is one and only one bit high in the input or if it is understood that non-single-active-inputs will produce garbage encodings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Digital demultiplexers==
Demultiplexers take one data input and a number of selection inputs, and they have several outputs.
They forward the data input to one of the outputs depending on the values of the selection inputs.
Demultiplexers are sometimes convenient for designing general purpose logic, because if the demultiplexer's input is always true, the demultiplexer acts as a [[decoder]].
This means that any function of the selection bits can be constructed by logically OR-ing the correct set of outputs.

Register is a Digital Device constructed from basic Digital Gates to perform a task or a function

==Register Types==
===SR Register===
In some situations it may be desirable to dictate when the latch can and cannot latch.  The '''gated SR latch''' is a simple extension of the SR latch which provides an ''Enable'' line which must be driven high before data can be latched.  Even though a control line is now required, the SR latch is not synchronous, because the inputs can change the output even in the middle of an enable pulse.

When the ''Enable'' input is low, then the outputs from the AND gates must also be low, thus the ''Q'' and {{overline|''Q''}} outputs remain latched to the previous data.  Only when the enable input is high can the state of the latch change, as shown in the truth table. When the enable line is asserted, a gated SR latch is identical in operation to an SR latch.

The ''Enable'' line is sometimes a clock signal, but is usually a read or write [[Digital Circuits/Glossary#S|strobe]].

[[File:SR (Clocked) Flip-flop Diagram.svg|300px]]

|}

===D Register===
The '''D latch''' (D for &quot;data&quot;) or '''transparent latch''' is a simple extension of the gated SR latch that removes the possibility of invalid input states.

Since the gated SR latch allows us to latch the output without using the ''S'' or ''R'' inputs, we can remove one of the inputs by driving both the ''Set'' and ''Reset'' inputs with a complementary driver: we remove one input and automatically make it the inverse of the remaining input.

The D latch outputs the ''D'' input whenever the ''Enable'' line is high, otherwise the output is whatever the ''D'' input was when the ''Enable'' input was last high. This is why it is also known as a transparent latch - when ''Enable'' is asserted, the latch is said to be &quot;transparent&quot; - it signals propagate directly through it as if it isn't there.

D latches are often used in I/O ports of integrated circuits and are available as discrete devices, often multiply packaged. An example is the 74HC75, part of the 7400 series of ICs, containing four separate D latches.

===JK Register===
The JK flip-flop is a simple enhancement of the SR flip-flop where the state J=K=1
is not forbidden. It works just like a SR FF where J is serving as set input
and K serving as reset. The only difference is
that for the formerly “forbidden” combination J=K=1 this flip-flop now performs
an action: it inverts its state.
As the behavior of the JK flip-flop is completely predictable under all conditions,
this is the preferred type of flip-flop for most logic circuit designs.
But there is still a problem i.e. both the outputs are same when one tests the circuit practically. This is because of the
internal toggling on every propagation elapse completion. The main remeady is going for master-slave jk flip-flop,this ff overrides the self(internal) recurring toggling through the pulsed clocking feature incorporated.

===T flip-flops===
A '''T flip-flop''' is a device which swaps or &quot;toggles&quot; state every time it is triggered if the ''T'' input is asserted, otherwise it holds the current output. This behavior is described by the characteristic equation:

::&lt;math&gt;Q_{next} = T \oplus Q = T\overline{Q} + \overline{T}Q&lt;/math&gt;

and can be described either of the following tables:



[[Image:T-Type Flip-flop.svg|A circuit symbol for a T-type flip-flop: T is the toggle input and Q is the stored data output.]]
{| 
|
{| class=wikitable
 |+ '''Characteristic table'''
 ! width=40 | T !! width=40 | Q
 | rowspan=5|
 ! width=40 | Q&lt;sub&gt;next&lt;/sub&gt;
 ! width=60 | Comment
 |-
 | 0 || 0 || 0 || rowspan = 2 | Hold state
 |-

 | 0 || 0 || 0 
 |-
 | 0 || 1 || 1
 |-
 | 1 || 0 || 1 
 |-
 | 1 || 1 || 0
|}
|}

When ''T'' is held high, the toggle flip-flop divides the clock frequency by two; that is, if clock frequency is 4 MHz, the output frequency obtained from the flip-flop will be 2 MHz. This 'divide-by' feature has application in various types of digital [[Digital Circuits/Counters|counters]].  A ''T'' flip-flop can also be built using a JK flip-flop (J &amp; K pins are connected together and act as T) or D flip-flop (''T'' input and ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;prev&lt;/sub&gt; are connected to the ''D'' input through an XOR gate).

ASCII stands for American Standard Communication Information Interchange is the first standard introduced in North America for Information exchange . ASCII uses 7 bits Binary numbers to represent information in human language 
# Number from 0 to 9
# Capital A to Z
# Common a to z

==ASCII Code==
Code 0x20 ([[w:hexadecimal|hexadecimal]]), the [[w:Space (punctuation)|space character]], denotes the space between words, as produced by the space-bar of a keyboard. The space character is considered an invisible graphic rather than a control character. Codes 0x21 to 0x7E, known as the printable characters, represent letters, digits, [[w:punctuation marks|punctuation marks]], and a few miscellaneous symbols.

Good math skills in algebra, geometry, basic trigonometry, and statistics are needed for advanced geography work. Computer skills are needed to work with Geographical Information Systems.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Sources for religious obligation'''&lt;br /&gt;
According to mainstream Islamic scholars, covering all but the face and hands in opaque loose material when in public is obligatory for all Muslim women who have reached menarche. Covering is also considered obligatory during prayer. &lt;ref&gt;http://qa.sunnipath.com/issue_view.asp?ID=4834&lt;/ref&gt;
The verse quoted to explain the obligation of head covering for women is in Surah al-Nur, ayah 31: &quot;And say to the believing women that they should lower their gaze and guard their modesty; that they should not display their beauty and ornaments except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof; that they should draw their veils over their bosoms and not display their beauty except to their husbands, their fathers, their husband's fathers, their sons, their husbands' sons, their brothers or their brothers' sons, or their sisters' sons, or their women, or the slaves whom their right hands possess, or male servants free of physical needs, or small children who have no sense of the shame of sex; and that they should not strike their feet in order to draw attention to their hidden ornaments. And O ye Believers! turn ye all together towards Allah, that ye may attain Bliss.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.usc.edu/schools/college/crcc/engagement/resources/texts/muslim/quran/024.qmt.html&lt;/ref&gt;

This requirement is relaxed for older women, as Surah al-Nur, ayah 60, states: &quot;Such elderly women as are past the prospect of marriage - there is no blame on them if they lay aside their (outer) garments, provided they make not a wanton display of their beauty: but it is best for them to be modest: and Allah is One Who sees and knows all things.&quot; But older women who are used to wearing hijab may continue wearing it past this point. 

The Qur'an does not address head covering during prayer, but a hadith states: &quot;The Prophet (peace_be_upon_him) said: Allah does not accept the prayer of a woman who has reached puberty unless she wears a veil.&quot; This is interpreted to include prayers in private as well as congregational prayer. 

'''Alternate views'''&lt;br /&gt;
Some lay Muslims and Muslim scholars have come to the conclusion that covering the body and a general attitude of modesty is required of Muslim men and women, but that covering the head is not required. They point out that the Qur'an directs women to cover &quot;except what (must ordinarily) appear thereof&quot;, and that in Arab society, this did not include the head, whereas in other cultural contexts, the head and neck ordinarily appear. This view is not widely accepted among Islamic scholars.

'''Differentiation: Financial Policy vs. Monetary Policy'''

We seldom get to hear something about monetary policy in the media, but we often hear news about politicians’ current decisions on financial plans and similar things. It must be said that monetary policy and financial policy are very different topics: financial policy deals with the budget of the state, how funds should be allocated and what they should be used for. In contrast to that monetary policy deals with the amount of money in circulation and its value. 


'''Central Banks: Implementation of Monetary Policy'''

Monetary policy is conducted by central banks. These are institutions that have the exclusive right to issue the money of an economy. As a consequence the central bank controls the amount of money in circulation and therefore its value. That is, what monetary policy is basically about, maintaining the value of the currency, also called price stability. In order to do so, central banks use monetary instruments that allow them to control the money supply. What makes monetary policy interesting  and also fairly difficult is its effect on the economy in the short-run because monetary policy, can influence the short-term fluctuations of economic output. That is why many central banks not only have the aim to maintain price stability but also to support their economy, if possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Basic Regular Expressions''': Note that particular implementations of regular expressions interpret the backslash symbol differently in front of some of the metacharacters. For example, egrep and perl interpret ''unbackslashed'' parentheses and vertical bars as metacharacters, reserving the backslashed versions to mean the literal characters themselves. Old versions of grep did not support the pipe alternation operator.

|-
| &quot;[hc]at$&quot; || ''hat'' and ''cat'' but only at the end of a line

Since many ranges of characters depends on the chosen locale setting (e.g., in some settings letters are organized as abc..yzABC..YZ while in some others as aAbBcC..yYzZ).

The [[../Posix Basic Regular Expressions/]] syntax provided extensions for consistency between utility programs such as grep, sed and awk. These extensions are not supported by some traditional implementations of Unix tools.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===POSIX modern (extended) regular expressions===

The more modern &quot;extended&quot; regular expressions can often be used with modern Unix utilities by including the command line flag &quot;-E&quot;. 

POSIX extended regular expressions are similar in syntax to the traditional Unix regular expressions, with some exceptions.  The following metacharacters are added:

* '''+''' — Match the last &quot;block&quot; one or more times - &quot;ba+&quot; matches &quot;ba&quot;, &quot;baa&quot;, &quot;baaa&quot; and so on
* '''?''' — Match the last &quot;block&quot; zero or one times - &quot;ba?&quot; matches &quot;b&quot; or &quot;ba&quot;&lt;/td&gt;
* '''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''' — The choice (or set union) operator: match either the expression before or the expression after the operator - &quot;abc|def&quot; matches &quot;abc&quot; or &quot;def&quot;.&lt;/td&gt;

Also, backslashes are removed: \{...\} becomes {...} and \(...\) becomes (...). Examples:
* &quot;[hc]+at&quot; matches with &quot;hat&quot;, &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;hhat&quot;, &quot;chat&quot;, &quot;hcat&quot;, &quot;ccchat&quot; etc.
* &quot;[hc]?at&quot; matches &quot;hat&quot;, &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;at&quot;
* &quot;([cC]at)|([dD]og)&quot; matches &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;Cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot; and &quot;Dog&quot;

Since the characters '(', ')', '[', ']', '.', '*', '?', '+', '^' and '$' are used as special symbols they have to be escaped if they are meant literally. This is done by preceding them with '\' which therefore also has to be escaped this way if meant literally. Examples:
:&quot;a\.(\(|\))&quot; matches with the string &quot;a.)&quot; or &quot;a.(&quot;

      <comment>POSIX modern is probably intended to mean POSIX Extended Regular Expressions</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">
Perl has a richer and more predictable syntax than even the [[../POSIX Extended Regular Expressions/]] syntax. An example of its predictability is that \ always quotes a non-alphanumeric character. An example of something that is possible to specify with Perl but not POSIX is whether part of the match wanted to be greedy or not.  For instance in the pattern /a.*b/, the .* will match as much as it can, while in the pattern /a.*?b/, .*? will match as little.  So given the string &quot;a bad dab&quot;, the first pattern will match the whole string, and the second will only match &quot;a b&quot;.

For these reasons, many other utilities and applications have adopted syntaxes that look a lot like Perl's. For example, Java, Ruby, Python, PHP, exim, BBEdit, and even Microsoft's .NET Framework all use regular expression syntax similar to that used in perl. Not all &quot;Perl-compatible&quot; regular expression implementations are identical, and many implement only a subset of Perl's features.

== Examples ==

'''Conventions''' used in the examples: The character 'm' is not always required to specify a perl match operation. For example, m/[^abc]/ could also be rendered as /[^abc]/. The 'm' is only necessary if the user wishes to specify a match operation without using a forward-slash as the regex delimiter. Sometimes it is useful to specify an alternate regex delimiter in order to avoid &quot;delimiter collision&quot;. See '[http://perldoc.perl.org/perlre.html perldoc perlre]' for more details.

    metacharacter(s) ;; the metacharacters column specifies the regex syntax being demonstrated
    =~ m//           ;; indicates a regex '''match''' operation in perl    
    =~ s///          ;; indicates a regex '''substitution''' operation in perl

In the table heading below, &quot;M-c&quot; stands for &quot;Metacharacters&quot;.
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- 
! M-c || Description || Example&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;All the if statements return a TRUE value.&lt;/small&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;'''.'''&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Normally matches any character except a newline. Within square brackets the dot is literal.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
if (&quot;Hello World\n&quot; =~ m/...../) {

&lt;/tr&gt;
    
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;( )&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Groups a series of pattern elements to a single element.  When you match a pattern within parentheses, you can use any of $1, $2, ... later to refer to the previously matched pattern.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
if (&quot;Hello World\n&quot; =~ m/(H..).(o..)/) {

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview: Objectives of Monetary Policy ==

Monetary policy is how a central bank acts in its economic environment. A central bank is a national (or, in the case of the European Central Bank, a supranational) institution. Mostly the primary goal is to maintain price stability. Another common goal is to support the economy if it does not inhibit the achievement of price stability to a risky extent. This chapter examines what different costs arise due to inflation (increasing prices) and why it makes sense to keep inflation at a moderate level, to maintain price stability respectively. 

Monetary policy is subject to a so called “''assignment''”. It is the definition of the central bank’s objectives and its instruments. It is a precondition for basically two aspects: economic efficiency and the central bank's accountability. Economic efficiency is given because of the knowledge that economic agents have about the central bank. They know its objectives and its means to achieve these objectives. Although they do not know how the central bank will act in any given circumstance it will provide the grounds for a sound prediction of what could potentially happen (e.g. because the people are sure that the central bank will always make decisions against the background of price stability they are likely to save money.) The other aspect is accountability: the only possibility to held the central bank accountable for what it has done is the assignment, the guidelines to which the central bank needs to adhere. Whether what the central bank did was good or bad can only be ascertained by comparing the given objectives with what the central bank has achieved.

In order to plan monetary policy and to measure its success an objective function is used that accounts for the rate of inflation and economic output:


&lt;math&gt;f(\pi^*,Y^*) = \frac{1}{2} [(\pi_{t+1}-\pi^*)^2 + \lambda(Y_{t+1}-Y^*)^2]&lt;/math&gt;


''π*'' describes the targeted rate of inflation, &lt;math&gt;\pi_{t+1}&lt;/math&gt; the achieved rate of inflation in one year. Monetary policy's effects are time-shifted, the real effects are perceived later, that is why the rate of inflation in one year is of importance. The same way &lt;math&gt;Y_{t+1}&lt;/math&gt; is the economic output in one year whereas ''Y*'' is the targeted economic output. The difference of both is squared to get a positive result. That assures that there is no interpretative difference between a deviation downwards or a deviation upwards, both are not desired. For the sake of simplicity 1/2 is written in front of the formula because it simplifies the first mathematical derivative. ''λ'' has a special meaning: If it is equal to 0 then economic output does not matter to monetary policy, but if it is larger than 0, then economic output matters. The value of ''λ'' describes in how far the economic output matters relative to the rate of inflation. The two cases can be distinguished as follows:


λ = 0: ''strict inflation targeting''

λ &gt; 0: ''flexible inflation targeting''



It is the central bank's task to find values for ''π*'' and ''Y*'' that create stability for the economy. Empirical evidence suggests that the rate of inflation should be between 0% and 3%. The target value for ''Y*'' should be equal to the economy's natural level of output &lt;math&gt;Y^n&lt;/math&gt;. As a low rate of inflation, in the most cases, should be first priority, ''λ'' has a small value, which gives the economic output a slight significance, but does not exceed the rate of inflation in importance.


'''Theoretical background'''
[[File:ADASmoneyshortandlongrun.PNG‎|frame|x150px|Increase in M shifts AD to the right, the output Y increases (A to B) but in the long run only prices will be affected (B to C).]]
The theoretical background for &lt;math&gt;Y^* = Y^n&lt;/math&gt; is the assumption that in the long-run the economy will equilibrate and the output of an economy in its equilibrium is called the natural level of output. Money cannot influence the natural level of output because in the long-run changes in the money supply only result in corresponding price changes. This is called the ''neutrality of money'': prices will adjust to the quantity of money in circulation. Another important concept is the ''superneutrality of money'': the growth rate of the money supply does not affect economic output. Therefore sustained economic growth is no goal of monetary policy as such, but, as in the short-run monetary policy has an effect on real variables, a stabilization around the natural level of output.

The central bank needs to give a target for π* because inflation is a monetary phenomenon: there exists no natural level of inflation, but inflation is dependend on the money supply and the central bank controls the money supply. Consequently inflation is the result of the central bank's way of proceeding and therefore the central bank needs to give a target value.  



== Costs of Inflation: Anticipated Inflation ==

Even if everybody knows that inflation is coming and even if everybody knows the rate of inflation, it will result in costs for the economy. In what way costs are caused is examined in the subsequent parts.

=== Liquidity Preference and the Utility of Money ===

One cost of inflation arises due to an individual's liquidity preference in connection with the money's utility. If the individual keeps cash then interest that could be earned on that money is forgone. The nominal interest rate ''i'' that is earned contains both, a real interest rate ''r'' and an additional ''π'' to compensate for inflation, the loss of purchasing power. 


&lt;math&gt;i \approx r + \pi&lt;/math&gt;


As a consequence of an increase in ''π'' the nominal interest rate ''i'' will increase (Fisher effect). That in turn will increase the opportunity costs to keep cash. Hence, higher inflation causes higher opportunity costs. [[File:lossinutilityofmoney.PNG‎|frame|x150px|Relation: real money demand, nominal interest rates (user cost) and utility.]]
In order to circumvent these costs people renounce to keep cash and in that manner the money's utility as a medium of exchange decreases. If people anticipate the inflation, that means higher values for ''i'', then they will automatically reduce the amount of cash they keep.

In the graphic to the right the utility is depicted by the area below the graph. The lower ''i'' gets, the bigger the area becomes. With ''i = r'' the sum of both areas, the orange and the red one, indicates the total utility of liquidity preference. The area gets larger as ''i'' decreases and because the user cost decreases people are more likely to keep cash than to deposit it. As a consequence more cash is in circulation, money increasingly serves as the medium of exchange. 
What the graphic also shows is the theoretically optimal rate of inflation: 


&lt;math&gt;i = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;r + \pi = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;r = -\pi&lt;/math&gt;


Money has the highest utility when ''i'' is equal to 0. ''i'' is equal to ''pi + r'' and ''r'' needs to be positive all the time because otherwise people would not deposit any money. Therefore ''π'' must be negative. Conclusion: the theoretically optimal rate of inflation is a deflation.

To summarize it: Anticipated inflation causes people to deposit their money instead of keeping it as cash. By depositing the money people aim at earning an interest ''i'' that compensates for the anticipated inflation. People will do so because to not deposit the money when inflation is anticipated causes costs equal to ''i''. People do not get the real interest rate ''r'', which they could always earn, and they do not get ''π'', a compensation for inflation. The utility of money for the individual decreases as the user costs to keep cash, in order to be able to consummate transactions, increase.

=== Menu Costs ===

The starting point for the argument of menu costs is the money's function as a unit of account. The term menu cost is derived from the metaphor of a menu card in a restaurant. Inflation would make it necessary to print new menu cards very often, resulting in additional costs. 

However, the term menu cost does not only refer to menu cards, but also to all other things where regular price adjustments cause additional costs. That includes new wage negotiations, the adjustment of machines and the printing of new banknotes among others. The higher inflation is, the higher the fixed costs of price adjustments become. In extreme cases, if inflation is too high, money might lose its function as a unit of account.

In theory, indexation could be used as a countermeasure against menu costs, but in reality it is ineffective because never will all prices be linked to a price index. Either because people fail to do so or because before all would had done so, a currency reform would have been consummated. 

=== Bracket Creep and Oliveira-Tanzi Effect ===

The term '''bracket creep''' describes a phenomenon of taxation that occurs due to inflation. Because of inflation nominal wages increase and people get into higher tax brackets. That results in indirect costs because, although the nominal wages increase, in terms of real wages, nothing changes. The increase of the general price level neutralizes the increase of the nominal wage, but because tax brackets are not corrected for inflation, people will have to pay more taxes although their real purchasing power did not change.

With regard to taxation the '''Oliveira-Tanzi effect''' describes the devaluation of tax revenues due to the delay that occurs between the determination of taxes and the eventual payment. If the tax for something was 100$ last year and the rate of inflation up to now was 10%, then the government's real revenue will be 90$ instead of 100$.

== Costs of Inflation: Inflation Uncertainties ==

=== The Risk Premium ===
[[File:Capitalmarketinefficiency.PNG||frame|x150px|The risk premium shifts the Credit Supply upwards, making it more expensive to borrow than in the equilibrium. ]]
In times of uncertainty regarding the monetary development capital suppliers often add a risk premium to the interest they would like to charge. The risk premium is supposed to compensate for possible inflationary developments that could potentially disadvantage the capital suppliers. That makes credits more expensive and in turn fewer credits are demanded. Due to the risk premium the price for credits is never in its natural equilibrium and consequently the market efficiency decreases.

=== Volatility of Inflation ===

Empirical evidence suggests that there exists a relation between the rate of inflation and the volatility of inflation: The higher the average rate of inflation, the higher is its volatility. Example: If a country A has an average rate of inflation of approximately 3%, it might happen that the rate of inflation sometimes tends to be 1% or even 0% and sometimes a bit higher, like 5%. However it is very unlikely that country A will ever have inflation rates of 10% or 20%. In contrast to country A, country B has an average rate of inflation of 30%. When inflation has reached such a high level, it is inconceivable that inflation always fluctuates around 30% with rates of for example 28% or 33%. Instead the variance is much higher, country B could probably have inflation rates of 5% or 60%. 
[[File:volatilityofinflation.PNG||frame|x150px|The higher the rate of inflation, the higher the volatility of inflation becomes.]]
A possible explanation for this phenomenon is government intervention. Whether the government decides to take countermeasures against inflation or not can influence the expectations of inflation significantly. If the government decides to take countermeasures it depends on its success whether inflation rates decrease or if the situation even deteriorates. Therefore the result can vary tremendously and cause such great volatilities.

=== Redistribution between Creditors and Debtors ===

The last cost to be mentioned here is the hazard of possible redistributions of wealth. Due to inflation the creditors are disadvantaged because the real value of their receivables decreases. Vice versa debtors are advantaged because inflation reduces the real value of the debts. The higher the rate of inflation the more significant the effect of redistribution becomes. In case of hyperinflation it might cause creditors to lose all their assets because their receivables need to be paid with monetary units. In contrast, if the debtors used the money to buy assets the values of which are not subject to inflation, then it is called redistribution of wealth. The risk premium (see above) mirrors the uncertainty of creditors of such a loss.

== Summary and Conclusion ==

In this chapter the costs of inflation, either anticipated or unexpected, were examined. It should become clear that inflation can cause high costs and that it is in the best interest of the people to keep inflation moderate. Therefore it is monetary policy's and consequently the central bank's primary concern to maintain price stability. If inflation arises once in an otherwise fairly stable economy, it is not so tremendously bad, but if it happens twice people might lose their confidence and the government might lose its credibility. It is worth mentioning at this point that the monetary system is based on trust and if people lose that trust, if their expectations about inflation are bad, it can cause severe damages to the economy.

The economic output plays a role too. In the short-run monetary policy can influence the output, that is why central banks usually do flexible inflation targeting instead of strict inflation targeting. It is the willingness to make compromises as long as it does not force the central bank to deviate from its goal of price stability, as a central bank that only pretends to be interested in price stability is not trustworthy. The distrust results in bad expectations and these could have serious repercussions for the economy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I subdivided the Monetary Policy part. Furthermore I corrected the status of chapters that were obviously written some years ago. They seem to be incomplete and the focus of the book does not seem clear to me. The table of contents suggests a strong theoretical approach, whereas, what I saw when scanning it, the &quot;Economic Uses of Money&quot; page suggests a more practical approach, because there is no theoretical breakdown of money as a medium of exchange or a store of value, although the latter is mentioned in the assets chapter. It all seems fairly messy to me and it should be revised. &lt;br&gt;

0. INTRODUCTION
---------------

A number of people have asked me to explain Amiga device drivers to them.
There is a lot to explain, and so I decided to write down all I know about
the subject.  Here is the result.

This is not a standalone document.  It assumes that you are familiar with
Amiga programming at the multiple task, message passing level.  It assumes
that you have the autodocs, include files, and the example device driver
from Commodore.  A lot of information from these documents is duplicated,
but not all.

I wish that I knew more about this subject than I do and that I was a better
writer.  Alas, I don't and I'm not.  This document contains all you need to
write a disk resident, autoloading and expungeable device driver, but you
may have to read it more than once.  To write a good, removeable-media disk
driver, you will have to do some additional research.


1. DEVICE STRUCTURE
-------------------

This section describes the data structure associated with a loaded device,
and how to get a device into the system.  As far as discussed in this
section, libraries and devices are identical.


1.1. DEVICE NODES

A device is known to the system by its device node.  The device node
consists of three parts:

    (a) a jump table to the device functions
    (b) a library structure
    (c) any private data that the device has

The &quot;device address&quot; is the base address of the library node; thus the
jump table is at negative offsets from the address, and everything else
is at positive offsets.

Each entry in the jump table is a &quot;jmp&quot; to a 32-bit address.  Thus the
first jump is at offset -6 from the device address, the second at offset
-12, and so forth.  The following four are standard for all devices and
libraries:

    -6: Open
   -12: Close
   -18: Expunge
   -24: ExtFunc

These are the entry points for opening, closing, and expunging (unloading)
the device, respectively.  The last one appears to be for future expansion.

Device drivers have two more standard functions:

   -30: BeginIO
   -36: AbortIO

These are the entry points for submitting an I/O request and cancelling a
pending one, respectively.

The library structure is shown below in &quot;unwound&quot; form.

    struct Library {
        struct  Node {
            struct  Node *ln_Succ;
            struct  Node *ln_Pred;
            UBYTE   ln_Type;
                /*  NT_DEVICE = 3  */
            BYTE    ln_Pri;
            char    *ln_Name;
        } lib_Node;
        UBYTE   lib_Flags;
                /*  LIBF_SUMMING = 1
                    LIBF_CHANGED = 2
                    LIBF_SUMUSED = 4
                    LIBF_DELEXP  = 8  */
        UBYTE   lib_pad;
        UWORD   lib_NegSize;
        UWORD   lib_PosSize;
        UWORD   lib_Version;
        UWORD   lib_Revision;
        APTR    lib_IdString;
        ULONG   lib_Sum;
        UWORD   lib_OpenCnt;
    };

The device is chained on the system device list by the node structure at
the top.  The device list can be found at ExecBase-&gt;DeviceList.  Of
interest is the &quot;ln_Type&quot; field, which must be NT_DEVICE, and the
&quot;ln_Name&quot; field, which must be the device name in standard form, such
as &quot;serial.device&quot;.

The &quot;lib_PosSize&quot; and &quot;lib_NegSize&quot; fields indicate the number of bytes
used above and below the device base address.  Thus &quot;lib_NegSize&quot; is
the size of the jump vector, and &quot;lib_PosSize&quot; is the size of the library
structure plus the user's private data, if any.

&quot;lib_Version&quot;, &quot;lib_Revision&quot;, and &quot;lib_IdString&quot; store more information
about the device.  For &quot;serial.device&quot;, version 34, revision 12, the
string would look like this:

    &quot;serial 34.12 (27 Mar 1989)&quot;

This appears to be the accepted standard format.

The &quot;lib_Sum&quot; field, along with the flag bits &quot;LIBF_SUMMING&quot;,
&quot;LIBF_CHANGED&quot;, and &quot;LIBF_SUMUSED&quot; are for the jump vector checksum
mechanism, which is discussed farther on.

The &quot;lib_OpenCnt&quot; field counts the number of times that the
device is currently open.  If this is not zero and an expunge is
requested, the device can use the &quot;LIBF_DELEXP&quot; flag to remember that
it should disappear at the earliest opportunity.


1.2. CONSTRUCTING A DEVICE NODE

In theory, you could just allocate all the memory needed for the device
node, manually initialize the jump vector and the required fields in the
library node, get ExecBase-&gt;DeviceList, do a Forbid(), and add the node
to the list using Enqueue(), AddHead(), or AddTail().  But there is an
easier way.  It is the following function:

    AddDevice(device)
              A1

This takes an initialized device node, does the Forbid()/Permit(), and
adds the node to ExecBase-&gt;DeviceList.  It also calls Sumkick() (discussed
later).  The node itself can be constructed with this function:

    library = MakeLibrary(vectors, structure, init, dataSize, segList)
    D0                    A0       A1         A2    D0        D1

The first parameter points to the table of function addresses for the
jump vector.  It can have one of the following formats:

    (a) Relative

        vectors: dc.w   -1
                 dc.w   func1-vectors
                 dc.w   func2-vectors
                 ...
                 dc.w   -1

    (b) Absolute

        vectors: dc.l   func1
                 dc.l   func2
                 ...
                 dc.l   -1

The &quot;dataSize&quot; parameter determines &quot;positive size&quot; of the device node.
It must be at least the size of a library structure.  The &quot;negative
size&quot; is implicit from the number of jump vector entries supplied.

The &quot;MakeLibrary&quot; function will allocate the appropriate amount of memory,
fill in the jump vector, then use InitStruct() to clear and initialize
the positive offset area.  The &quot;structure&quot; parameter points to a data
table for the InitStruct() function.  This function is a complex thing,
best used with the macros supplied.  Below is the table in Commodore's
example device driver:

    dataTable:
       INITBYTE   LN_TYPE,NT_DEVICE
       INITLONG   LN_NAME,myName
       INITBYTE   LIB_FLAGS,LIBF_SUMUSED!LIBF_CHANGED
       INITWORD   LIB_VERSION,VERSION
       INITWORD   LIB_REVISION,REVISION
       INITLONG   LIB_IDSTRING,idString
       DC.L   0

It means this:

       - store a byte NT_DEVICE at offset LN_TYPE
       - store the device name as a longword (pointer) at LN_NAME
       - store LIBF_SUMUSED!LIBF_CHANGED in the &quot;lib_Flags&quot; field
       - store the version, revision, and IdString in the appropriate fields.

If you want to know more about the Initstruct() function (which is very
flexible and can do more than suggested above), you should read the autodoc
for it and possibly the disassembly as well.

Finally, we have the &quot;init&quot; and &quot;segList&quot; parameters.  &quot;init&quot; is the
address of the device's own initialization code.  This is called after
construction of the node is complete.  &quot;segList&quot; describes where the device's
code is loaded.  The initialization code is called with the device node
address in D0 and the SegList parameter in A0.  The value it returns
is the value returned by MakeLibrary.  Thus the initialization code
will normally return the device node address as it received it.

The only remaining thing to note is that the &quot;structure&quot; and &quot;init&quot; fields
can be set to zero to not initialize the positive offset area and not
call any initialization code, respectively.

So to summarize what we have so far, the first-principles way to get a device
into the system is the following:

    - LoadSeg() the code into memory, if necessary
    - MakeLibrary() to build the library node
    - AddDevice() with the result to add the node to the device list.


1.3. STANDARD DEVICE FORMAT

Real devices are in a standard format, which allows them to be loaded
and initialized without any knowledge of their internals.  The standard
format is based on a &quot;resident structure&quot;, or &quot;RomTag&quot;.  Such structures
tag the various libraries and devices in the system ROM and in the LIBS:
and DEVS: directories on disk.  The structure is the following:

    struct Resident {
        UWORD rt_MatchWord;
                /*  RTC_MATCHWORD = 0x4AFC  */
        struct Resident *rt_MatchTag;
        APTR  rt_EndSkip;
        UBYTE rt_Flags;
                /*  RTF_COLDSTART = 1
                    RTF_AUTOINIT  = 128 */
        UBYTE rt_Version;
        UBYTE rt_Type;
                /*  NT_DEVICE = 3 */
        BYTE  rt_Pri;
        char  *rt_Name;
        char  *rt_IdString;
        APTR  rt_Init;
    };

The first two fields are special, allowing the structure to be found
during a ROM scan.  They are the official 68000 &quot;illegal instruction&quot;,
opcode 0x4AFC, followed by a pointer to the instruction.  The next field
speeds up the ROM scan by pointing to the address at which the scan
should continue, usually at the end of the area tagged by this RomTag.

The &quot;rt_Version&quot; field has the familiar version number, and the &quot;rt_Type&quot;
field is NT_DEVICE for our application.  The &quot;rt_Pri&quot; field, together
with the &quot;rt_Version&quot; field, determines which of multiple modules with
the same name will be accepted, should such a situation occur.  The
&quot;rt_Name&quot; and &quot;rt_IdString&quot; fields identify the module; they should be
set to the device name and IdString as discussed earlier for a device
node.

Things tagged by RomTags are referred to as &quot;resident modules&quot;, and
are initialized like this:

    InitResident(resident, segList)
                 A1        D1

Here, &quot;resident&quot; points to the RomTag, and &quot;segList&quot; identifies the
code associated with it (this is optional).

The InitResident() function first checks if the RTF_AUTOINIT flag is
set in the RomTag.  If it is not, it simply calls the routine pointed to
by &quot;rt_Init&quot; with A0 containing the value passed as &quot;segList&quot;, and
returns.

If the RTF_AUTOINIT flag is set, then the function does all the device
initialization work for you.  In this case, &quot;rt_Init&quot; points to a data
table of four longwords, containing these parameters for the &quot;MakeLibrary&quot;
function:

    - dataSize
    - vectors
    - structure
    - init

InitResident calls the MakeLibrary function with these values, plus the
obligatory &quot;segList&quot; parameter.  Unless MakeLibrary() returns null, the
new library node is now added to the appropriate system list, based on
the &quot;ln_Type&quot; field in the node.  If it is NT_DEVICE, the node is added
to the device list, which is what we want.

You should now have enough information to create a standard device header
and initialization function, and to understand the one in Commodore's
example device driver.


1.4. DEVICES IN ROM

Devices in ROM are found during a scan of the entire ROM for RomTag
structures.  This occurs at boot time.  The RomTags which are found
are added to the resident module list in ExecBase.  All those whose
RTF_COLDSTART flag is set are automatically started up with InitResident().

Modules can be &quot;ramkicked&quot; using a mechanism which I will not describe
here.  This causes them to survive a reset, be found in RAM, and be
initialized along with the ROM modules at cold start time.  This is how
the RAD: bootable RAM disk works.


1.5. DEVICES ON DISK

Devices on disk reside in the DEVS: directory.  They are standard object
modules, and loaded with LoadSeg().  After they have been loaded, the
first hunk of the seglist is scanned for a RomTag, and the device is
initialized with an InitResident().  When building a disk resident device,
be careful that the linker does not add a dummy hunk at the front of your
code (old versions of BLINK do this), as this would cause your RomTag not
to be found.


1.6. JUMP VECTOR CHECKSUMS

The &quot;lib_Sum&quot; field in the library structure can be used to hold a checksum
of the jump vector, to guard against accidental or unauthorized
modification.  The &quot;LIBF_SUMUSED&quot; flag bit indicates that this should be
done.  The &quot;LIBF_CHANGED&quot; flag bit indicates that the jump vector has
been modified and the checksum is invalid.  The following function
implements the mechanism:

    SumLibrary(library)
               A1

This does the following:

    IF the LIBF_SUMUSED flag is set THEN
        Forbid()
        IF the LIBF_CHANGED flag is set THEN
            Compute checksum and store in lib_Sum
            Clear the LIBF_CHANGED flag
        ELSE
            IF the lib_Sum field is zero THEN
                Compute checksum and store in lib_Sum
            ELSE
                Compute checksum
                IF checksum does not match lib_Sum THEN
                    Put up recoverable alert #81000003
                    Store new checksum in lib_Sum
                ENDIF
            ENDIF
        ENDIF
        Permit()
    ENDIF

Thus when creating a new device node, it is best to set the LIBF_SUMUSED
and LIBF_CHANGED bits, so that the first call to SumLibrary() updates the
checksum and future calls detect modifications to the jump vector.

The system sets the LIBF_CHANGED bit and calls SumLibrary() as part of the
SetFunction() call to keep the checksum valid.


2. DEVICE I/O PROTOCOL
----------------------

This section describes the interface to a device once it is loaded and
initialized.


2.1. THE I/O REQUEST STRUCTURE

The system communicates with a device driver by use of an &quot;I/O Request&quot;
structure.  The most common version of this is shown below, but all
fields after the &quot;io_Error&quot; field are device driver specific and may
be omitted or redefined.

    struct IOStdReq {
        struct  Message {
            struct  Node {
                struct  Node *ln_Succ;
                struct  Node *ln_Pred;
                UBYTE   ln_Type;
                        /*  NT_MESSAGE  = 5
                            NT_REPLYMSG = 7 */
                BYTE    ln_Pri;
                char    *ln_Name;
            } mn_Node;
            struct  MsgPort *mn_ReplyPort;
            UWORD   mn_Length;
        } io_Message;
        struct  Device  *io_Device;
        struct  Unit    *io_Unit;
        UWORD   io_Command;
        UBYTE   io_Flags;
                /*  IOF_QUICK = 1 */
        BYTE    io_Error;
        ULONG   io_Actual;
        ULONG   io_Length;
        APTR    io_Data;
        ULONG   io_Offset;
    };

The first field in the I/O request is a standard message structure,
allowing it to be enqueued on message ports and replied to.  The
&quot;io_Device&quot; field points to the device structure, and the &quot;io_Unit&quot;
field points to a &quot;unit&quot; structure maintained by the device driver
for each functional unit (e.g. disk drive).  Thus these two fields
identify the target of the I/O request.


2.2. OPENING AND CLOSING A DEVICE

To communicate with a device, one needs at least one I/O request,
and a message port to which the device can return I/O requests which
it has finished processing.  These are easily created using the following
two C library functions:

    MyPort = CreatePort( name, pri )
    struct MsgPort *MyPort;
    char *name;
    BYTE pri;

    ioStdReq = CreateStdIO( ioReplyPort )
    struct IOStdReq *ioStdReq;
    struct MsgPort *ioReplyPort;

The first function creates a message port and associated signal bit, and
returns the address of the port.  The second function creates an IOStdReq
structure, fills in the address of the reply port, and returns the
address of the structure.  Then the device driver can be opened using
this function:

    error = OpenDevice(devName, unitNumber, iORequest, flags)
    D0                 A0       D0          A1         D1

The parameters are the name of the device (e.g. &quot;trackdisk.device&quot;, the
unit number (e.g. 0 for the internal drive), the address of the finished
I/O request structure, and a &quot;flags&quot; word containing special information
for the device driver.  The following C code will open the trackdisk
driver for the internal drive, and close it again:

    /*
     *  Do not supply a name for the message port, since supplying a name
     *  will put it on the public message port list.
     */
    td_mp = CreatePort(0L,0L);
    if(!td_mp) exit(99);
    td_iob = CreateStdIO(td_mp);
    if(!td_iob) {
        DeletePort(td_mp);
        exit(99);
    }
    if(OpenDevice(&quot;trackdisk.device&quot;,0L,td_iob,0L)) {
        printf(&quot;Unable to open floppy device driver.\n&quot;);
        DeleteStdIO(td_iob);
        DeletePort(td_mp);
        exit(99);
    }

    /*
     *  I/O request is ready for operations here.
     */

    CloseDevice(td_iob);
    DeleteStdIO(td_iob);
    DeletePort(td_mp);

OpenDevice() and CloseDevice() are exec functions, but are intercepted by
something called &quot;ramlib.library&quot;, which handles the loading and unloading
of disk resident devices and libraries.  Thus the OpenDevice() call may
cause the device to be loaded and initialized, and the CloseDevice() may
cause it to be unloaded.

The OpenDevice() eventually results in the initialized device driver being
called through its Open() function (at offset -6 in the jump vector).
This occurs in the context (task) of the calling program.  The device driver
is passed the following information:

    D0:  Unit number
    D1:  Flags
    A1:  I/O request pointer
    A6:  Device node pointer

The exec will have already cleared the &quot;io_Error&quot; field in the I/O request,
and stored the device node pointer in the &quot;io_Device&quot; field.

If the Open() function succeeds, it must initialize the &quot;io_Unit&quot; field
for later uses of the I/O request.  If it fails, it must set the
&quot;io_Error&quot; field to the appropriate number.  The value of the &quot;io_Error&quot;
field on exit is returned by the OpenDevice() function.

The device driver should keep track of the number of outstanding opens
using the &quot;lib_OpenCnt&quot; field in its device node.  Some device drivers
can support an arbitrary number of concurrent opens (e.g. disk drivers),
while others can be opened in &quot;exclusive access&quot; modes (e.g. serial ports).

The unit number and flags are two 32-bit words whose format is up to
the device driver writer.  For an example unit numbering scheme, see
the include file &quot;devices/scsidisk.h&quot;, and for some example uses of the
flag bits, see &quot;devices/serial.h&quot;.

The CloseDevice() call eventually results in the device driver being
called through its Close() function, at offset -12 in the jump vector.
The I/O request pointer is passed in A1, and the device node pointer in
A6.  The return value determines what happens with the closed device.
If it is zero, the device is kept around.   If it is non-zero, it means
that the device has performed a delayed expunge and wishes to be unloaded.
In this case, the return value is the &quot;segList&quot; parameter which was passed
to the device at initialization time.  More of this in the next section.


2.3. EXPUNGING A DEVICE

A device can be deleted from the system using this function:

    error = RemDevice(device)
    D0                A1

The system may issue this function itself, if it runs out of memory and
tries to reclaim space.  Either way, the device is called through its
Expunge() entry point, at offset -18 in the jump vector.  Register A6
is set up to point to the device node.

The device should now shut down its activity, i.e. remove interrupt
servers, deallocate buffers, and so on.  Then it should unlink its
device node from the device list, and deallocate the node, thus restoring
things to the state they were in just before it was started up with
InitResident().  Finally, it should return the &quot;segList&quot; parameter which
was passed to it at initialization time.  If the device came from disk,
the system will use this to unload its code.

If the device is not idle when the Expunge() call arrives, it can defer the
operation.  To do this, it sets the LIBF_DELEXP flag in the library
structure, and returns zero.  This indicates that it will delete itself
at the earliest opportunity.  When the last Close() call arrives, it
will shut itself down just as described above, and return the segList
value to indicate that it has done so and should be unloaded.


2.4. UNIT STRUCTURES

Many device drivers manage more than one functional unit.  For example,
the trackdisk driver can handle up to four floppy drives.  The preferred
approach is to use a separate &quot;Unit&quot; structure for each functional unit
(e.g. drive).  Normally, a unit structure consists of at least the following:

    struct Unit {
        struct  MsgPort unit_MsgPort;
        UBYTE   unit_flags;
                /*  UNITF_ACTIVE = 1
                    UNITF_INTASK = 2 */
        UBYTE   unit_pad;
        UWORD   unit_OpenCnt;
    };

When the device driver is opened, it uses the unit number to select the
appropriate unit structure, and stores the pointer to this structure in
the I/O request.  Later, it can queue up pending I/O requests on the
message port for processing by the unit task.


2.5. THE BEGINIO FUNCTION

All I/O requests enter the device driver through the BeginIO() function
in its jump vector.  The device driver is entered in the context of the
requesting task, with A6 pointing to the device node and A1 pointing to
the I/O request structure.

Normally, the device driver will now use PutMsg() to enqueue the I/O
request on a message port (in a Unit structure) for processing by an
internal task.  Then it can return from the BeginIO() function.  When
the exec checks to see if the I/O request is completed yet, it checks
its type field, and if it is NT_MESSAGE (as results from the PutMsg()
call) it knows that it is still in progress.  Eventually, the internal
task receives the I/O request, operates on it, and does a ReplyMsg().
This returns the I/O request to the caller's reply port, and also sets
its type to NT_REPLYMSG, signaling that it is finished.

It is clear that the device driver does not have to follow this procedure
exactly.  Short commands (such as checking if a disk is ready) can just
be done immediately, in the caller's context.  The I/O request must simply
be returned with ReplyMsg() at the end, and its type field must be
something other than NT_REPLYMSG if the BeginIO() function returns with
the I/O request not completed yet.

A special case of I/O processing is signaled by the IOF_QUICK flag.  When
it is set, it means that the requester has used the DoIO() function, and
thus will be doing nothing until the I/O is complete.  In this case, the
device driver can run the whole I/O operation in the caller's context and
return immediately.  Message passing and task switch overhead is eliminated.
When the BeginIO() function returns with the IOF_QUICK bit still set, it
means that the I/O operation is complete.

If the device driver sees the IOF_QUICK flag set but cannot perform the
I/O processing inline, it can simply clear the flag and return the I/O
request with ReplyMsg() as usual.

The BeginIO() function operates on the command and parameters in the I/O
request, and sets the &quot;io_Error&quot; field to indicate the result.  The exec
I/O functions return the value of this field to the caller; BeginIO() itself
does not return a value.  &quot;io_Error&quot; set to zero means that no error has
occurred.


2.6. THE ABORTIO FUNCTION

Some device driver operations, such as waiting for a timeout or input on
a serial port, may need to be aborted before they complete.  The AbortIO()
function is provided for this.  The device driver is entered through its
AbortIO() entry point with the address of the I/O request to be aborted
in A1, and the device node pointer in A6.  If the device driver determines
that the I/O request is indeed in progress and can successfully abort it,
it returns zero, otherwise it returns a non-zero error code.

A successfully aborted I/O request is returned by the normal method, i.e.
ReplyMsg().  The &quot;io_Error&quot; field should indicate that it did not complete
normally.


2.7. EXEC I/O FUNCTIONS

The following primitives are provided for communicating with device
drivers.  It is assumed that the driver has been opened with OpenDevice()
and an initialized I/O request exists.

    SendIO(iORequest)
           A1

This function calls the BeginIO() entry point in the device driver with
IOF_QUICK clear.  This means that the device driver should return the I/O
request with ReplyMsg().

    error = DoIO(iORequest)
    D0           A1

This function calls the BeginIO() entry point in the device driver with
IOF_QUICK set.  If the device driver leaves IOF_QUICK set, it returns to
the caller immediately.  The return value is the extended value of the
&quot;io_Error&quot; field in the I/O request.  If the IOF_QUICK bit is cleared,
it falls through to WaitIO().

    error = WaitIO(iORequest)
    D0             A1

This function waits for an I/O request to complete.  If the I/O request
has the IOF_QUICK flag set, it cannot possibly be in progress, so it
returns immediately.  Otherwise, the I/O request will be returned with
ReplyMsg(), and the function proceeds as follows:

    Get the signal number from the I/O request's reply port
    Disable()
    WHILE iORequest-&gt;io_Message.mn_Node.ln_Type != NT_REPLYMSG DO
        Wait() for the reply port signal
    ENDWHILE
    Unlink the I/O request from the reply port's message queue
    Enable()

Finally, it returns &quot;io_Error&quot; from the I/O request, extended to a
longword, as usual.

    result = CheckIO(iORequest)
    D0               A1

This function checks if the indicated I/O request is complete.  It is
considered complete if its IOF_QUICK bit is set, or if its type is
NT_REPLYMSG.  In this case, the function returns the address of the I/O
request.  If the I/O request is not complete, it returns zero.  This
function does not dequeue the I/O request from the reply port.

    error = AbortIO(iORequest)
    D0              A1

This function calls the AbortIO() entry point in the device driver, as
discussed earlier.


2.8. CALLING BEGINIO DIRECTLY

There is one operation which DoIO() and SendIO() cannot handle, and that
is sending an I/O request with the IOF_QUICK flag set, but not waiting
for it to complete.  That is &quot;run this as quickly as possible but if it's
going to take a while, don't wait for it&quot;.  For this operation, the
user must set IOF_QUICK manually, then call the device driver directly
through its BeginIO() entry point.  The following C library function
will do the latter:

    void BeginIO( ioRequest )
    struct IOStdReq *ioRequest;

Since WaitIO() and CheckIO() know about the IOF_QUICK flag, I/O requests
submitted this way can be processed by WaitIO() and CheckIO() as usual.


2.8. SYNCHRONOUS I/O

Synchronous I/O is done when the caller does not wish to continue until
the I/O operation is complete.  In this case, the caller just sets up
the I/O request and does a DoIO() on it.  When DoIO() returns, the I/O
is complete.


2.9. ASYNCHRONOUS I/O

Asynchronous I/O is done when the caller wishes to submit an I/O request
and then do other things while it completes.  Such I/O is submitted by
SendIO() or BeginIO() as discussed earlier.  There are a variety of ways
to wait for completion of an asynchronous I/O request; several are discussed
below.


2.9.1. WAITING FOR A SPECIFIC I/O REQUEST

Waiting for just one specific I/O request is done with the WaitIO()
function.  The function will not return until that particular I/O request
is completed.


2.9.2. WAITING ON A SPECIFIC REPLY PORT

If a number of I/O requests are outstanding and all will arrive at the
same reply port, then the following can be used:

    WHILE I/O requests are outstanding DO
        WaitPort() on the port
        GetMsg() on the port
    ENDWHILE


2.9.3. GENERAL CASE

Often, a program will be waiting for one of a number of events to occur,
and the only thing these events have in common is that they will set a
signal.  Then the program must get the signal bits from all the I/O reply
ports, merge them with the other signal bits to wait for, and do a Wait()
on the result.  When the Wait() returns with a signal bit set which
corresponds to an I/O reply port, then a GetMsg() can be attempted on
that port to see if an I/O operation has completed.  In this manner,
I/O completions can be handled together with other events in any order.


3. GENERIC COMMAND AND ERROR NUMBERS
------------------------------------

This section lists the command and error numbers which are predefined
in the Amiga system for all types of device drivers.


3.1. COMMANDS

The command number is stored in the &quot;io_Command&quot; field of the I/O request.
The generic command numbers, as found in the include file &quot;exec/io.h&quot;, are as
follows:

    #define CMD_INVALID 0
    #define CMD_RESET   1
    #define CMD_READ    2
    #define CMD_WRITE   3
    #define CMD_UPDATE  4
    #define CMD_CLEAR   5
    #define CMD_STOP    6
    #define CMD_START   7
    #define CMD_FLUSH   8

    #define CMD_NONSTD  9

It is seen that command number zero is invalid, and command numbers greater
than 9 are custom defined.  The remaining commands are as follows:


3.1.1. CMD_RESET

This resets the device to a known initial state.  Pending I/O requests not
processed at the time of this command should be returned with an error.


3.1.2. CMD_READ

This requests that &quot;io_Length&quot; items of data be read from location
&quot;io_Offset&quot; on the unit, and stored at &quot;io_Data&quot; in the caller's memory.
The actual amount of data transferred is returned in &quot;io_Actual&quot;.  The
specifics depend on the device type.


3.1.3. CMD_WRITE

This requests that data be transferred from the caller's memory
to the I/O unit.  The arguments are the same as for CMD_READ.


3.1.4. CMD_UPDATE

This requests that all buffered, but unwritten data be forced out
to the I/O unit.  It might write out the track buffer in a disk device,
for example.


3.1.5. CMD_CLEAR

This requests that all data buffered by the device for the given unit
be invalidated.  Thus, for example, it would throw away data waiting in a
serial input buffer.


3.1.6. CMD_STOP

This requests that the unit stop processing commands.  I/O requests not
processed at the time of the CMD_STOP will wait until a CMD_START or
CMD_RESET is received or they are aborted.


3.1.7. CMD_START

This requests that the unit clear a CMD_STOP condition and resume processing
commands.  Only one CMD_START is required, regardless of how many CMD_STOPs
have been received.


3.1.8. CMD_FLUSH

This requests that the unit flush all pending commands.  All I/O requests
queued but not yet processed should be sent back with an error.


3.2. ERROR NUMBERS

The include file &quot;exec/errors.h&quot; lists the following standard error numbers.

    #define IOERR_OPENFAIL  -1  /* device/unit failed to open */
    #define IOERR_ABORTED   -2  /* request aborted */
    #define IOERR_NOCMD     -3  /* command not supported */
    #define IOERR_BADLENGTH -4  /* not a valid length */


4. DISK DEVICE DRIVERS
----------------------

Real device drivers usually support more commands than those listed in
section 3.  This section describes the command set used by disk device
drivers.  This information is needed to write a disk driver compatible
with the existing file systems and disk repair programs.

All &quot;normal&quot; disk commands use an I/O request of the structure given earlier.
The &quot;extended&quot; trackdisk commands, which use a larger I/O request, are not
discussed.


4.1. COMMANDS

The include file &quot;devices/trackdisk.h&quot; lists the following command numbers:

    #define TD_MOTOR        (CMD_NONSTD+0)      /*  9 */
    #define TD_SEEK         (CMD_NONSTD+1)      /* 10 */
    #define TD_FORMAT       (CMD_NONSTD+2)      /* 11 */
    #define TD_REMOVE       (CMD_NONSTD+3)      /* 12 */
    #define TD_CHANGENUM    (CMD_NONSTD+4)      /* 13 */
    #define TD_CHANGESTATE  (CMD_NONSTD+5)      /* 14 */
    #define TD_PROTSTATUS   (CMD_NONSTD+6)      /* 15 */
    #define TD_RAWREAD      (CMD_NONSTD+7)      /* 16 */
    #define TD_RAWWRITE     (CMD_NONSTD+8)      /* 17 */
    #define TD_GETDRIVETYPE (CMD_NONSTD+9)      /* 18 */
    #define TD_GETNUMTRACKS (CMD_NONSTD+10)     /* 19 */
    #define TD_ADDCHANGEINT (CMD_NONSTD+11)     /* 20 */
    #define TD_REMCHANGEINT (CMD_NONSTD+12)     /* 21 */

Some of these commands are specific to removeable media and/or the
trackdisk.device and need not be supported by a hard disk driver.  More
on this later.  The following sections describe the individual commands.


4.1.1. CMD_READ AND CMD_WRITE

These are generic commands, but the details are specific to the type of
device.  For disk devices, the &quot;io_Length&quot; and &quot;io_Offset&quot; fields must
be an exact multiple of the sector size supported by the device.  At
present, this is 512 bytes.  The &quot;io_Actual&quot; field could conceivably
return a different value from &quot;io_Length&quot; if an error stopped the operation
part way through.


4.1.2. TD_MOTOR

This command turns the floppy disk motor on and off.  &quot;io_Length&quot; should
be set to zero to turn it off, or one to turn it on.  &quot;io_Actual&quot; will
return the previous state of the motor.  The motor will turn on automatically
as required, but never off again; thus, the user must issue a TD_MOTOR
command to turn it off.


4.1.3. TD_SEEK

This command moves the read/write heads to the position indicated in
&quot;io_Offset&quot;, which must be an exact multiple of the sector size.  Seeking
is implied in other commands, but this command can be used to &quot;pre-seek&quot;
the device if the needed position is known in advance of the
read/write operation.


4.1.4. TD_FORMAT

This command takes the same arguments and performs the same operation as
CMD_WRITE, with the following two exceptions:

    (a) The area to be written must be a formattable unit, i.e. in the
        trackdisk.device it must be one or more complete tracks.

    (b) The area is written with the data regardless of its previous
        contents; it need not already be formatted.

This describes the observed behaviour of the trackdisk.device.  The autodoc
for &quot;TD_FORMAT&quot; disagrees with this information.

Hard disk drivers typically implement TD_FORMAT as a simple call to
CMD_WRITE.  This allows the hard disk to be &quot;high level formatted&quot; with
the AmigaDOS &quot;format&quot; command.

Some ancient SASI/SCSI disk controller boards have a &quot;format track&quot; command,
so a driver targeted specifically at them could implement TD_FORMAT the
same way as the trackdisk.device does.


4.1.5. TD_PROTSTATUS

If there is a disk in the drive, this command returns &quot;io_Actual&quot; set to
zero if the disk is writeable, nonzero if protected.  If there is no disk,
the I/O request returns with the &quot;io_Error&quot; set to &quot;TDERR_DiskChanged&quot;.


4.1.6. TD_RAWREAD AND TD_RAWWRITE

These commands read and write whole tracks of raw MFM data on the
trackdisk.device.  Refer to the autodocs for detailed information.


4.1.7. TD_GETDRIVETYPE

This command is trackdisk.device specific, and returns the type of disk
drive in &quot;io_Actual&quot;.  This is one of the following:

    1:  3.5&quot;, 80 track drive
    2:  5.25&quot;, 40 track drive


4.1.8. TD_GETNUMTRACKS

This command is trackdisk.device specific, and returns the number of tracks
on the disk unit in &quot;io_Actual&quot;.


4.1.9. TD_CHANGESTATE

This command checks to see if there is a disk in a removable-media drive.
It returns &quot;io_Actual&quot; set to zero if there is, nonzero if there is not.


4.1.10. OTHER COMMANDS

The remaining commands are not described because I am not sufficiently
familiar with them at this time.  The reader should refer to the appropriate
autodocs.  In some cases, experimentation with the trackdisk.device will
be needed to get all the details.


4.2. ERROR NUMBERS

The following error numbers are listed in the include file
&quot;devices/trackdis.h&quot;.

    #define TDERR_NotSpecified   20 /* general catchall */
    #define TDERR_NoSecHdr       21 /* couldn't even find a sector */
    #define TDERR_BadSecPreamble 22 /* sector looked wrong */
    #define TDERR_BadSecID       23 /* ditto */
    #define TDERR_BadHdrSum      24 /* header had incorrect checksum */
    #define TDERR_BadSecSum      25 /* data had incorrect checksum */
    #define TDERR_TooFewSecs     26 /* couldn't find enough sectors */
    #define TDERR_BadSecHdr      27 /* another &quot;sector looked wrong&quot; */
    #define TDERR_WriteProt      28 /* can't write to a protected disk */
    #define TDERR_DiskChanged    29 /* no disk in the drive */
    #define TDERR_SeekError      30 /* couldn't find track 0 */
    #define TDERR_NoMem          31 /* ran out of memory */
    #define TDERR_BadUnitNum     32 /* asked for a unit &gt; NUMUNITS */
    #define TDERR_BadDriveType   33 /* not a drive that trackdisk groks */
    #define TDERR_DriveInUse     34 /* someone else allocated the drive */
    #define TDERR_PostReset      35 /* user hit reset; awaiting doom */


4.3. SCSIDIRECT PROTOCOL

Most SCSI device drivers support an additional command to issue a generic
SCSI command.  This is described in detail in the include file
&quot;devices/scsidisk.h&quot;.


4.4. A MINIMAL DISK COMMAND SUBSET

It is clear that to implement a full Amiga disk driver supporting removeable
media is a considerable task, and I don't even pretend to know all that is
required.  But if all you want is a simple hard disk driver, a very small
subset of the commands is sufficient.  To begin with, Expunge() can be
stubbed out to always return zero, indicating a delayed expunge which will
never get done.  AbortIO() can be stubbed out to always return a nonzero
result, indicating that it failed.  Unit structures can be done away with;
you can store anything in the &quot;io_Unit&quot; field of the I/O request.  In my
own device driver I just store the SCSI device number and a few flags there.
You can just return I/O error #20 (general catch-all) for anything that
went wrong, except possibly unimplemented commands.  Quick I/O need not
be done; just always clear IOF_QUICK and forget about it.  Send all I/O
requests to a single internal task for processing.  Finally, the
commands can be implemented as follows:

    CMD_READ, CMD_WRITE:        implement fully

    TD_FORMAT:                  same as CMD_WRITE

    TD_GETDRIVETYPE:            return 3.5&quot; drive

    CMD_RESET, CMD_UPDATE,
    CMD_CLEAR, CMD_STOP,
    CMD_START, CMD_FLUSH,
    TD_MOTOR, TD_SEEK,
    TD_REMOVE, TD_CHANGENUM,
    TD_CHANGESTATE,
    TD_PROTSTATUS,
    TD_ADDCHANGEINT,
    TD_REMCHANGEINT:            clear &quot;io_Actual&quot; and return

    Others:                     reject with IOERR_NOCMD

The resulting driver works perfectly with fast and slow file systems,
and all the disk edit/repair utilities I've tried it with.  If you are
bringing up a hard disk from scratch, you can always get a hack driver
to work, then write a &quot;proper&quot; one with the hard disk running.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Motivation =
You want to automatically generate a index configuration file based on instance or XML schema data.

Creation of an index configuration file is difficult for new users.  To help new users get started it is frequently benefitial to generate a sample collection.xconf file for these users based on simple analysis of sample instance data or XML Schemas that are provided by the users.

= Index Types =
There are several types of indexes you may want to create.  Range indexes are very useful when you have identifiers or you want to sort results based on element content.  Fulltext indexes are most frequently used of language text that contains full sentences with punctuation.

== FullText Indexes ==

The following is some example code on how one might do this.

Lucene fulltext indexes are most useful when they index fulltext sentences.  One approach is to scan an instance document for full sentences looking for longer strings with punctuation.  Although a full implementation would involve the inclusion of a &quot;Natural Language Processor&quot; library such as Apache UIMA, we can begin with some very simple rules.

Here are some sample steps in the process for non-mixed-text content.  Mixed text can also be done but the steps are more complex:
# get a list of all elements in a sample index file
# classify the elements according to if they have simple or complex content
# if they have simple content, look for sentences (spaces and puncuation)
# for each element that has fulltext create a lucene index

= Sample Code for Namespace Generation =

This creates an index on &lt;foo&gt; with every namespace that is used in
the collection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Social networks''' are networks in which the vertices are people, and the edges represent some form of social interaction between them, such as friendship.&lt;ref name=Newman&gt;Networks: An Introduction, M. E. J. Newman, Oxford University Press (2010).&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing from graph theory, networks are comprised of vertices (&quot;actors&quot;) and edges (&quot;ties&quot;). 

Actors may be individuals or groups, and different types of actors may be included, forming a &lt;i&gt;bipartite&lt;/i&gt; graph. An example of a bipartite graph would be of individuals and social organizations. In this case, no ties exist between nodes of a common type (in this case, individuals or organizations).

Ties represent relationships. Relationships could be friendships, but they could also be professional or business relationships, communication relationships, economic relationships, and so on. The types of relationships that appear will depend upon what aspects of the network the researcher is trying to capture. Ties may also incorporate magnitude or character, and plotting multiple different ties between actors results in &lt;i&gt;multiplex&lt;/i&gt; relationships. Multiplex relationships may exist between neighbors who go to dinner parties, do lawncare, or babysit for/with one another. These relationships have different characters but exist between the same actors.

==Importance==
The importance of understanding social networks is highlighted in a story of community survival. As related by Gans,&lt;ref name=Gans&gt;Gans, Herbert, J., The Urban Villagers: Group and Class in the Life of Italian-Americans, Free Press, 1962. ISBN 0029112400.&lt;/ref&gt; the primarily Jewish and Italian immigrant community of Boston's West End neighborhood was incapable of even forming an organization to oppose the urban renewal project that ended up razing large parts of their hometown and drastically altering their way of life. While social cohesion was observed to be very strong between persons, this microscopic characteristic disguised the society's larger symptoms of fragmentation into cliques. The absence of even weak ties between these tightly grouped cliques prevented communication of ideas and the call to action between these groups.

The opportunity for profit is also a great driver to understand social networks. The internet-based social network site [http://www.facebook.com Facebook.com] was valued by Goldman Sachs at $50 billion dollars in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/01/02/goldman-invests-in-facebook-at-50-billion-valuation/&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies and organizations are trying to leverage social media to help with marketing and demand forecasting, taking advantage of the large and growing amount of data about social interactions that are available on Facebook and from similar sources.

At the same time, due to developments in network science and computing power, standards are being accepted in the sociology community regarding measures and methods for analysis and comparison of social networks. While academic interest has surrounded the topic for some time, social network problems were often too complex and too large for researchers to handle. The increased demand for understanding, along with the promulgation of tools to investigate social networks, have driven rapid growth in subfields seeking to understand network dynamics, power, prestige, and diffusion across networks, such as would be caused by introduction of new products, new ideas, and valuable information like evacuation procedures.

==History in Sociology&lt;ref name=Degenne&gt;Introducing Social Networks. A. Degenne and M. Forse. Sage Publications: London. 1999&lt;/ref&gt;==
Conventional sociology drew individuals out of their social structures in order to study relationships between identifiable variables, thereby defining any &quot;structure&quot; by individual attributes. When looking for reasons to explain behaviors, “norms” were suggested, which were drawn from these categories, or from conventional wisdom or attitudes. However, this analysis at its heart amounts to either attempting to confirm prior expectations, or else correlating categories in a way which doesn’t necessarily correspond to the underlying causes being researched - by analyzing the relationships of variables within pools of individuals with no regard to the individuals' networks or network positions, valuable information that could distinguish individuals from one another and highlight present discrepancies is effectively thrown out.

Considering social networks requires relational and structural analysis between actors, which requires that ties and relationships are incorporated into the analysis. When individuals or groups with sets of categories are considered as structurally related, the norms and causes from these structures make sense. Network analysis studies individuals &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; their links as a means towards an overarching structural analysis, in which the structure is not simply the sum of its actors but requires understanding of the network as a whole. Likewise, it is noteworthy that structures influence but cannot control individual actions. One can now examine the density of a network or an actor’s position to assist an investigation in ways that simple categories cannot. Individuals (actors) cannot be considered the basic unit of social networks, because  an individual is - at least to some extent - a product of the social structure in which she finds herself, which extends far beyond the reach of her individual person.

==Data Collection==
===Interviews and Surveys===
Interviews and surveys are common means of data collection for studies in the social sciences. Interviews and surveys can be used to build multiplex, well-defined networks, since they are able to utilize a consistent, transparent measure for evaluating ties and actors. They are insightful to the extent the questions asked mirror reality, and may provide insight into actor bias. On the downside, these methods often tend to be relatively laborious and inaccurate, capable of capturing and modeling only small networks. However, if well-constructed, surveys can avoid or mitigate many shortcomings.

'''Name generators''' ask respondents to offer names to fill certain descriptions: “__ is my best friend.” A common method of generating data, name generators are, by nature, directional and so produce digraphs; they also tend to be very limited in their ability to finding weak ties, due both to survey construction (which tends to focus on an actor's strongest and richest ties) and to respondent memory and bias. Along similar lines, name generators tend to artificially bound an actor's (out-)degree by only asking for so many names rather than allowing for an exhaustive list to be compiled.

Using '''names from directories''' means grabbing a random sample of last names from a directory, e.g. phone book, and asking respondents to list people they know with that name – useful for “how many people do you know” studies. It must be cautioned, however, that biases in regional names or populations be addressed when attempting to use this method and extrapolate its results, especially for one of these studies.

'''Snowball sampling''' asks respondents to pass surveys or some other indicator on to their contacts, who pass it on to their contacts, and so forth. This method can be very enlightening in studies of network dynamics and allow access to populations the researcher otherwise might have otherwise been excluded from. On the other hand, response rates tend to be low, and initial surveys must be distributed carefully if getting many surveys caught in small, tight populations is to be avoided.

===Direct Observation===
Observation requires watching and recording actors objectively, and clearly defining actors and ties. In some social networks, for example, those of animals, this method is the only one available to researchers.&lt;ref name=Degenne /&gt; Direct observation has the advantage of avoiding inaccuracies due to memory lapse or bias, as well as the inclusion of every observable actor rather than only those who opt to respond to a questionnaire. This method usually allows for collection of reliable, accurate data in a short period of time, although ties that are observed may not be as clearly defined as is possible with a survey, and nuances or multiplexity present in those ties that are discerned may be missed by a distant third party.

'''Diaries''' may be kept by a researcher or research subject, with the basic purpose of recording names of people and interactions. These may also serve as name generators for other studies. However, diaries are arduous for research subjects to keep, and fatigue and complacency may bias results.

===Archival and Third-Party Records===
Archival records include historical records, but may also include electronic chains: e-mail records, internet links, public-key signing network. Like direct observation, collection of archival data limits exposure to inaccuracies due to memory lapse, bias, and low response rates. A large amount of data may also be accessed and organized in a very short time. However, similar issues arise in that ties may not offer clear indications of strength or multiplexity; this can be an especially difficult problem with archival records because the researcher is far removed from the actors and ties being examined, and the data used is usually final, with limited opportunity to add to it or fill in gaps.

Regardless of the method used, the resultant network must be framed and qualified in such a way that data collection methods (and the implications thereof) be made clear.

==Social Network Analysis==
Since types and meanings of social networks are varied, so are the methods use to analyze and compare them. Some measures may transfer well between analyses, while others are better-suited (or exclusively meant) for specific types of networks. The list of methods utilized should be tailored to suit the researcher's analytical goal. Following is a survey of basic methods and concepts that form a basis for social network analysis.

===Network Size===
Every network requires a boundary, which must be arbitrary to some point. “Total network” studies are impractical, although methods exist to estimate the connectedness of very large networks. Sola Pool&lt;ref name=Degenne /&gt; used names drawn from phone books as well as diary methods to estimate the number of people he and other subjects knew by face and name. Stanley Milgram's famous 1967 &quot;six Degrees&quot; experiment used snowball methods to transfer journals from residents in Nebraska and Boston to a Boston stockbroker, with each successful journal traveling across a mean 5.2 ties to its target.&lt;ref&gt;Stanley Milgram, &quot;The Small World Problem&quot;, Psychology Today, 1967, Vol. 2, 60-67.&lt;/ref&gt; 

For studies that require a pre-defined boundary, within which all actors and ties should be examined, geography often provides a suitable guide for partitioning populations. This is not only convenient for researchers, but a 1986 study by the French government concluded that '[Social] circles coalesce in certain places.'&lt;ref&gt;OCS (1986) L'Esprit des lieux. Paris: CNRS.&lt;/ref&gt; While actors within these circles surely participate in ties outside of them and outside of the geographical area of interest, a geographical boundary that is well-drawn, perhaps with the aid of a person who knows the area and its inhabitants, can provide a useful and distinct boundary for the social network to be constructed.

===Ego Networks===
[[File:Ego_network.png‎|thumb|right|An ego network. The red actor is the ''ego'', while blue actors are ''alters''. The most significant ties are those between alters.]]
A common form networks may take is that of the ''ego network,'' which comprises a central actor (the ''ego'') and her contacts (''alters''). While the ties between the ego and alters may be enlightening for some purposes, often more important are the ties between alters. In fact, ego networks are often considered without the ego or his links to the alters, as these tend to be consistent and, as such, unnecessary. (In the case that they are not, of course, including the ego as an actor may still be prudent.)

But how far out from the ego should we look to capture the network that affects him? Mark Granovetter suggests that two degrees, or &quot;friends of friends&quot;, should be sufficient for most purposes.&lt;ref name=Gran&gt;The Strength of Weak Ties. Mark S. Granovetter. American Journal of Sociology, Volume 78, Issue 6 (May, 1973), 1360-1380.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the extent of the network, ego networks are useful for examining local network properties and their possible influence on an actor.

===The Strength of Weak Ties (1973)&lt;ref name=Gran /&gt;===
[[File:Forbidden_triad.png‎|thumb|left|At left, an allowable triad: transitivity is too weak and the lack of ties is allowed. At middle, an allowable triad: transitivity dictates that a weak tie arises between two alters strongly linked to ego. At right, the forbidden triad: transitivity demands that a tie exist in the designated gap.]]
[[File:Weak_tie_bridge.png‎|thumb|left|Only a weak tie may form a bridge. Note that the strong tie between green and red causes a number of forbidden triads to arise; if it is reduced to a weak tie, it legally acts as a bridge. While a longer connecting route between the groups exists below, transmission through this path length is infeasible.]]

&quot;The strength of weak ties&quot; is Mark Granovetter's groundbreaking work that shed light on the impact of tie strength on network analysis, with strong implications for network dynamics and community cohesion. Granovetter uses concepts of the strength of ties (a tie that is present is considered either strong or weak, depending on some measure of social proximity of the actors it links) and transitivity of ties to propose a &quot;forbidden triad.&quot; The potential tie between two alters to an ego depends upon the strength of each alter's tie to the ego: if one or both are tied only weakly, there is no need for the alters to be tied; if, however, both have strong ties to the ego, there is a great likelihood that they will have met and will have enough in common to have established (at least) a weak tie. The forbidden triad, then, is that which violates this transitivity.

The immediate implication of this premise is that only weak ties may be “bridges,” or unique connections between two groups of actors. Of course, following Milgram's premise of &quot;Six Degrees&quot; (above), no groups will ever be perfectly isolated, but their proximity in the absence of such a direct tie can be so low as to consider the long path that connects them to be negligible. In short, a tie is valuable because of its uniqueness, and transitivity of ties causes strong ties to become less unique: this ability to be very unique is the strength of weak ties.

Drawing from notions of network resilience and reliability, the unique positions that weak ties may occupy indicate their relevance in increasing a network's connectedness and centralization. In ego networks, the absence of weak ties (which may also be caused by a preponderance of strong ties) leads to actor encapsulation. Drawing this phenomenon out to larger networks, an examination of microstructure shows that strong cohesion prevails, but the absence of weak ties to connect these tight clusters of actors results in a very weakly connected set of groups making up the community, which hinders communication and a sense of identity across the network. Taking Boston's West End (above) as a prototype, communities exhibiting this sort of structure are at risk when facing a common threat that requires a unified effort on their part.

Besides community survival, weak ties play a role in assisting in the job hunt. While it may be readily hypothesized that strong ties may be more useful for an ego in making contacts since those alters connected by strong ties will have greater motivation to assist ego, and empirical evidence bears out the idea that network structure appears to have primacy over motivation in gathering references while job hunting.

In terms of idea innovation and adoption, encapsulation again opposes diffusion. Studies of drug prescriptions have shown that “first adopters” to prescribe new drugs are marginal in networks of doctors, while “early adopters” are more centrally located and tied to the first adopters. (That is, they happened on this new idea and spread it well to their contemporaries through their position of prestige and strong ties.) Granovetter suggested diffusing new information starting with people with many weak ties. These will be marginal in a large number of networks, allowing access to more potential “early adopters.”

===Density and Multiplexity===
[[File:Sample_network.png‎|thumb|right|Taking straight lines to count for two exchanges and dotted lines to count for one exchange, the density of this network is 0.444 and the multiplexity is 1.75. In terms of cohesion, the whole network is a 3-clique, while the lower (black) portion is a 2-clique that is a 2-plex.]]

Density and multiplexity are measures of network “tightness.”

'''Density''' is a network characteristic, and is the ratio of existing links to possible links.

:&lt;math&gt;Density = \frac{2t}{n\left(n-1\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; = the total number of existing ties, and
:&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = the total number of nodes.

'''Multiplexity''' is a measure used to describe relationships between actors that may include different types or strengths of ties. Multiplex relationships may exist, for example, between neighbors, who go to dinner parties, do lawncare, or babysit for/with one another. These relationships have different characters but exist between the same actors. Numerically, multiplexity may be considered to be the ratio of total exchanges to total ties. If it is boiled down to a number, the magnitude of this number characterizes an &quot;average tie strength.&quot;

:&lt;math&gt;Multiplexity = \frac{e}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt; is as above, and

:&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; = the total number of exchanges in all ties.

===Cohesion and Equivalence===
Cohesion and equivalence are properties that relate actors and groups of actors to one another.

'''Cohesion''' is concerned with ''cliques,'' or strongly connected groups of actors, and the overlap between these. ''Affiliation networks,'' which are bipartite networks that include some actors that are, for example, individuals and some that are organizations or other meeting groups, are especially able to depict network cohesion. Relevant terms used in examining cohesion are:

:''n-clique'' – clique with paths of length ≤ n between any two nodes.
:''k-plex'' – a set of nodes such that each is adjacent to all but k others.

These definitions are applied maximally – that is, n-cliques and k-plexes include as many actors as possible.

[[File:Equivalence.png‎|thumb|left|Left: regular equivalence. Right: structural equivalence.]]
'''Equivalence''' deals with common types of relations and roles between classes of actors, even in the (possible) absence of direct ties. One example of equivalence is the relationship of doctor to patient. Not all doctors know all patients; neither all doctors know each other nor all patients know each other. Yet the relations of a given doctor to a given patient bear resemblance.

''Regular equivalence'' requires that every actor must have at least one tie befitting her class, and relate consistently to actors in other classes.

''Structural equivalence'' requires that every actor in a class relates to ''every'' other in a certain class in a certain manner.

At first, this latter definition might appear hard to achieve, but structural equivalence may be possible in a case such as that all members of an army at war must treat members of the opposing army as enemies.&lt;ref name=Degenne /&gt; 

Equivalence can be sticky (which is why it may also be nice.) Take an example from teaching: a graduate student might be a teaching assistant, teaching courses but also take classes. Since the student is sometimes learning and sometimes teaching, he is equivalent to neither. Moreover, a hierarchy trying to take into account graduate students cannot use measures of equivalence defined in this way. In practice, statistical approaches to equivalence, along with analysis of clusters, is usually suitable.

===Centrality, Power and Prestige===
An actor's centrality, power, and prestige are measures that are largely influenced by her network position and relationships.&lt;ref name=Degenne /&gt; While the former is a well- (albeit variously-) defined term in network science, concepts of power and prestige are particular to social networks, and are subject to nonlinear and confounding influences from surrounding actors. 

'''Centrality''' concerns an actor's position in a network with respect to all other actors' positions. Based on the network and purpose of research, different measures of centrality may used. ''Degree centrality'' counts the number of ties (in, out, or both) that an actor has, and is therefore a straightforward but local measure. ''Closeness centrality'' gives a measure of “inverse remoteness” to other nodes by taking into account the shortest distance between an actor and every other actor in the network in its computation. ''Betweenness centrality'' is similar to closeness centrality, but demands that the point be an intermediary on many geodesics that connect &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; actors to one another, thereby capturing the importance of an actor's position to the relationships that take place over the whole network. ''Flow betweenness'' requires that ties be weighted by the flow of some good or information along them, and simply adds up flows over the same geodesics as the computation for betweenness centrality.

'''Centralization''' is a measure of a network that combines the centrality of all its actors. It may be normalized and used for comparison of networks.

'''Power''' and '''prestige''' are based on the idea of centrality in a social network, but centrality is often not an adequate measure to model these real-world concepts. Organizational social scientists say “there is no power, only powerful ties.”&lt;ref name=Degenne /&gt; It is also acknowledged that different types of power exist, though there is general consent that these are inversely related to an actor's vulnerability and dependence. Power or prestige may also be dwarfed (or amplified) due to proximity to another actor with higher power or prestige. In short, these factors must include power or prestige of nearby actors. The following measures also utilize directional tie values.

One formulation that takes this into account is Bonacich’s measure of centrality:&lt;ref&gt;Bonacich, P. (1987) 'Power and centrality: a family of measures', American Journal of Sociology, 92 (5): 1170-82.&lt;/ref&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;C_i = \sum_j \left(\alpha + \beta C_j\right)r_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; = normalizing parameter
:&lt;math&gt;C_j&lt;/math&gt; = centrality of actor j
:&lt;math&gt;r_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; = value of i-j relation
:&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; = modeling parameter

The modeling parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is chosen with regard to the situation at hand. &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; = 0 means that centrality increases with number and magntiude of direct relations. &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; &gt; 0 takes alter centrality into account in a positive manner, such that being near powerful or prestigious actors increases one's own power or prestige. &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; &lt; 0 takes alter centrality into account in a negative manner - forcing actors to &quot;share the limelight.&quot;

Another valuable measure is that of ''extended relations'', which weights relations and results in a normalized average marginal strength of received ties. This measure sums an actor's relationship as a proportion of its importance to the alter, and is therefore a good measure of prestige:


:&lt;math&gt;{ER}_i = \sum_j \frac{\left(z_{ij}/{max}\left(z_{jk}\right)\right)}{\left(N-1\right)}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;{ER}_i&lt;/math&gt; = extended relation value of actor &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;, a number between 0 and 1
:&lt;math&gt;z_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; = strength of i-j tie
:&lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; = total number of actors in network

''Power'' is also considered as a quantity, its calculation taking into account exclusivity and power of ties, whereby power is shared positively between actors:


:&lt;math&gt;p_i = \sum_j \left(z_{ji}/\sum_k z_{jk}\right)p_j&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt; = power of actor &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;z_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; = strength of i-j tie

As with extended relations, this last measure sums a similar measure of an ego's importance to each alter times each alter's power. This requires &lt;math&gt;p_j&lt;/math&gt; to compute &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt;, and also vice-versa, so an iterative algorithm must be used.

===Structural Balance===
[[File:Structural_balance.png‎|thumb|right|Consider blue ties to be positive and red ties to be negative. (a) A balanced, harmonious triad. (b) A balanced, &quot;enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot; triad. (c) An unbalanced &quot;love triangle.&quot; (d) An unbalanced three-way struggle.]]
The case of triads is considered, where ties may be either positive or negative. Four triads are possible, and these may be considered either balanced or unbalanced.&lt;ref&gt;Harary, F. (1959) 'On the measurement of structural balance', Behavioural Science, 4: 316-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Balanced graphs are either entirely harmonious or exhibit an &quot;enemy of my enemy is my friend&quot; characteristic. Unbalanced graphs ''tend'' toward balance, but do subsist - consider &quot;love triangles&quot; with enmity on only one side, or three-way races in which each actor competes against each other. Naturally, these triads are just building blocks for what readily become very complex structures.

==Future Opportunities==
The explosion of interest and capability in the study of social networks has allowed a number of fields to be highlighted for future study. Longitudinal studies are possible and feasible with social network sites, e.g. Facebook, and one is being undertaken by the [http://christakis.med.harvard.edu/pages/research/r-images.html Christakis group] at Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;K. Lewis, J. Kaufman, M. Gonzalez, A. Wimmer, and N.A. Christakis, &quot;Tastes, Ties, and Time: A New (Cultural, Multiplex, and Longitudinal) Social Network Dataset Using Facebook.com,&quot; Social Networks  30(4): 330-342 (October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; The study of power in formal and informal organizations can help optimize hierarchical organizations (such as governments and militaries) into more effective structures. Studies of network dynamics, including innovation adoption, will continue to be useful in marketing as well as politics, and studies of concepts of network equilibria and the &quot;social contract&quot; may impact political science and civics. And of course, sociology will always continue its study of norms, social order, and social action, and the powerful lens of network science will aid the field in its research.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Starting out with complex code examples? ==
Is this book designed to ''teach'' python? Because if so, the concepts in there should probably be explained before they are used, i.e. the code examples should not come before an example/explanation of raw_input(), if-elif-else, and all that stuff. Just my thoughts.

*'''Princess Margaret; 2000''' (1958-1990) PMID 10661345 -- &quot;An analysis of 78 breast sarcoma patients without distant metastases at presentation.&quot; (McGowan TS, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2000 Jan 15;46(2):383-90.)
**Retrospective. 78 pts. Included malignant phyllodes tumor (32 pts). Histologic types include stromal sarcoma, angiosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, carcinosarcoma, liposarcoma, and other. Tumors were high grade (III-IV) in 55%, low grade (I-II) in 23%; unspecified in the rest (23%).
**Relapse-free rate: 5 yr 47%, 10 yr 42%. CSS 5 yr 57% and 10 yr 48%. Local relapse free survival 75% at 10 yrs. CSS 85% for low grade and 55% for high grade.
**No statistical difference in outcomes for conservative surgery vs mastectomy. LRFR 33% for positive margin vs 80% for negative margin.
**Conclusion: recommend complete excision followed by 50 Gy to the whole breast and 60 Gy to the tumor bed. Do not recommend axillary lymph node dissection except for pts with carcinosarcoma.

*'''MDACC; 1999''' (1947-1990) PMID 10577703 -- &quot;Role of radiotherapy in sarcoma of the breast--a retrospective review of the M.D. Anderson experience.&quot; (Barrow BJ, Radiother Oncol. 1999 Aug;52(2):173-8.)
**Retrospective. 59 pts. Included pts with malignant sarcomas only. Excluded phyllodes tumor, carcinosarcoma, and fibromatosis. Pathology was largely malignant fibrous histiocytoma, fibrosarcoma, stromal sarcoma, and angiosarcoma. Other histologies in 17% of cases. Tumors were high grade in 42%, intermediate grade in 26%; unspecified in the rest (32%).
**Treatment was mastectomy in 38 (64%), segmental resection in 16 (27%), or excisional biopsy (8%).
**Tumor size and surgical margins were predictive of LF. Following mastectomy alone, LF in 34% vs 13% with mastectomy + RT. For segmental resection alone, LF in 25% (0% with RT). LF in 60% of pts with positive margins who did not receive RT. 75% of LF were in pts treated with surgery alone.
**Conclusion: radiotherapy is probably indicated in cases with large tumor size or positive surgical margins, although no statistical benefit of RT was demonstrated.

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;1. undifferentiated gonad&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The &lt;span class=&quot;zfimgref&quot;&gt;undifferentiated gonad [&lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; is an elongated structure which diametrically only spans a few cells; the organ is composed of mainly undifferentiated gonocytes. In this image, it is bounded by &lt;span class=&quot;zfimgref&quot;&gt;liver [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; and its associated &lt;span class=&quot;zfimgref&quot;&gt;peritoneal tissue  [&lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; on the medial side, and lateral by &lt;span class=&quot;zfimgref&quot;&gt;mesenchyme  [&lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;. Adjacent to the liver, part of the &lt;span class=&quot;zfimgref&quot;&gt;swim bladder  [&lt;b&gt;bs&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;] is visible.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;2. early development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

An early feature of male differentiation of the gonad is ingrowth of stroma [&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;]. Other features, which are not present on this image are appearance of a clustered organisation (spermatocysts) and lumen formation.
This gonad mainly contains undifferentiated gonocytes [&lt;b&gt;g&lt;/b&gt;], but early stages of differentiation [&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;] are also present.

A small part of the liver [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;] is visible.

&lt;td  valign=center &gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;3. early development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This gonad mainly contains early stages of differentiation [&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;], which are characterized by the increased nuclear basophilic staining and decreased size, compared to undifferentiated gonocytes [&lt;b&gt;g&lt;/b&gt;]. 
The hole in this image probably indicates early lumen [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;] formation; early ingrowth of stroma  [&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;] is also visible. 

Adjacent structures in this image are:
liver [&lt;b&gt;Li&lt;/b&gt;] on the medial side
mesenchyme [&lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt;] on the lateral side

&lt;td  valign=center &gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;4. early development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Early features of male differentiation of the gonad are the appearance of a clustered organisation (spermatocysts) and ingrowth of stroma [&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;]. 

This gonad contains early stages of differentiation [&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;], as well as undifferentiated gonocytes [&lt;b&gt;g&lt;/b&gt;]. A vessel [&lt;b&gt;arrows&lt;/b&gt;] can be observed, and adjacent structures in this image are: liver [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;], pancreas [&lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt;], and peritoneal cells [&lt;b&gt;arrowhead&lt;/b&gt;]

&lt;td  valign=center  &gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;5. early development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

This gonad shows the combined presence of clustered organisation (spermatocysts [&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;]) and lumen formation [&lt;b&gt;arrows&lt;/b&gt;], as indications of early male differentiation.

Early stages of differentiation are predominant [&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;], but undifferentiated gonocytes [&lt;b&gt;g&lt;/b&gt;] are also abundant.

Adjacent structures in this image are:
liver [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;]

&lt;td  valign=center  &gt;
&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;6. intermediate development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This gonad shows the combined presence of clustered organisation (spermatocysts [&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;]) and lumen formation [&lt;b&gt;arrows&lt;/b&gt;] as indications of early male differentiation. A prominent blood vessel [&lt;b&gt;v&lt;/b&gt;] filled with erythrocytes [&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;] is present in the stroma.

The spematogenic epithelium contains mainly early and intermediate stages of differentiation [&lt;b&gt;d&lt;/b&gt;], up to early spermatids [&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;]; clusters of undifferentiated gonocytes [&lt;b&gt;g&lt;/b&gt;] are also present.

Adjacent structures in this image are:
liver [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;]
abdominal wall [&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;]

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;7. advanced development&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

This gonad can be identified as a testis by the presence of well-developed lumina, which are filled with sperm [&lt;b&gt;L&lt;/b&gt;], and by the clustered organisation (spermatocysts [&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;]). Clusters of spermatogonia [&lt;b&gt;g&lt;/b&gt;] are also present.

Adjacent structures in this image are:
clustered peritoneal cells [&lt;b&gt;arrows&lt;/b&gt;]

===== ♦ testis-ova =====
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Early oocytes [&lt;b&gt;e&lt;/b&gt;] are observed in the developing testis at varying incidences (1:350 in the RIVM zebrafish stock, 1:10 in the stock of the Veterinary Faculty of the Utrecht University). Thise image shows the phenomenon at a relatively more advanced developmental stages, which includes mature sperm [&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;]. There is an obvious clustered organisation (spermatocysts), combined with clusters of spermatogonia [&lt;b&gt;g&lt;/b&gt;]. Incidently, Sertoli cells [&lt;b&gt;arrowheads&lt;/b&gt;] can be discerned.

The presence of primitive oocytes in the developing testis has been interpreted as a feature of undifferentiated gonochorism or protogyny: the undifferentiated gonad develops into an ovary-like gonad in all individuals and then in about one-half of the population transforms into a testis (&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Takahashi-H. Juvenile hermaphroditism in the zebrafish, Brachydanio rerio. Bull.Fac.Fish.Hokkaido Univ.28:57-65;1977&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt;). Takahashi describes &quot;intersexuality&quot; similar to the images presented here with a maximal incidence of 1:4. These varying incidences indicate that the balance of sex-determining factors is delicate and environmental or genetical variations between stocks may produce a slightly different differentiation process; furthermore. Our observations do not suppport the undifferentiated gonochoristic or protogyny paradigm in zebrafish.

===== ♦ variability between species =====
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;difference of testis development between fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas and zebrafish&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The differentiating testis of zebrafish (upper image) is characterized by clustering of spermatogenic cells [&lt;b&gt;s&lt;/b&gt;] and progression of these clustered cells to meiosis. In the developing testis of fathead minnow, on the contrary, there are only occassional indications of progression to meiosis. This testis is predominated by dividing spermatogonia [&lt;b&gt;g&lt;/b&gt;], which are organised as early tubules [&lt;b&gt;outlined&lt;/b&gt;]; such a tubular organization appears only at a later stage of development of the zebrafish testis. Preliminary lumen [&lt;b&gt;asterisks&lt;/b&gt;] are visible in both species.

The image is predominated by spermatogonia, which are grouped in small clusters. These cells have a high mitotic activity, illustrated by dividing cells in metaphase [&lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt;] and anaphase [&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt;], respectively. 
Sertoli cells [&lt;b&gt;arrows&lt;/b&gt;] can also be distinguished by their (mostly) triangular shape and position at the basement membrane.

&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;testis fully attached to the wall of the peritoneal cavity [Fig.A1]&lt;/b&gt;: The differentiated gonad ([&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;], testis in this image) develops from an undifferentiated gonadal anlage, located retroperitoneally in the caudal peritoneal cavity [&lt;b&gt;cpc&lt;/b&gt;]. It is closely associated with the peritoneum [&lt;b&gt;between arrows&lt;/b&gt;]; ingrowth of stroma into the gonad originates from the peritoneum. At this stage, the testis is in close association with the wall of the peritoneal cavity, and bounded by retroperitoneal mesenchymal tissue [&lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt;] (mainly adipose cells). &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;central detachment [Fig.A2]&lt;/b&gt;: Central detachment of the gonad [&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;] of the peritoneal wall leads to the development of a retrogonadal cavity [&lt;b&gt;rc&lt;/b&gt;]. At this stage, the gonad (testis in this image) remains attached [&lt;b&gt;arrowheads&lt;/b&gt;] to the peritoneal wall on both sides, and these attachments are continuous with the peritoneum [&lt;b&gt;between arrows&lt;/b&gt;]. The gonad now bulges more prominent into the peritoneal cavity [&lt;b&gt;cpc&lt;/b&gt;]; it is no longer closely associated with the retroperitoneal mesenchyme [&lt;b&gt;m&lt;/b&gt;].&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;unilateral attachment [Fig.A3]&lt;/b&gt;: After further detachment, the testis [&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;] appears as a protruding mass in the peritoneal cavity [&lt;b&gt;cpc&lt;/b&gt;]. A single pole of the organ remains attached to the peritoneal wall [&lt;b&gt;arrowheads&lt;/b&gt;]. This attachment area, which is continuous with the peritoneum [&lt;b&gt;arrows&lt;/b&gt;] eventually develops to a testicular stalk, conducting the efferent sperm duct.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;b&gt;persisting bilateral attachement in the ovary [Fig.A4]&lt;/b&gt;: In ovary development, the retrogonadal cavity [&lt;b&gt;rc&lt;/b&gt;] persists and even expands; eventually it becomes the oviduct. The ovary [&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;] thus remains attached bilaterally to the peritoneal wall. The peritoneum [&lt;b&gt;arrows&lt;/b&gt;] constitues the boundary between this future oviduct and the peritoneal cavity [&lt;b&gt;cpc&lt;/b&gt;]. &lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;persisting bilateral attachement in the testis [Fig.A5]&lt;/b&gt;: As shown in this image, the retrogonadal cavity [&lt;b&gt;rc&lt;/b&gt;] may also persist in testis development. The testis [&lt;b&gt;G&lt;/b&gt;] thus remains attached bilaterally to the peritoneal wall [&lt;b&gt;arrowheads&lt;/b&gt;]. It should be noted, however, that this bilateral attachment may indicate feminization, since this animal was staticly exposed to 1 nM 17ß-estradiol (lifetime). The peritoneum [&lt;b&gt;arrows&lt;/b&gt;] constitues the boundary between this cavity and the peritoneal cavity [&lt;b&gt;cpc&lt;/b&gt;].

&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Non-current assets are assets held for longer term, usually because they are one of the classes property, plant or equipment. They are usually initially bought as investments and either are essential for operations of a business or increase the profitability of the business. 

One framework to look at non-current assets is in terms of life cycle stages :  acquiring , holding, disposal. 

===== Fair value =====
The value that can be achieved in an arm's length transaction, after sales costs , or cost of disposal.

===== Carrying value =====
The value as recorded as the  asset's debit amount, less the accumulated depreciation.

===== recoverable value =====
Usually the same as the fair value but can be value in use, if it is higher.

===== value in use =====
This may involve a lot of forecasting . For the intended time the asset is held, an estimate is made of the future cash flow
generated in, and the future cash flow costs out, extrapolated back according to low-risk interest rates to present value 
(the future cash flows would have estimates of inflation and budgeted price increase though). This quantification of future economic benefit is added to the net cash flow from budgeted disposal.

===== Value relationships =====
* The target value is the lower of x and y where y is the higher of a and b, where x = current carrying value , y = recoverable value, a = fair value less disposal costs, and b  = value in use less disposal costs.
* The aim is not to overstate the value, without secondarily understating it.

==== Acquiring, holding , disposal ====
These are the stages that costs may need to be recalculated.
===== Acquiring =====
* a non-current asset is valued as the fair value of the assets &lt;u&gt;given up&lt;/u&gt; in exchange for acquiring the non-current asset. 

Issues dealing with acquisitions are:
* when to capitalize or expend, if acquiring an asset that requires repairs, modifications to bring it up as fit for use to generate future economic benefit. Some &quot;enhancements&quot; may be better written down as expenses if they can't be justified as major repairs or modifications , that for instance, undergo depreciation later.
* fair value proportioning of'' non - whole'' business multiple package acquisitions. This means if one historical cost is applied to acquire a group of assets, each asset needs to be assessed for fair value, and the total of fair values found to be the denominator for each fair value to act as numerator to find the proportionate initial booked cost of each asset. This is because of the value if asset given up rule, meaning the total of book values must equal the value of asset given up ( cash even), in the non-business combination case.
* goodwill (intangible asset) or bargain (gain income) can be recorded for'' whole businesses'' acquired at cost different to fair value, as the '''business combination''' of your entity and the acquired entity means the acquired entity's assets are booked at fair value under the subsidiary entity.
* current assets acquired under the above two cases are recorded at fair value  (and aren't included in apportioning in non business combination case), unless  it is a debtor account ( accounts receivable), then the difference between book value and fair value can recorded as a credit to bad debt allocation if fair value is lower.

Other points to consider:
* liabilities can be acquired, like accounts payable, and a are similarly credits to the entities accounts payable liability , like acquired bad debt allocations.
* shares are liquid assets which have a fair value when disposed of, and can be exchanged at fair value for acquisition of non-current assets.

===== goodwill =====
Goodwill applies to &lt;u&gt;business combinations&lt;/u&gt;, where the asset being bought is a whole business and not the assets of a business.

Goodwill is recorded separately as a form of intangible asset on acquisition , and impairment expenses can be recorded against it ( see impairment of non-current assets ). Goodwill cannot be onsold, but another entity can purchase the subsidiary business with a new agreed amount of goodwill.

Sometimes, the acquirer or buyer pays less than the fair value of the assets making up the acquired business, so the opposite of goodwill is a '''bargain''', which is classed as an ''other income''  or '''gain''' (not arising from normal operations, and hence not ''profit'' ), and equals the total fair value of the acquired business's assets , less the bargain amount paid to acquire it, as agreed to by the acquiree ( the former owner ).

===== held assets - depreciation =====
There are several methods of depreciation available. The most easily understandable are straight line depreciation , and unit of use depreciation. They all share in common a target residual value in order to give depreciable amount, and the concept of useful life. Useful life can be thought of simply as time e.g. years, but in units of use depreciation, it can be number of units produced, number of operating hours, tons of raw material processed , etc. 
Another kind of depreciation is diminishing balance, where there is logarithmic rate of depreciation, e.g. a fixed % of the remaining balance of asset value after subtracting accumulated depreciation is determined to be the current period's rate of depreciation. This might be applied to an asset that exhibits greater ability for producing economic benefit when newer and more efficient.

If beginning with the concepts of useful life and residual value, the diminishing balance method can be easily expressed with the years-remaining-over-sum-of-years method, where the ordinal values of each year in the useful life is summed to give the denominator (e.g. 3 years useful life, 1 + 2 + 3 = 6), and the years remaining of life is the numerator, of the rate of depreciation for a given year (e.g. year 1 is 3/6, year 2 is 2/6, year 3 is 1/6). ( The rate of depreciation is applied to the initial cost of the asset, not the cost less accumulated depreciation).

When analysing income statements to determine '''cash''' flow, ''depreciation is a non-cash expense'' and should be added back in as it doesn't contribute to outflow of cash like other expenses do eventually.

===== held assets - impairment testing and revaluation model =====
* If there is an indicator that the book value of an asset is greater than the recoverable value, than assessment of the recoverable value is made, and if the suspicion is correct, then the asset has an impairment loss expense and accumulated impairment loss contra-asset recorded. The accumulated depreciation can be renamed ''accumulated depreciation and impairment loss'' in order to summarise negative changes to asset value.
* assets held at historical acquisition cost are following the cost model until a revaluation is made, and then they are in the revaluation model, and a revaluation surplus equity account is created for the asset (assuming the asset is going to be re-valued higher). The asset is debited for the surplus and the revaluation surplus equity account is credited for the surplus. Any accumulated depreciation should be '''written-back''' to the asset, just as in disposal,  to come to the new re-valued asset value, with zero accumulated depreciation.
For downwards re-valuation, it is similiar to asset impairment, except the expense of the lost amount from re-valuation is not recorded against ''accumulated depreciation and impairment loss'' contra-account, but against the asset, since previous accumulated depreciation and impairment loss will be written back in the process of revaluation. 
* A downgrade from either impairment testing or revaluation should be credited to revaluation surplus until it reaches zero. Then revert to either crediting the asset account  if doing revaluation, or crediting the impairment loss contra account ( sometimes combined with accumulated depreciation contra-account)  if doing impairment assessment. 
* depreciation and impairment losses still apply as usual, in the revaluation model, after revaluation has been made.

===== held assets - minor repairs are expensed, whereas major repairs are capitalised =====
When a major repair is performed , this can be added to the asset , along with accumulated depreciation, in order to come up with
a new asset value. Otherwise minor repairs are expensed against accounts payable or cash, but disposal expense of remaining depreciation value of  old parts for major repairs are expensed against the asset (expensed against means act as credit side of double entry to a debit expense).

===== Disposal =====
A pre-step in disposal is to always check the date of disposal and calculate any unrecorded depreciation upto the date of disposal, and make a debit to depreciation expense against a credit to accumulated depreciation , to update accumulated depreciation, prior to making the recordings for disposal.

The former heuristic   was to  record disposals at book value (carrying amount) as a kind of disposal expense debit, along with a zeroing debit to accumulated depreciation (contra-asset), against a credit for the   acquisition or revalued cost of the asset (the historical cost as recorded not including accumulated depreciation).  A separate transaction was  a credit of the purchase price to  a special income account credit &quot;proceeds from sale&quot; ,  against a debit to cash in bank ,or in the case of exchange, against a debit to the new non-current asset account of the asset being acquired. 

The new net method is to record the difference between the carrying amount and the sale price as a gain or loss, and any loss on scrapping of assets with residual value or loss on scrapping from removal costs as a net loss.  The net gain or loss is then reported in the income statement, which previously could only be shown if a separate entries of disposal expense (residual value and disposal costs)  and proceeds from sale were two items shown in the income statement regarding the assets disposal. This net method of asset disposal disclosure loses the disclosure of the residual value of the asset at disposal in the income statement.
  
* If the proceeds from sale is less than the book value, then the loss will be shown in the income statement when profit = income minus expenses. Gain is similar.

* if the proceeds from sale is less than the fair value, but the fair value is greater than the book value, then the above still applies. But if proceeds from sale &lt; fair value &lt; book value, there may be an argument to do some fancy book work and record the impairment in asset value , e.g. as a  impairment loss expense debit, and a accumulated impairment loss credit ( viewing impairment as a depreciation-like contra-asset account ). Some authorities suggest renaming accumulated depreciation to accumulated depreciation and impairment loss. 
{{BookCat}}
* The other cases are  book value &lt; proceeds from sale &lt; fair value, and book value &lt; fair value &lt; proceeds from sale. In the latter case, no one is worried who has put money in the company because a gain was made, but in the first a loss was made, despite the books showing a gain. Ideally , the book value should be revalued to fair value, the revaluation surplus recorded, and the book value adjusted before the sale. Then the loss would be shown in the income statement.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">''Introductory Chemistry Online'' is an open-source introductory chemistry textbook/workbook that is designed cover a college-level one-semester course. Many contemporary textbooks in chemistry seem have adopted the notion that &quot;more is better&quot;; the books are long, expensive, and the pages are often cluttered with interesting tidbits and restatements of what it is that you have “just learned”. The Chemistry Online text, on the other extreme, is designed to be simple, uncluttered and very much to the point. This text was under development at a main-stream publisher when I realized that it was destined to become &quot;yet another&quot; $200 textbook that would be &quot;revised&quot; every three years. I withdrew from my contract and removed the Publisher's material. A printed, basic black-and-white textbook based on the revised Introductory Chemistry Online text is relatively inexpensive (about $30), compared with traditional textbooks, and is available through the Wikibooks mechanism, or through the Chemistry Online website. Profits from book sales support the external site and help pay contractual licensing fees and royalties. You can also print the book yourself by clicking on 'print version' on the left sidebar, or download the book as PDF and print it there. You can also visit [[Special:Book]], compile all pages within the book and order a copy to be printed from [http://pediapress.com/ PediaPress]. Within the printed text, the photographs, illustrations and problems are either licensed through third-party vendors, prepared by contributing authors, or they are available within the public domain. Because the licensed content cannot be distributed as public domain, Figures, Exercises and End-of-Chapter problems are only available through links provided in the text; but the full content is available. In order to gain maximum advantage from the text, you should use the accompanying website and work through the problems and the tutorials. This will give you an internal check on your developing chemistry problem-solving skills and make the entire subject clearer and less intimidating. On the website, you will also have access to a full set of lecture slides for each chapter. These are based on the slides that are used in classes at the University of Illinois at Chicago; ''if you are an instructor using this text, you may request access to the full set of PowerPoint slides in editable format'' from the author below. The website also has an assortment of archived exams. Instructors using this text are encouraged to “partner” with us and contribute to the collection. Again, these may not exactly reflect what you see on exam day, but they are an excellent reviewing and assessment tool.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;big&gt;'''Chapter 1:  Measurements and Atomic Structure'''&lt;/big&gt;==
Chemistry is the study of matter and the ways in which different forms of matter combine with each other. You study chemistry because it helps you to understand the world around you. Everything you touch or taste or smell is a chemical, and the interactions of these chemicals with each other define our universe. Chemistry forms the fundamental basis for biology and medicine.  From the structure of proteins and nucleic acids, to the design, synthesis and manufacture of drugs, chemistry allows you an insight into how things work.   Chapter One in this text will introduce you to matter, atoms and their structure.  You will learn the basics of scientific measurement and you will gain an appreciation of the scale of chemistry; from the tiniest atom to the incredibly large numbers dealt with in the “mole concept” (Chapter 4).  Chapter One lays the foundation on which we will build our understanding.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;1.1  Why Study Chemistry? ==

Chemistry is the branch of science dealing with the structure, composition, properties, and the reactive characteristics of matter.  Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space.  Thus, chemistry is the study of literally everything around us &amp;ndash; the liquids that we drink, the gasses we breath, the composition of everything from the plastic case on your mp3 player to the earth beneath your feet.  Moreover, chemistry is the study of the transformation of matter.  Crude oil is transformed into more useful petroleum products such as gasoline and kerosene by the process of refining.  Some of these products are further transformed into plastics.  Crude metal ores are transformed into metals, that can then be fashioned into everything from foil to automobiles.  Potential drugs are identified from natural sources, isolated and then prepared in the laboratory.  Their structures are systematically modified to produce the pharmaceuticals that have led to vast advances in modern medicine.  Chemistry is at the center of all of these processes and chemists are the people that study the nature of matter and learn to design, predict and control these chemical transformations.  Within the branches of chemistry you will find several apparent subdivisions. Inorganic chemistry, historically, focused on minerals and metals found in the earth, while organic chemistry dealt with carbon-containing compounds that were first identified in living things.  Biochemistry is an outgrowth of the application of organic chemistry to biology and relates to the chemical basis for living things.  In the later chapters of this text we will explore organic and biochemistry in a bit more detail and you will notice examples of organic compounds scattered throughout the text.  Today, the lines between the various fields have blurred significantly and a contemporary chemist is expected to have a broad background in all of these areas.[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/1.1.html Figure 1.1]

In this chapter we will discuss some of the properties of matter, how chemists measure those properties and we will introduce some of the vocabulary that is used throughout chemistry and the other physical sciences.  

Let’s begin with matter.  Matter is defined as any substance that has mass.  It’s important to distinguish here between weight and mass.  Weight is the result of the pull of gravity on an object.  On the Moon, an object will weigh less than the same object on Earth because the pull of gravity is less on the Moon.  The mass of an object, however, is an inherent property of that object and does not change, regardless of location, gravitational pull, or whatever.  It is a property that is solely dependent on the quantity of matter within the object.

Contemporary theories suggests that matter is composed of atoms. Atoms themselves, are constructed from neutrons, protons and electrons, along with an ever-increasing array of other subatomic particles.  We will focus on the neutron, a particle having no charge, the proton, which carries a positive charge, and the electron, which has a negative charge.  Atoms are incredibly small.  To give you an idea of the size of an atom, a single copper penny contains approximately 28,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms (that’s 28 sextillion)[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/1.2.html Figure 1.2].  Because atoms and subatomic particles are so small, their mass is not readily measured using pounds, ounces, grams or any other scale that we would use on larger objects.  Instead, the mass of atoms and subatomic particles is measured using atomic mass units (abbreviated amu).  The atomic mass unit is based on a scale that relates the mass of different types of atoms to each other (using the most common form of the element carbon as a standard).  The amu scale gives us a convenient means to describe the masses of individual atoms and to do quantitative measurements concerning atoms and their reactions.  Within an atom, the neutron and proton both have a mass of one amu;  the electron has a much smaller mass (about 0.0005 amu).

Atomic theory places the neutron and the proton in the center of the atom in the nucleus.  In an atom, the nucleus is very small, very dense, carries a positive charge (from the protons) and contains virtually all of the mass of the atom.  Electrons are placed in a diffuse cloud surrounding the nucleus.  The electron cloud carries a net negative charge (from the charge on the electrons) and in a neutral atom there are always as many electrons in this cloud as there are protons in the nucleus (the positive charges in the nucleus are balanced by the negative charges of the electrons, making the atom neutral).

An atom is characterized by the number of neutrons, protons and electrons that it possesses.  Today, we recognize at least 116 different types of atoms, each type having a different number of protons in its nucleus.  These different types of atoms are called elements.  The neutral element hydrogen (the lightest element) will always have one proton in its nucleus and one electron in the cloud surrounding the nucleus. The element helium will always have two protons in its nucleus. It is the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom that defines the identity of an element.  Elements can, however, have differing numbers of neutrons in their nucleus.  For example, stable helium nuclei exists that contain one, or two neutrons (but they all have two protons).  These different types of helium atoms have different masses (3 or 4 amu) and they are called isotopes.  For any given isotope, the sum of the numbers of protons and neutrons in the nucleus is called the mass number.  All elements exist as a collection of isotopes, and the mass of an element that we use in chemistry, the atomic mass, is the average of the masses of these isotopes.  For helium, there is approximately one isotope of Helium-3 for every million isotopes of Helium-4, hence the average atomic mass is very close to 4 (4.002602).  

As different elements were discovered and named, abbreviations of their names were developed to allow for a convenient chemical shorthand.  The abbreviation for an element is called its chemical symbol.  A chemical symbol consists of one or two letters, and the relationship between the symbol and the name of the element is generally apparent.  Thus helium has the chemical symbol He, nitrogen is N, and lithium is Li.  Sometimes the symbol is less apparent but is decipherable;  magnesium is Mg, strontium is Sr, and manganese is Mn.  Symbols for elements that have been known since ancient times, however, are often based on Latin or Greek names and appear somewhat obscure from their modern English names.  For example, copper is Cu (from cuprum), silver is Ag (from argentum), gold is Au (from aurum), and iron is (Fe from ferrum).  Throughout your study of chemistry, you will routinely use chemical symbols and it is important that you begin the process of learning the names and chemical symbols for the common elements.  By the time you complete General Chemistry, you will find that you are adept at naming and identifying virtually all of the 116 known elements.  Table 1.1 contains a starter list of common elements that you should begin learning now!

&lt;br&gt;
	The chemical symbol for an element is often combined with information regarding the number of protons and neutrons in a particular isotope of that atom to give the atomic symbol.  To write an atomic symbol, you begin with the chemical symbol, then write the atomic number for the element (the number of protons in the nucleus) as a subscript, preceding the chemical symbol.  Directly above this, as a superscript, now write the mass number for the isotope, that is, the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus.  Thus, for helium, the atomic number is 2 and there are two neutrons in the nucleus for the most common isotope (see [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/1.3.html Figure 1.3]), making the atomic symbol &lt;math&gt;{}_{2}^{4}\text{He}&lt;/math&gt;.  In the definition of the atomic mass unit, the “most common isotope of carbon”, &lt;math&gt;{}_{6}^{12}\text{C}&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as having a mass of exactly 12 amu and the atomic masses of the remaining elements are based on their masses relative to this isotope.  Chlorine (chemical symbol Cl) consists of two major isotopes, one with 18 neutrons (the most common, comprising 75.77% of natural chlorine atoms) and one with 20 neutrons (the remaining 24.23%).  The atomic number of chlorine is 17 (it has 17 protons in its nucleus), therefore the chemical symbols for the two isotopes are &lt;math&gt;{}_{17}^{35}\text{Cl}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;{}_{17}^{37}\text{Cl}&lt;/math&gt;.[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/1.5.html Figure 1.5a]

	When data is available regarding the natural abundance of various isotopes of an element, it is simple to calculate the average atomic mass.  In the example above, &lt;math&gt;{}_{17}^{35}\text{Cl}&lt;/math&gt;  was the most common isotope with an abundance of 75.77% and &lt;math&gt;{}_{17}^{37}\text{Cl}&lt;/math&gt;  had an abundance of the remaining 24.23%.  To calculate the average mass, first convert the percentages into fractions; that is, simply divide them by 100.  Now, chlorine-35 represents a fraction of natural chlorine of 0.7577 and has a mass of 35 (the mass number).  Multiplying these, we get (0.7577 × 35) = 26.51.  To this, we need to add the fraction representing chlorine-37, or (0.2423 × 37) = 8.965;  adding, (26.51 + 8.965) = 35.48, which is the weighted average atomic mass for chlorine.  Whenever we do mass calculations involving elements or compounds (combinations of elements), we always need to use average atomic masses.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;1.2	Organization of the Elements:  The Periodic Table==
The number of protons in the nucleus of an element is called the atomic number of that element.  Chemists typically place elements in order of increasing atomic numbers in a special arrangement that is called the periodic table ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/1.4.html Figure 1.4]).  
 
	As you can see from Figure 1.4, the periodic table is not simply a grid of elements arranged numerically.  In the periodic table, the elements are arranged in horizontal rows called periods (numbered in blue) and vertically into columns called groups. These groups are numbered by two, somewhat conflicting, schemes.  In the simplest presentation, favored by the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry ('''IUPAC'''), the groups are simply numbered 1-18.  The convention in much of the world, however, is to number the first two groups 1A and 2A, the last six groups 3A-8A; the middle ten groups are then numbered 1B-8B (but not in that order!). While the IUPAC numbering appears much simpler, in this text we will use the current USA nomenclature (1A-8A).  The reason for this choice will become more apparent in Chapter 3 when we discuss “valence” and electron configuration in more detail.  The actual layout of the periodic table is based on the grouping of the elements according to chemical properties.  For example, elements in each Group of the periodic table (each vertical column) will share many of the same chemical properties. As we discuss the properties of elements and the ways they combine with other elements, the reasons for this particular arrangement of the periodic table will become more obvious.

	As you can see from [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/1.5.html Figure 1.5], each element in the periodic table is represented by a box containing the chemical symbol, the atomic number (the number of protons in the nucleus) and the atomic mass of the element.  Remember that the atomic mass is the weighted average of the masses of all of the natural isotopes of the particular element.

	Periodic tables are often colored, or shaded, to distinguish groups of elements that have similar properties or chemical reactivity.  The broadest classification is into metals, metalloids (or semi-metals) and nonmetals.  The elements in Groups 1A – 8A are called the representative elements and the elements in Groups 3 - 15 are called the transition metals. In [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/1.6.html Figure 1.6], the all of the metallic elements are shown in gray.  Metals are solids (except for mercury), can conduct electricity and are usually malleable (can be rolled into sheets) and are ductile (can be drawn into wires).  Metals are usually separated into the main group metals (the elements colored gray in Groups 1A - 5A) and the transition metals (in Groups 3 – 15).  Nonmetals (green in the Figure) do not conduct electricity (with the exception of carbon in the form of graphite) and have a variety of physical states (some are solids, some liquids and some gasses).  Two important subclasses of nonmetals are the halogens (Group 7A) and the inert gasses (or noble gasses;  Group 8A).  At the border between metals and nonmetals lie the elements boron, silicon, germanium, astatine, antimony and tellurium.  These elements share physical properties of metals and nonmetals and are called metalloids, or semi-metals.  The common semiconductors silicon and germanium are in this group and it is their unique electrical properties that make transistors and other solid-state devices possible.  Later in this book we will see that the position of elements in the periodic table also correlates with their chemical reactivity.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;1.3	Scientific Notation==
In Section 1.1, we stated that a single copper penny contains approximately 28,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 atoms.  This is a huge number.  If we were to measure the diameter of an atom of hydrogen, it would be about 0.00000000000026 inches across.  This is an incredibly small number.  Chemists routinely use very large and very small numbers in calculations.  In order to allow us to use this range of numbers efficiently, chemists will generally express numbers using exponential, or scientific notation.  In scientific notation, a number n is shown as the product of that number and 10, raised to some exponent x;  that is, (n × 10&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;).   The number 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is equal to 100.  If we multiply 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, that is equivalent to multiplying 2 × 100, or 200.  Thus 200 can be written in scientific notation as 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  When we convert a number to scientific notation, we begin by writing a the first (non-zero) digit in the number.  If the number contains more than one digit, we write a decimal point, followed by all of the remaining digits.  Next we inspect the number to see what power of 10 this decimal must be multiplied by to give the original number.  Operationally, what you are doing is moving decimal places.  Take the number of atoms in a penny, 28,000,000,000,000,000,000,000.  We would begin by writing 2.8.  To get the power of 10 that we need, we begin with the last digit in the number and count the number of places that we must move to the left to reach our new decimal point.  In this example, we must move 22 places to the left.  The number is therefore the product of 2.8 and 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;, and the number is written in scientific notation as 2.8 × 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt;.
 
	Let’s look at a very small number;  for example, 0.00000000000026 inches, the diameter of a hydrogen atom.  We want to place our decimal point between the two and the six.  To do this, we have to move the decimal point in our number to the right thirteen places.  When you are converting a number to scientific notation and you move the decimal point to the right, the power of 10 must have a negative exponent.  Thus our number would be written 2.6 × 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; inches.  A series of numbers in decimal format and in scientific notation are shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/T1.2.html Table 1.2].  [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/1.7.html Figure 1.7] shows a remarkable picture from an atomic force microscope in which individual atoms of sodium and chlorine are visualized on a sodium chloride crystal.  In this image, the size of the individual atoms is about 2.6 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-13&lt;/sup&gt;  meters.

'''Exercise 1.1  Conversions between Decimal Format and Scientific Notation'''
 Convert the following numbers into scientific notation:&lt;br&gt;
   a.  93,000,000&lt;br&gt;  b.  708,010&lt;br&gt;  c.  0.000248&lt;br&gt;  d.  800.0

 Convert the following numbers from scientific notation into decimal format:
   a.  6.02 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;  b.  6.00 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;  c.  4.68 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;  d.  9.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;

==&amp;#160;&amp;#160; 1.4	SI and Metric Units==
Within the sciences, we use the system of weights and measures that are defined by the International System of Units which are generally referred to as SI Units.  At the heart of the SI system is a short list of base units defined in an absolute way without referring to any other units. The base units that we will use in this text, and later in General Chemistry include the meter (m) for distance, the kilogram (kg) for mass and the second (s) for time.  The volume of a substance is a derived unit based on the meter, and a cubic meter (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is defined as the volume of a cube that is exactly 1 meter on all edges.  

	Because most laboratory work that takes place in chemistry is on a relatively small scale, the mass of a kilogram (about 2.2 pounds) is too large to be convenient and the gram is generally utilized, where a gram (g) is defined as 1/1000 kilograms.  Likewise, a volume of one cubic meter is too large to be practical in the laboratory and it is common to use the cubic centimeter to describe volume.  A cubic centimeter is a cube that is 1/100 meter on each edge, as shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/1.9.html Figure 1.9];  a teaspoon holds approximately 5 cubic centimeters.  For liquids and gasses, chemists will usually describe volume using the liter, where a liter (L) is defined as 1000 cubic centimeters. 

	SI base units are typically represented using the abbreviation for the unit itself, preceded by a metric prefix, where the metric prefix represents the power of 10 that the base unit is multiplied by.  The set of common metric prefixes are shown in Table 1.3.

&lt;br&gt;

	Using this Table as a reference, we see the metric symbol “c” represents the factor 10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;;  thus writing “cm” is equivalent to writing (10&lt;sup&gt;–2&lt;/sup&gt; × m).  Likewise, we could describe 1/1000 of a meter as mm, where the metric symbol “m” represents the factor 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;.  The set of metric prefixes and their symbols that are shown in Table 1.3 are widely used in chemistry and it is important that you memorize them and become adept at relating the prefix (and its’ symbol) to the corresponding factor of 10.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;1.5	Unit Conversion within the Metric System==
Because chemists often deal with measurements that are both very small (as in the size of an atom) and very large (as in numbers of atoms), it is often necessary to convert between units of metric measurement.  For example, a mass measured in grams may be more convenient to work with if it was expressed in mg (10&lt;sup&gt;–3&lt;/sup&gt; × g).  Converting between metric units is an exercise in unit analysis (also called dimensional analysis).  Unit analysis is a form of proportional reasoning where a given measurement can be multiplied by a known proportion or ratio to give a result having a different unit, or dimension.  For example, if you had a sample of a substance with a mass of 0.0034 grams and you wished to express that mass in mg you could use the following unit analysis:

	The given quantity in this example is the mass of 0.0034 grams.  The quantity that you want to find is the mass in mg, and the known proportion or ratio is given by the definition of the metric prefix, that is one mg is equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; grams.  Expressing this as a proportion or ratio, you could say there is one mg per 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; grams, or:
 
	Looking at this expression, the numerator, 1 mg, is equivalent to saying 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;–3&lt;/sup&gt; g, which is identical to the value in the denominator.  This ratio, therefore has a numeric value of one (anything divided by itself is one, by definition).  Algebraically, we know that we are allowed to multiply any number by one and that number will be unchanged.  If, however, the number has units, and we multiply it by a ratio containing units, the units in the number will multiply and divide by the units of the ratio, giving the original number (remember you are multiplying by one) but with different units.  In the present case, if we multiply the given by the known ratio, the unit “g” will cancel, leaving “mg” as the only remaining unit.  The original number in grams has therefore been converted to milligrams, the units that you wanted to find.
 
	The method that we used to solve this problem can be generalized as:
'''given × known ratio = find'''.
The given is a numerical quantity (with its units), the known ratio is based on the metric prefixes and is set up so that the units in the denominator of the ratio match the units of given and the units in the numerator match those in find.  When these are multiplied, the number from given will now have the units of find.  In the ratio used in the example, “g” (the units of given) appear in the denominator and “mg” (the units of find) appear in the numerator.

	As an example of a case where the units of the known ratio must be inverted, if you wanted to convert 1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; µg into grams, the given would be 1.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; µg, the find would be grams and the known ratio would be based on the definition of µg as one µg per 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; grams.  This ratio must be expressed in the solution with µg (the units of given) in the denominator and g (the units of find) in the numerator.  The problem is set up as:


Note that instead of “one µg per 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; grams”, we must invert the known ratio and state it as either “10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; grams per 1 µg” so that the units of given (µg) will cancel.  We can do this inversion because the ratio still has a numeric value of one.
	Simple ratios like these can also be used to convert English measurements in to their metric equivalents.  The ratio relating inches to meters is &lt;math&gt;\left( {}^{\text{0}\text{.0254 m}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{1 inch}}\; \right)&lt;/math&gt;.  Thus we could express the distance between atoms in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/1.8.html Figure 1.8] as:


 


'''Example 1.1  Simple Metric Unit Conversions'''

*a.	9.3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; g into ng
*b.	278 g into mg

'''Exercise 1.2  Simple Metric Unit Conversions'''
	Convert the following metric measurements into the indicated units:
*a.  2,057 grams - as kg 
*b.  1.25 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; meters - as µm 
*c.  6.58 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; meters - as km
*d.  2.78 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; grams - as mg

	In the examples we have done thus far, we have been able to write a known ratio based on the definition of the appropriate metric prefix.  But what if we wanted to take a number that was expressed in milligrams and convert it to a number with the units of nanograms?  In a case like this, we need to use two known ratios in sequence;  the first with the units of given (mg) in the denominator and the second with the units of find (ng) in the numerator.  For example, if we were given 0.00602 mg and asked to find ng, we could set up a ratio based on grams per mg.  If we solved the problem at this point, we would have a result with the units of grams.  To get a final answer in terms of ng, we would need to multiply this intermediate result (the new given) by a ratio based on nanograms per gram.  The complete set-up is shown below:

	In the first two terms, the units of “mg” cancel and in the second two terms, “g” cancels leaving only “ng”, the units of find.  One of the reassuring pleasures of doing these types of problems is that, if you set up your problem and the units cancel, leaving only the units of find, you know you have set up the problem correctly!  All you have to do is to do the sequential calculations and you know your answer is correct!

*d.  6.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; mm - into km

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;1.6	Significant Figures==
Experimental work in scientific laboratories will generally involve measurement.  Whenever we make a measurement, we always strive to make our value as accurate as possible.  For example, the ruler in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/1.9.html Figure 1.9] can be used to measure the distance between the two red arrows.

	The distance is more than 50 mm, the last numbered digit shown before the second arrow.  If we look very carefully, we see that the second arrow is about half-way between the fourth and fifth division following the 50 mm mark.  The measurement is therefore greater than 54 mm and less than 55 mm and is about 54.5 mm.  The last digit in our measurement is estimated, but the first two digits are exact.  In any measurement, like this, the last digit that you report is always an estimated digit.  If we were to say that the measurement was 54 mm, that would be incorrect, because we know it’s larger.  If we were to say the measurement was 54.5567 mm, that would be nonsense because our scale does not show that degree of accuracy.  In a measurement in science, the estimated digit is called the least significant digit, and the total number of exact digits plus the estimated digit is called the number of significant figures in the measurement.  Thus the measurement in the figure, 54.5, has three significant figures (3 SF).  By adhering to this rule, we can look at any measured value and immediately know the accuracy of the measurement that was done.
	In order to properly interpret the number of significant figures in a measurement, we have to know how to interpret measurements containing zeros.  For example, an object is found to have a mass of 602 mg.  The last digit (the 2) is estimated and the first two digits are exact.  The measurement therefore is accurate to three significant figures.  We could also express this measurement in grams using the metric conversion ratio  
&lt;math&gt;\left( {}^{\text{1 g}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{10}^{\text{3}}\text{ mg}}\; \right)&lt;/math&gt;, making the measurement 0.00602 g.  We now have three additional digits in our number (called leading zeros), but is our number any more accurate?  No;  in a measurement, leading zeros (zeros that appear before the number) are never significant.

	Let’s consider another measurement;  we are told that a distance is 1700 m.  The first thing to notice is that this number does not have a decimal point.  What this tells us is that the estimated digit in this number is the 7, and that this number only has two significant figures.  The last two zeros in this measurement are called trailing zeros;  in numbers without a decimal point, trailing zeros are never significant.  If, however, the distance was reported as 1700.00 m, the presence of the decimal point would imply that the last zero was the estimated digit (zeros can be estimated too) and this number would have six significant figures.  Stated as a rule, in a number containing a decimal point, trailing zeros are always significant.  These simple rules for interpreting zeros in measurements are collected in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/T1.4.html Table 1.4].

	Applying these rules to some examples:  

*117.880 m contains six significant figures;  the number has a decimal point, so the trailing zero is significant.
*0.002240 g contains four significant figures;  the number has a decimal point so the trailing zero is significant, but the leading zeros are not.
*1,000,100 contains five significant figures;  the number does not have a decimal point, so the trailing zeros are not significant.  The zeros between the first and fifth digits, however, are significant.
*6.022 × 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; contains four significant figures.  In scientific notation, all of the significant figures in a measurement are shown before the exponent.  (Remember this when you are converting measurements into scientific notation.)

'''Exercise 1.4  Significant Figures in Measurements'''
	Determine the number of significant figures in each of the following numbers:

*a. 	2,057,000 	
*b.	1.250600	
*c.  	9.300 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;	
*d.  	6.05 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; 

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;1.7	Atomic Theory and Electron Configuration==
As we learned in Section 1.1, modern atomic theory places protons and neutrons in the nucleus of an atom and electrons are placed in a diffuse cloud surrounding this nucleus.  As chemists and physicists began examining the structure of atoms, however, it became apparent that all of the electrons in atoms were not equivalent.  The electrons were not randomly placed in one massive “cloud”, rather they seemed to be arranged in distinct energy levels and energy was required to move electrons from a lower to a higher energy level.  A mathematical model of atomic structure was developed in the early nineteenth century that defined these energy levels as quantum levels, and today this description is generally referred to as quantum mechanics.

	According to the quantum model of the atom, electron for the known elements can reside in seven different quantum levels, denoted by the principal quantum number ''n'', where ''n'' has a value of one to seven. As the quantum number increases, the average energy of the electrons having that quantum number also increases.  Each of the seven rows in the periodic table shown in Figure 1.5 corresponds to a different quantum number. The first row (''n'' = 1) can only accommodate two electrons.  Thus an element in the first row of the periodic table can have no more than two electrons (hydrogen has one, and helium has two).  The second row (''n'' = 2) can accommodate eight electrons and an element in the second row of the periodic table will have two electrons in the first level (it is full) and up to eight electrons in the second level. 

	Quantum theory also tells us that the electrons in a given energy level are not all equivalent.  Within an energy level electrons reside within sublevels (or subshells).  The sublevels for any given level are identified by the letters, s, p, d and f and the total number of sublevels is also given by the quantum number, ''n''.   The s sublevel can accommodate two electrons, the p holds six, the d holds 10 and the f can hold 14.  The elements in the first row in the periodic table (''n'' = 1) have electrons only in the 1s sublevel (''n'' = 1, therefore there can only be one sublevel).  The single electron in hydrogen would be identified as 1s1 and the two electrons in helium would be identified as 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Fluorine, in the second row of the periodic table (n = 2), has an atomic number of nine and therefore has nine electrons.  The electrons in fluorine are arranged, two in the first level (1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), two in the 2s suborbital (2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and five 2p suborbital (2p&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;).  If we were to write the electron configuration for fluorine, we would write it as 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.  Each of the sublevels in an atom is also associated with an orbital, where an orbital is simply a region of space where the electron is likely to be found.  [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/1.10.html Figure 1.10] shows the calculated shapes for the s, p and d orbitals;  the shapes of the seven f orbitals are even more complex.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;1.8	Filling Orbitals with Electrons==
As stated above, an s sublevel can accommodate two electrons, the p accommodates  six, there can be 10 in the d sublevel and 14 in the f.  Although there are two electrons in the s sublevel, these electrons are not identical; they differ in the quantum property known as spin.  As a simple device to illustrate this, the electrons within a suborbital are often represented as arrows pointing up or down, graphically representing opposite spin axes (↑ and ↓).  Electrons are added to sublevels according to Hund’s rules which state that every orbital in a subshell is singly occupied with one electron before any one orbital is doubly occupied, and all electrons in singly occupied orbitals have the same spin.  When a subshell is doubly occupied, the electrons have opposite spins.  For example, carbon has a filled 1s sublevel, a filled 2s sublevel and two electrons in the 2p sublevel (2p&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).  We could therefore show the electrons of carbon as:
 
The electron configuration for fluorine is 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;,  so we could show the electrons in fluorine as:
 
	This sequence continues nicely until the third period;  it turns out the 3d orbitals are slightly higher in energy than the 4s orbital, therefore the 4s fills with two electrons, and then the next 10 electrons are placed in the 3d orbital.  This is a general trend in the periodic table, and the order of filling can be easily predicted by the scheme shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/1.11.html Figure 1.11].  In this scheme, you simply follow the arrows on the diagonal to determine the next orbital to fill.

	One of the shortcuts that is often used when writing electron configuration is to show “core” electrons simply as the inert gas from the preceding period.  For example, fluorine is in the second period (n = 2).  That means that the orbitals associated with the first period are already filled, just like they are in the inert gas, helium (He).  Therefore, instead of writing the configuration for fluorine as we did above,  we can replace the 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; with the “helium core”, or:
 
	Calcium is in the fourth period and in Group 2A.  That means that the first three quantum levels are filled (''n'' = 1, 2 and 3) just like they are in argon.  Therefore, the electron configuration for calcium can be written as:
 
Note that in this example, the 3d orbitals are shown as next in line to receive electrons.  In [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/1.12.html Figure 1.12], aster the 4s sublevel fills, 3d is next, followed by 4p, etc.


'''Exercise 1.5  Electron Configurations'''

*b.  Identify the elements corresponding to the following electron configurations: 
1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  and 
1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. 

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160; Study Points==
*Matter is defined as any substance that has mass.  Matter is composed of atoms. that are constructed primarily from neutrons, protons and electrons.  Neutrons have no charge, protons, carry a positive charge, and electrons, have a negative charge.  
*The mass of atoms and subatomic particles is measured using atomic mass units (abbreviated amu);  protons and neutrons have a mass of one amu, and the mass of an electron is negligible.  
*The neutron and the proton are in the center of the atom in the nucleus.  Virtually all of the mass of the atom resides in the nucleus.  Electrons are placed in a diffuse cloud surrounding the nucleus.  
*The electron cloud carries a net negative charge and in a neutral atom there are always as many electrons in this cloud as there are protons in the nucleus.
*The identity of an atom is defined by the number of protons in its nucleus; each unique type of atom is called an element. Elements with the same number of protons, but differing numbers of neutrons in their nucleus are called isotopes.  The atomic mass of an element is the weighted average of the masses each of these isotopes.
*Each element is referred to using its chemical symbol, which is an abbreviation of its name (many symbols are based on Latin or Greek names).
*The atomic symbol for an element consists of the chemical symbol with the atomic number for the element as a subscript, preceding the chemical symbol, and directly above this, a superscript showing the mass number for the particular isotope of the element.
*The average atomic mass for an element can be calculated as the sum of the fraction of each isotope within the natural abundance, multiplied by the mass number of that isotope;  or, average atomic mass =  f&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;M&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; …
*The number of protons in the nucleus of an element is called the atomic number of that element.  Elements are typically arranged in order of increasing atomic numbers in the periodic table. In the periodic table, horizontal rows are called periods  and vertical columns are called groups. 
*Typically in the sciences, very large or very small numbers are shown using scientific notation (exponential notation) where a number'' n'' is shown as the product of that number and 10, raised to some exponent x;  that is, (''n'' × 10&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;).
*In the SI (or metric) system, the unit for distance is the meter (m), kilogram (kg) is used for mass and second (s) for time.  The volume of a substance is a derived unit based on the meter, and a cubic meter (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is defined as the volume of a cube that is exactly 1 meter on all edges.  Typically, in the laboratory, mass is expressed in grams (g) (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;1000&lt;/sub&gt; of a kilogram) and the cubic centimeter (cc) is to describe volume.  A cubic centimeter is a cube that is &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;100&lt;/sub&gt; meter on each edge.  For liquids and gasses, volume is usually described using the liter, where a liter (L) is defined as 1000 cubic centimeters. 
*SI base units are typically represented using the abbreviation for the unit itself, preceded by a metric prefix, where the metric prefix represents the power of 10 that the base unit is multiplied by.
*When converting between metric units, a simple algorithm involves taking a given measurement and multiplying it by a known proportion or ratio to give a result having the metric unit, or dimension, that you were trying to find.
*In a measurement in science, the last digit that is reported is estimated, and this digit is called the least significant digit; this, along with the total number of exact digits plus the estimated digit is called the number of significant figures in the measurement.  When identifying the number of significant figures in a measurement, all leading zeros are excluded.  Zeros that are surrounded by non-zero digits are included, and, for numbers with a decimal point, trailing zeros are also included.  If a number does not have a decimal point, trailing zeros are not included.  A number written in scientific notation includes all significant digits in ''n'';  (''n'' × 10&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;).
*According to the quantum model of the atom, electrons reside in seven different quantum levels, denoted by the principal quantum number n, where n has a value of one to seven, corresponding to the seven rows in the periodic table. The first row (n = 1) can accommodate two electrons; the second row (''n'' = 2) can accommodate eight electrons; the third row (n = 3), eighteen, up to a maximum of 2''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for the known elements.
*Quantum theory also tells us that the electrons in a given energy level reside within sublevels (or subshells).  The sublevels for any given level are identified by the letters, s, p, d and f and the quantum number for the level, written as 1s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 2p&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, etc.  Each of the sublevels is also associated with an orbital, where an orbital is simply a region of space where the electron is likely to be found. 
*When adding electrons to sublevels, Hund’s rules state that every orbital in a subshell is singly occupied with one electron before any one orbital is doubly occupied, and all electrons in singly occupied orbitals have the same spin (shown using “up and down” arrows). Electrons are added in order of increasing energy of the sublevel, not necessarily in numeric order.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;big&gt;'''Chapter 2. The Physical and Chemical Properties of Matter'''&lt;/big&gt;==


== &amp;#160;&amp;#160; 2.1  Pure Substances and Mixtures ==
In Chapter 1, we learned that atoms are composed of electrons, protons and neutrons and that the number of protons in the nucleus of an atom (the atomic number) defines the identity of that element. For example, an atom with six protons in its nucleus is a carbon atom; seven protons make&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; it nitrogen; eight protons makes it oxygen, and so on. The periodic table organizes these elements by atomic number and there are currently over 116 known elements.

Because there are ''clearly ''more than 116 different ''types'' of substances in the world around us, we can see that most substances that we encounter are ''not'' pure elements, but are composed of different elements combined together. In chemistry, we refer to these as '''compounds''', which we define as ''a substance that results from the combination of two or more elements in a constant ratio. ''For example, water is a compound composed of two hydrogen atoms ''bonded'' to one oxygen atom. We can show the ratio of hydrogen to oxygen in this compound by using subscripts on the chemical symbols for each element. Thus, water (two hydrogens and one oxygen) can be written as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This shorthand notation for water is called a '''chemical formula'''. For any compound, the chemical formula tells us the elements that are present and the ''ratio'' of the elements to each other.  Later we will see that water is a member of a special sub-type of compound, called a molecular compound. In a '''molecule''', the atoms are not only bonded together in a constant ratio, but they are bonded in a ''specific geometric arrangement'' as well [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.1.html (Figure 2.1)]. In the following chapter, we will look more closely at how elements are bonded together in compounds, but first we will examine some of the properties of chemical substances.

When we speak of a '''pure substance''', we are speaking of something that contains only one kind of matter. This can either be one single element or one single compound, but every sample of this substance that you examine must contain exactly the same thing with a fixed, definite set of properties. If we take two or more pure substances and mix them together, we refer to this as a '''mixture. '''Mixtures can always be separated again into component pure substances,because ''bonding'' among the atoms of the constituent substances does not occur in a mixture. Whereas a compound may have very different properties from the elements that compose it, in mixtures the substances keep their individual properties. For example sodium is a soft shiny metal and chlorine is a pungent green gas. These two elements can combine to form the compound, sodium chloride (table salt) which is a white, crystalline solid having ''none'' of the properties of either sodium or chlorine. If, however, you ''mixed'' table salt with ground pepper, you would still be able to see the individual grains of each of them and, if you were patient, you could take tweezers and carefully separate them back into pure salt and pure pepper.[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.2.html (Figure 2.2)]

Mixtures fall into two types, based on the uniformity of their composition. The first, called a '''heterogeneous mixture''', is distinguished by the fact that different samples of the mixture may have a different composition. For example, if you open a container of mixed nuts and pull out a series of small samples and examine them, the exact ratio of peanuts-to-almonds in the samples will always be slightly different, no matter how carefully you mix them. Common examples of heterogeneous mixtures include dirt, gravel and vegetable soup.[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.3.html (Figure 2.3)]

In a '''homogeneous mixture, '''on the other hand, any sample that you examine will have exactly the ''same'' composition as any other sample. Within chemistry, the most common type of homogeneous mixture is a '''solution''' which is one substance dissolved completely within another. Think of a solution of pure sugar dissolved in pure water [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.4.html (Figure 2.4)]. Any sample of the solution that you examine will have ''exactly'' the same ratio of sugar-to-water, which means that it is a homogeneous mixture. Even in a homogeneous mixture, the properties of the components are generally recognizable. Thus, sugar-water tastes sweet (like sugar) and is wet (like water). Unlike a compound, which has a fixed, definite ratio, in a mixture one can vary the amounts of each component. For example, when you add a little sugar to one cup of tea and a lot of sugar to another, each cup will contain a homogeneous mixture of tea and sugar but they will have a different taste. If you add so much sugar that some does not dissolve and stays on the bottom, however, the mixture is no longer homogeneous, it is heterogeneous;you could easily separate the two components.

&lt;br /&gt;

'''[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex2.1.html Exercise 2.1]  Distinguishing Substances &amp; Mixtures'''


== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;2.2  The States of Matter ==


As described in Section 2.1, a molecule of water is composed of two atoms of hydrogen bonded to one atom of oxygen(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). All water molecules are exactly the same (same ratio of elements, same geometric bonding pattern), but we encounter water in three different forms in the world around us. At low temperature, water exists as a solid (ice). As the temperature increases, water exists as a liquid, and at high temperature, as water vapor, a gas. An example in which these three states (or phases) exist simultaneously is shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.5.html Figure 2.5]. These three forms of water represent the three '''states of matter'''&lt;nowiki&gt;: solids, liquids and gases. States of matter are examples of &lt;/nowiki&gt;'''physical properties''' of a substance. Other physical properties include appearance (shiny, dull, smooth, rough), odor, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, hardness and density, to name just a few. We will discuss density in more detail in the next section, but first let’s examine the states of matter and how they differ on an atomic level.

If ice, liquid water and water vapor all consist of identical molecules, then what accounts for the difference in their properties? So far, we have talked about molecules as if they were standing still, but in fact, they are always moving. In chemistry, we often explain the states of matter in terms of the '''kinetic molecular theory (KMT)'''. The word ''kinetic'' refers to motion and the kinetic molecular theory suggests that atoms and molecules are ''always'' in motion.  The energy associated with this motion is termed ''kinetic energy. ''The amount of kinetic energy that a particle has is a direct function of temperature, and it is the kinetic energy of the water molecules under different conditions that determines the different properties of the three states of water as shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.5.html Figure 2.5].

Atoms and molecules move in different ways under different conditions because of the forces attracting them to each other, called '''intermolecular forces'''. ''' '''''Intermolecular forces'' is a general term describing the fact that all atoms, and molecules share a certain inherent ''attraction ''for each other. These attractive forces are much weaker than the bonds that hold molecules together, but in a large cluster of atoms or molecules the sum of all of these attractive forces can be quite significant.

Now, consider a group of molecules or atoms clustered together and held in place by these attractive forces. At low temperature, the molecules or atoms will remain stuck together in a ''lump'' of defined shape and structure, like water in the form of an ice cube. This is referred to as the '''solid phase'''. At the atomic level, the molecules or atoms in a solid are closely packed, and although they are still all rapidly moving, their movements are so small that they can be thought of as vibrating about a fixed position. As an analogy here, think of a handful of small magnets stuck together in a solid mass [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.6.html (Figure 2.6)].  Solids and liquids are the most tightly packed states of matter. Because of the intermolecular forces, solids have a defined shape, which is independent of the container in which they are placed.  
As energy is added to the system, usually in the form of heat, the individual molecules or atoms acquire enough energy to overcome some of the attractive intermolecular''' '''forces between them so that neighboring particles are free to move past or slide over one another. This state of matter is called the '''liquid phase'''. As in a solid, in a liquid, the attractive forces are strong enough to hold the molecules or atoms close together so they are not easily compressed and have a definite volume. Unlike in a solid, however, the particles will flow (slide over each other) so that they can assume the shape of their container, as shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.7.html Figure 2.7].

Finally, if enough energy is put into the system, the individual molecules or atoms acquire enough energy to totally break all of the attractive forces between them and they are free to separate and rapidly move throughout the entire volume of their container. This is called the '''gas phase''' and atoms or molecules in the gas phase will totally fill whatever container they occupy, taking on the shape and volume of their container. Because there is so much space between the particles in a gas, a gas is ''highly compressible, ''which means that the molecules can be forced closer together to fit in a much smaller space [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.8.html (Figure 2.8)]''. '' We are all familiar with cylinders of compressed gas, where the compressibility of gasses is exploited to allow a large amount of gas to be transported in a very small space. [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.9.html Figure 2.9] shows a simple graphic representation of the atomic states in solids, liquids and gasses.

Returning to our example of water, at low temperature, water exists as the solid, ice. As the solid is warmed, the water molecules acquire enough energy to overcome the strongest of the attractive forces between them and the ice ''melts ''to form liquid water. This transition from the solid phase to the liquid phase happens at a fixed temperature for each substance called the '''melting point'''. The melting point of a solid is one of the physical properties of that solid. If we remove energy from the liquid molecules they will slow down enough for the attractive forces to take hold again and a solid will form. The temperature that this happens is called the '''freezing point''' and is the same temperature as the melting point.

As more energy is put into the system, the water heats up, the molecules begin moving faster and faster until there is finally enough energy in the system to totally overcome the attractive forces. When this happens, the water molecules are free to fly away from each other, fill whatever container they are occupying and become a gas. The transition from the liquid phase to the gas phase happens at a fixed temperature for each substance and is called the '''boiling point'''. Like the melting point, the boiling point is another physical property of a liquid.

Phase transitions for a typical substance can be shown using simple diagram showing the physical states, separated by transitions for melting and boiling points. For example, if you are told that a pure substance is 15˚ C above its boiling point, you can use the diagram to plot the temperature relative to the boiling point. Because you are above the boiling point, the substance will exist in the '''''gas phase.'''''

&lt;br&gt;

'''[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp2.1.html Example 2.1] The Physical State of a Substance'''

There are, however, some exceptions to the rules for changes of state that we have just established,. For example, ice is a solid and the molecules in the interior are held together tightly by intermolecular forces. Surface molecules, however, are exposed and they have the opportunity to absorb energy from the environment (think of a patch of snow on a bright sunny day). If some of these surface molecules absorb enough energy, they can break the attractive forces that are holding them and escape as a gas (water vapor) without ever going through the liquid phase. The transition from a solid directly into a gas is called '''sublimation'''. The reverse process, a direct transition from a gas to a solid, is called '''deposition'''. Perhaps the most common example of a solid that does not melt, but ''only'' sublimes, is dry ice (solid carbon dioxide;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.10.html Figure 2.10]. This property of dry ice is what makes it a good refrigerant for shipping perishables. It is quite cold, keeping things well frozen, but does not melt into a messy liquid as it warms during shipment.

Just like surface molecules in solids can move directly into the gas phase, surface molecules in liquids also absorb energy from the environment and move into the gas phase, even though the liquid itself is below the boiling point. This is the process of '''vaporization '''(evaporation). The reverse process, a transition from a gas to a liquid, is called '''condensation'''. Liquid substances undergo vaporization and&lt;span&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;the space above any liquid has molecules of that substance in the gas state. This is called the '''vapor pressure''' of the liquid, and vapor pressure (at a given temperature) is another of the physical properties of liquid substances.

Summarizing what we know about the different states of matter:

In a '''gas'''&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;

* the molecules or atoms are highly separated, making a gas highly compressible,
* attractive forces between the particles are ''minimal'', allowing the gas to take on the shape and volume of its container.

In a '''liquid'''&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;

* the molecules or atoms are closely spaced, making a liquid much less compressible than a gas,
* attractive forces between the particles are ''intermediate'', allowing the molecules or atoms to move past, or slide over one another,
* liquids have a definite volume, but will take on the shape of their container.

In a '''solid'''&lt;nowiki&gt;:&lt;/nowiki&gt;

* the attractive forces are strong, keeping the atoms or molecules in relatively fixed positions,
* the neighboring atoms or molecules are close together, making the solid not compressible and giving it a definite shape that is independent of the shape and size of its container.

&lt;br&gt;

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;2.3 Density, Proportionality and Dimensional Analysis ==

In the previous section, we have learned about the states of matter. The physical state of a substance at under a defined set of conditions (like temperature and pressure) is an '''intensive property''' of a substance. An intensive property is defined as a property that is inherent to the substance and is not dependent on the sample size. '''Density''', the mass-to-volume ratio of a substance, is another example of an intensive property.[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.11.html (Figure 2.11)]

If you picked up equal sized samples of aluminum and gold, you would immediately notice that one was much heavier than the other. The atomic mass of gold is over seven times greater than the atomic mass of aluminum, so although the two samples are the same size, the lump of gold is significantly more massive than the equally sized lump of aluminum. We can say that gold is more ''dense'' than aluminum.

Making this a quantitative measurement, one cubic centimeter of gold has a mass of 19.3 grams (remember that a cubic centimeter is the volume of a cube that is exactly one cm on each side, and it has the units of cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.12.html ;see Figure 2.12]. We defined density as the mass-to-volume ratio of a substance. For gold, the mass is 19.3 grams and the volume is 1 cm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The mass-to-volume ratio of gold is 
&lt;math&gt;\left( {}^{19.3\text{ g}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{1 cm}^{\text{3}}}\; \right)&lt;/math&gt;, and the density (''d'') of gold is written as ''d'' = 19.3 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

Returning to our block of aluminum;experimentally, one cubic centimeter of aluminum has a mass of 2.70 grams. The mass-to-volume ratio of aluminum is 
&lt;math&gt;\left( {}^{2.\text{70 g}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{1 cm}^{\text{3}}}\; \right)&lt;/math&gt;, and the density of aluminum is therefore 2.70 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, about 7 times ''less'' than that of gold.

Density is a physical property that can be measured for all substances, solids, liquids and gasses. For solids and liquids, density is often reported using the units of g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Densities of gasses, which are significantly lower than the densities of solids and liquids, are often given using units grams/liter (g/L, remembering from Section 1.4 that a liter is defined as 1000 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Table2.1.html Table 2.1] gives the densities of some common solids, liquids and gasses.

The definition of density that we used previously was ''the mass-to-volume ratio of a substance''. This is also stated as “mass ''per'' unit volume”. The word ''per'' in this context implies that a mathematical relationship exists between mass and volume. In this case, the relationship is the ratio of mass-to-volume. Whenever two factors can be related by a ''ratio'' or fraction we can use ''unit''''' '''''analysis''''' '''to solve problems relating those factors. For density, the ratio is mass-to-volume. If a sample of iron has a mass of 23.4 grams and a volume of 3.00 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the density of iron can be calculated as:

''d'' = &lt;math&gt;\left( {}^{\text{mass}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{volume}}\; \right)&lt;/math&gt;

''d'' = &lt;math&gt;\left( {}^{2\text{3}\text{.4 g}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{3}\text{.00 cm}^{\text{3}}}\; \right)&lt;/math&gt;
or,    ''d'' = 7.80 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;

In this calculation, our two experimental numbers are 23.4 and 3.00. Each of these numbers has ''three significant figures'' (remember, the trailing zeros in 3.00 are significant because the number has a decimal point). Our answer must therefore ''also'' be accurate to three significant figures, or 7.80.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;2.4 Chemical Properties, Physical Changes and Chemical Changes ==


A lump of gold can be hammered into a very thin sheet of gold foil (it is the most ''malleable'' of all of the elements). Nonetheless, the gold in the foil sheet is still just elemental gold;nothing has changed except the physical appearance of the sample. The same is true if you take any solid pure substance and melt it, or convert it to a gas. The atomic or molecular structure of the substance has not changed, it simply has a different physical appearance. Changes in outward appearances that do not alter the chemical nature of the substance and make no new substance are called '''physical changes'''. Pure carbon, in the form of a briquette, can be smashed to a fine power without changing the fact that it is still just elemental carbon (thus, this is a physical change), but if pure carbon is heated in the presence of oxygen, something else happens. The carbon slowly disappears (often in flames) and the carbon atoms now appear as a compound with oxygen with the formula CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Carbon dioxide is a totally different substance than either the carbon or the oxygen that we started with. For example, carbon is a black solid and carbon dioxide is a colorless gas. You know that a '''chemical change''' has occurred when the chemical composition of the material changes and a new substance is produced.[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.13.html (Figure 2.13)]

Just like we defined a set of physical properties for substances, we can also define a set of '''chemical properties'''. Chemical properties are simply the set of chemical changes that are possible for that substance. For the element magnesium (Mg), we could say that chemical properties include:

* the reaction with oxygen to form MgO,
* the reaction with hydrochloric acid to form MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and hydrogen gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;),
* the reaction with solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) to form MgO and carbon.

Chemical changes can almost always be detected with one of our physical senses. Thus, when magnesium reacts with oxygen (burns in air) a bright white flame is produced, heat is evolved and the shiny metallic magnesium is converted to a crumbly white powder (MgO; [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.14.html (Figure 2.14a)]. In the reaction with hydrochloric acid (the molecule HCl dissolved in water), the solid metallic magnesium disappears, bubbles of hydrogen gas (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) are evolved, heat is produced, and a clear solution containing MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is formed [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.14.html (Figure 2.14b)]. In the reaction with solid carbon dioxide (dry ice), a bright white flame is produced, heat is evolved and the shiny metallic magnesium is converted to a crumbly white powder and solid carbon [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.14.html (Figure 2.14c)]. In general, when you are trying to identify a chemical change, look for evidence of heat or light, the evolution of a gas, a change in color or the formation of new solid products from otherwise clear solutions.

&lt;br&gt;

'''[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex2.4.html Exercise 2.4] Chemical and Physical Changes'''

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;2.5  Conservation of Mass and Chemical Changes ==

When substances undergo chemical changes their physical state is usually dramatically altered. Despite this dramatic change, however, no matter is lost or created. We can show this with the reaction of magnesium metal with oxygen to form magnesium oxide [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/2.14.html (Figure 2.14)]. Instead of burning the magnesium metal openly in the air, if you were to ''seal'' the magnesium and air together in a glass vessel, weigh it, heat it to promote reaction, and then weigh the vessel again, you would find that there was ''no change'' in total mass. The mass of the product, magnesium oxide, would ''exactly'' equal the masses of the substances that reacted (oxygen gas and magnesium metal).

This is analogous to an experiment performed by the French chemist, Lavoisier, in the 1770s in which he heated metallic tin (Sn) with air in a closed vessel. This, and other experiments of the time, provided the data that led to the '''law of mass conservation'''. Formally, the law states, ''there is no detectable change in the total mass of materials when they react chemically to form new materials''.

Basically, what the ''conservation law'' says is that whenever a chemical change occurs, the total mass of the substances reacting must equal the total mass of the substances that are produced. Sometimes this is stated as ''mass is conserved'' or ''mass is neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. '' For example, when charcoal is burned in oxygen, the mass of the (charcoal + oxygen) must equal the mass of the (carbon dioxide, water vapor and ash) that is produced. The conservation of mass is one of the fundamental principles on which modern chemistry is based.

&lt;br&gt;

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;Study Points ==

* A '''compound''' is defined as a substance that results from the combination of two or more elements in a constant ratio. In a compound such as water, we show the ratio of the elements (hydrogen and oxygen) by using ''subscripts'' on the chemical symbols for each element. Thus, water (two hydrogens and one oxygen) is written using the '''chemical formula''' H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. In a '''molecule''', the atoms are not only bonded together in a constant ratio, but they are also bonded in a ''specific geometric arrangement''.
* A '''pure substance''' contains only one kind of matter;it can be a single element or a single chemical compound. Two or more pure substances mixed together constitute a mixture;you can always separate a mixture by simple physical means.
* A '''heterogeneous mixture''' is not uniform and different samples of the mixture will have a different compositions. A '''homogeneous mixture''',''' '''is uniform and any sample that you examine will have ''exactly'' the same composition as any other sample. Within chemistry, the most common type of homogeneous mixture is a '''solution'''.
* Any pure substance, under appropriate conditions, can exist in three different '''states'''&lt;nowiki&gt;: solids, liquids and gases. States of matter are examples of &lt;/nowiki&gt;'''physical properties''' of a substance. Other physical properties include appearance (shiny, dull, smooth, rough), odor, electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, hardness and density, etc.
* '''Solids''' have both a definite shape and volume. '''Liquids''' have a definite volume, but take on the shape of their container. '''Gasses''' have neither a definite shape nor volume, and both of these are defined by the shape and volume of their container. 
* The '''kinetic molecular theory (KMT)''' is generally used to explain physical states of matter. The KMT suggests that atoms and molecules are ''always'' in motion and are loosely bound to each other by attractive called '''intermolecular forces'''. In a '''solid''', the kinetic energy (energy of motion) associated with the atoms or molecules is insufficient to break these forces and the particles are essentially fixed in place, adjacent to each other. In a '''liquid''', there is enough kinetic energy to break some of the attractive forces, allowing the particles to “slip and slide” next to each other, but there is not enough energy to allow them to escape. In a '''gas''', there is sufficient kinetic energy to totally overcome the forces and the particles have no interactions with each other. 
* A change of state from a solid to a liquid occurs at a defined temperature (which) called the '''melting point''' (or freezing point);this temperature is a unique physical property of the substance. The transition from a liquid to a gas, likewise, occurs at the '''boiling point'''. A direct transition from a solid to a gas is called '''sublimation'''. 
* An '''intensive property''' is defined as a property that is ''inherent'' to the substance and is not dependent on the sample size. '''Density''', the ratio of mass-to-volume for a substance, is a classic example of an intensive property. 
* '''Density''' is calculated by taking the '''mass''' of a sample of a substance, and dividing that by the '''volume''' of that sample. Density for solids is typically expressed using units of grams per cubic centimeter (g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;);liquids as grams per milliliter (g mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and gasses as grams per liter (g L&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), although any mixture of mass and volume units may be used. Remember, a mL has the same volume as a cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and a L is simply 1000 mL. 
* '''Physical changes''' are changes in outward appearances that do not alter the chemical nature of the substance and produce no new substance.  When a '''chemical change''' occurs, a new substance is produced.  Just like physical properties describe the appearance or intensive properties of a substance, '''chemical properties''' describe the set of chemical changes that are possible for that substance. 
* The '''law of mass conservation''' (conservation of mass) simply states, that there is no detectable change in the total mass of materials when they react chemically (undergo a chemical change) to form new substances.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''3.1 Compounds, Lewis Diagrams and Ionic Bonds'''==

If we take two or more atoms and bond them together chemically so that they now behave as a single substance, we have made a chemical compound. We will see that the process of bonding actually involves either the ''sharing'', or the net ''transfer'', of electrons from one atom to another. The two types of bonding are '''covalent''', for the sharing of electrons between atoms, and '''ionic''', for the net transfer of electrons between atoms. Covalent or ionic bonding will determine the ''type'' of compound that will be formed.

In Chapter 1, we used atomic theory to describe the structure of the fluorine atom. We said that neutral fluorine has nine protons in its nucleus (an atomic number of 9), nine electrons surrounding the nucleus (to make it neutral), and the most common isotope has ten neutrons in its nucleus, for a mass number of 19. Further, we said that the nine electrons exist in two energy levels; the first energy level contains two electrons and is written 1''s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. The second energy level contains seven electrons, distributed as 2''s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' 2''p&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.'' The ''outermost'' electron level in any atom is referred to as the '''valence shell'''. For the representative elements (remember, this includes all of the elements except for the transition metals), the number of electrons in the valence shell corresponds to the Group number of the element in the periodic table. Group 1A elements will have one valence electron, Group 6A elements will have six valence electrons, and so on. Fluorine is a Group 7A element and has seven valence electrons. We can show the electron configuration for fluorine using a '''Lewis diagram''' (or ''electron-dot structure''), named after the American chemist G. N. Lewis, who proposed the concepts of electron shells and valence electrons. In a Lewis diagram, the electrons in the valence shell are shown as small “dots” surrounding the atomic symbol for the element.[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Eq3.1.html Equation 1]

When more than four electrons are present in the valence shell, they are shown as pairs when writing the Lewis diagram (but never more than pairs). Lewis diagrams for the atoms in the second period are shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/3.1.html Figure 3.1]. As you look at the dot-structures in Figure 3.1, please understand that it makes ''no difference'' where you place the electrons, or the electron pairs, around the symbol, as long as pairs are shown whenever there are four or more valence electrons.

If you examine the Lewis diagram for neon (Ne) in Figure 3.1, you will see that the valence shell is ''filled''&lt;nowiki&gt;; that is, there are eight electrons in the valence shell. Elements in Group 8A of the periodic table are called &lt;/nowiki&gt;''noble gasses''&lt;nowiki&gt;; they are very stable and do not routinely combine with other elements to form compounds (although today, many compounds containing noble gasses are known). Modern bonding theory tells us that this stability arises because the valence shell in the noble gasses is completely filled. When the valence shell is &lt;/nowiki&gt;''not'' full, theory suggests that atoms will transfer or share electrons with other atoms in order to achieve a filled valence shell… that is, the electron configuration of the noble gasses. Chemical bonding can then be viewed as a quest by atoms to acquire (or lose) enough electrons so that their valence shells are filled, that is, to achieve a “noble gas configuration”. This is often referred to as the “'''octet rule'''”; the desire for elements to obtain eight electrons in the valence shell (except of course for helium where the noble gas configuration is ''two'' valence electrons).

Atoms can achieve a noble gas configuration by two methods; the transfer of electrons from their valence shells to another atom, or by sharing electrons with another atom. If you examine the Lewis diagram for lithium (Li), you will see that it has only one valence electron. If lithium was to ''transfer'' this electron to another atom, it would be left with two electrons in the 1''s''-orbital (denoted as 1''s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''). This is the same electron configuration as helium (He), and so by losing this electron, lithium has achieved a ''noble gas configuration''. Because electrons carry a negative charge, the loss of this electron leaves lithium with a single positive charge. This is the '''lithium cation''' and it is shown as Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Eq3.2.html Equation 2]

Returning to fluorine (F), in order to achieve the 2''s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' 2''p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'' configuration of neon (Ne), fluorine needs to ''gain'' one valence electron. Because fluorine has ''gained'' one electron, it now has one negative charge. This is the fluoride anion and it is shown as F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. The transfer of electrons in order to achieve a noble gas configuration is the process known as '''ionic bonding''', and this will be covered in more detail later in this chapter.[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Eq3.3.html Equation 3]

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp3.1.html '''Example 3.1 Drawing Lewis Diagrams''']

  Sodium and chlorine are both third-period elements. Draw Lewis diagrams for each of these elements.


[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex3.1.html '''Exercise 3.1 Drawing Lewis Diagrams ''']

  Examine the solution in Example 3.1; what number of electrons would chlorine have to gain &lt;br&gt;  in order to achieve a “noble gas configuration”? What would be the &lt;br&gt;  charge on chlorine?

  Again, examine Example 3.1; what number of electrons would Na have to &lt;br&gt;  lose to obtain the noble gas configuration of Ne with ''eight'' &lt;br&gt;  valence electrons? What charge would Na have?

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''3.2 Covalent Bonding'''==

A second method by which atoms can achieve a filled valence shell is by ''sharing'' valence electrons with another atom. Thus fluorine, with one unpaired valence electron, can share that electron with an unshared electron on another fluorine to form the compound, F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in which the two shared electrons form a chemical bond holding the two fluorine atoms together [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/3.2.html (Figure 3.2)]. When you do this, each fluorine now has the equivalent of eight electrons in its valence shell; three unshared pairs and one pair that is ''shared'' between the two atoms. Note that when you are counting electrons, the electrons that are shared in the covalent bond are counted for each atom, individually. A chemical bond formed by ''sharing'' electrons between atoms is called a '''covalent bond'''. When two or more atoms are bonded together utilizing covalent bonds, the compound is referred to as a '''molecule'''.

There is a simple method, given below, that we can use to construct Lewis diagrams for diatomic and for polyatomic molecules:

Begin by adding up all of the ''valence electrons'' in the molecule. For F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, each fluorine has seven, giving a total of 14 valence electrons.

Next, draw your ''central atom''. For a diatomic molecule like F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, both atoms are the same, but if several different atoms are present, the ''central atom'' will be to the ''left'' (or lower) in the periodic table.

Next, draw the other atoms around the ''central atom'', placing two electrons ''between'' the atoms to form a covalent bond.

Distribute the remaining valence electrons, as pairs, around each of the outer atoms, so that they all are surrounded by ''eight electrons.''

Place any remaining electrons on the ''central atom.''

If the central atom is ''not'' surrounded by an octet of electrons, construct ''multiple bonds'' with the outer atoms until ''all'' atoms have a complete octet.

If there are an ''odd number'' of valence electrons in the molecule, leave the remaining single electron on the ''central atom.''

Let’s apply these rules for the Lewis diagram for chlorine gas, Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. There are 14 valence electrons in the molecule. Both atoms are the same, so we draw them next to each other and place two electrons between them to form the covalent bond. Of the twelve remain electrons, we now place six around one chlorine (to give an octet) and then place the other six around the other chlorine (our ''central atom''). Checking, we see that each atom is surrounded by an octet of valence electrons, and so our structure is complete [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/3.3.html Figure 3.3]

All of the Group 7A elements (the halogens), have valence shells with seven electrons and all of the common halogens exist in nature as diatomic molecules; fluorine, F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;; chlorine, Cl&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;; bromine, Br&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and iodine I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (astatine, the halogen in the sixth period, is a short-lived radioactive element and its chemical properties are poorly understood). Nitrogen and oxygen, Group 5A and 6A elements, respectively, also exists in nature as diatomic molecules (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Let’s consider '''oxygen'''&lt;nowiki&gt;; oxygen has six valence electrons (a Group 6A element). Following the logic that we used for chlorine, we draw the two atoms and place one pair of electrons between them, leaving 10 valence electrons. We place three pairs on one oxygen atom, and the remaining two pairs on the second (our &lt;/nowiki&gt;''central atom''). Because we only have six valence electrons surrounding the second oxygen atom, we must move one pair from the other oxygen and form a second covalent bond (a '''double bond''') between the two atoms. Doing this, each atom now has an octet of valence electrons. [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/3.4.html Figure 3.4]

Nitrogen has five valence electrons. Sharing one on each atom gives the first intermediate where each nitrogen is surrounded by six electrons (not enough!). Sharing another pair, each nitrogen is surrounded by seven electrons, and finally, sharing the third, we get a structure where each nitrogen is surrounded by eight electrons; a noble gas configuration (or the “octet rule”). Nitrogen is a very stable molecule and relatively unreactive, being held together by a strong '''triple covalent bond'''. [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/3.5.html Figure 3.5]

As we have constructed Lewis diagrams, thus far, we have strived to achieve an octet of electrons around every element. In nature, however, there are many exceptions to the “octet rule”. Elements in the first row of the periodic table (hydrogen and helium) can only accommodate ''two'' valence electrons. Elements below the second row in the periodic table can accommodate, 10, 12 or even 14 valence electrons (we will see an example of this in the next section). Finally, in many cases molecules exist with single unpaired electrons. A classic example of this is oxygen gas (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). We have previously drawn the Lewis diagram for oxygen with an oxygen-oxygen double bond. Physical measurements on oxygen, however, suggest that this picture of bonding is not quite accurate. The magnetic properties of oxygen, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are most consistent with a structure having ''two unpaired'' electrons in the configuration shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/3.6.html Figure 3.6].

In this Lewis diagram, each oxygen atom is surrounded by ''seven'' electrons (not eight). This electronic configuration may explain why oxygen is such a ''reactive'' molecule (reacting with iron, for example, to form rust); the unpaired electrons on the oxygen molecule are readily available to interact with electrons on other elements to form new chemical compounds.

Another notable exception to the “octet rule” is the molecule NO (nitrogen monoxide). Combining one nitrogen (Group 5A) with one oxygen (Group 6A) gives a molecule with ''eleven'' valence electrons. There is ''no way'' to arrange eleven electrons without leaving one electron unpaired. Nitric oxide is an extremely reactive molecule (by virtue of its unshared electron) and has been found to play a central role is biochemistry as a reactive, short-lived molecule involved in cellular communication.[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/3.7.html Figure 3.7]

As useful as Lewis diagrams can be, chemists tire of drawing little dots and, for a shorthand representation of a covalent bond, a short line (a '''line-bond''') is often drawn between the two elements. Whenever you see atoms connected by a line-bond, you are expected to understand that this represents two shared electrons in a covalent bond. Further, the ''unshared pairs'' of electrons on the bonded atoms are sometimes shown, and sometimes they are omitted (see Figure 3.8). If unshared pairs ore omitted, the chemist reading the structure is assumed to understand that they are present.[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/3.8.html Figure 3.8]

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''3.3 Lewis Representation of Ionic Compounds'''==

As mentioned in Section 3.1, elements can also ''transfer'' electrons to another element in order to achieve the noble gas configuration. Consider sodium. Sodium (Na) is in Group 3A. Its first energy level is completely filled (1''s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' ), the second energy level is also filled (2''s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' 2''p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'') and there is a single electron in the third energy level (3''s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''). Energetically, the easiest way for sodium to achieve an octet of valence electrons is by ''transferring'' its valence electron to an acceptor atom. This will leave the sodium atom with the same electron configuration as neon (1''s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''2''s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' 2''p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;''), and will satisfy the “octet rule”. Because sodium ''loses'' one electron (with its negative charge) the sodium atom must now have a positive charge. Atoms, or covalently bound groups of atoms with a positive charge are called '''cations''', and the sodium cation is written as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/3.9.html Figure 3.9]

If the acceptor atom in the example above was chlorine, the third valence shell would now be filled, matching the electron configuration of argon. Because the chlorine atom has ''accepted'' an electron, with its negative charge, the chlorine atom must now have a negative charge. Atoms, or covalently bound groups of atoms with a negative charge are called '''anions''', and the chlorine anion is written as Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. Although electron transfer has occurred between the two atoms in this example, there is ''no direct bond'' holding the sodium cation and the chlorine anion together, other than the simple electrostatic attraction between the two charged atoms. This is the real difference between ionic and covalently bound atoms; covalent molecules are held together in a ''specific geometry'' which is dictated by the electrons that they share. Ionic compounds are held together by simple electrostatic attraction and, unless these atoms are present in organized crystals, there is no defined geometric order to this attraction. Ionic compounds are often referred to as '''salts'''. Some simple examples of ionization to form ionic salts are shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/3.10.html Figure 3.10]. Line-bond shorthand is used in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Table3.1.html Table 3.1] to show a series of common hydrogen-containing compounds and ions formed from second-row elements.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''3.4 Identifying Molecular and Ionic Compounds'''==

The tendency for two or more elements to combine and form a molecule that is stabilized by covalent bonds (a molecular compound) can be predicted simply by the location of the various elements on the periodic table. In Chapter 1, we divided the elements in the periodic table into (seemingly) arbitrary groupings; the metals, the non-metals, the semi-metals, and so on (See [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/3.11.html Figure 3.11)]. These groupings are not arbitrary, but are largely based on physical properties and on the tendency of the various elements to bond with other elements by forming either an ionic or a covalent bond. As a general rule of thumb, compounds that involve a metal binding with either a non-metal or a semi-metal will display ionic bonding. Compounds that are composed of only non-metals or semi-metals with non-metals will display covalent bonding and will be classified as molecular compounds. Thus, the compound formed from sodium and chlorine will be ionic (a metal and a non-metal). Nitrogen monoxide (NO) will be a covalently bound molecule (two non-metals), silicon dioxide (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) will be a covalently bound molecule (a semi-metal and a non-metal) and MgCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be ionic (a metal and a non-metal). Later in this chapter we will see that many covalent compounds have bonds that are highly '''polarized''' with greater electron density around one atom than the other. These compounds are often described as having “ionic character” and these types of covalent bonds can often be readily broken to form sets of ions.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''3.5 Polyatomic Ions'''==

The compound NaOH has wide industrial use and is the active ingredient in drain cleaners. Based on the discussion in the previous section, we would expect NaOH to be an ionic compound because it contains sodium, a Group 1A metal. Hydrogen and oxygen, however, are nonmetals, and we would expect these to bond together covalently. This compound, called sodium hydroxide, is an example of an ionic compound formed between a metal ion (sodium) and a ''polyatomic ion'' (HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;). Charged groups of atoms, like HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;, that are bonded together covalently are called '''polyatomic ions'''. Within an ionic compound a polyatomic behaves as a single unit forming salts with other cations or anions.

Using the rules described in Section 3.2, we can draw a Lewis diagram for HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;. Oxygen has six valence electrons and hydrogen has one, for a total of seven. The central atom in our structure will be hydrogen (it is to the ''left'' of oxygen in the periodic table). Next, because this is a polyatomic ion with a single negative charge, we add the extra electron to the central atom, pair the electrons and then draw the two atoms bonded together. Next, the six remaining electrons are distributed around the oxygen to form an octet. Finally, the polyatomic ion is enclosed in brackets with the charge as a superscript to show that the ion behaves as a single unit.

Polyatomic ions are very common in chemistry and formulas and charges for common polyatomic ions are collected in Table 3.2. It is ''essential'' that you memorize these and be able to correlate the name, the composition and the charge for each of them, as they will be discussed freely throughout the remainder of the course and you will be expected to know these in General Chemistry.

'''Example 3.4 Lewis Diagrams for Polyatomic Ions'''

Construct a Lewis diagram for the polyatomic ion CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Solution:''' Oxygen has six valence electrons and carbon has four; therefore in CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt; there will be a total of 22 valence electrons, plus two additional electrons from the 2- charge. The central atom in our structure will be carbon (it is to the ''left'' of oxygen in the periodic table). Next, we draw the carbon (our central atom) with its’ four electrons and add the additional two electrons from the charge. The three oxygens are placed around the carbon and the electrons are arranged to form the three covalent bonds. Next, the 18 remaining electrons are distributed around the oxygens so that they all have a full octet. The carbon, however, is only surrounded by six electrons. To remedy this, we move one electron pair in to form a double bond to one of the oxygen atoms. Finally, the polyatomic ion is enclosed in brackets with the charge as a superscript.

The structure for this ion can also be drawn using line-bond shorthand, as shown below:

We need to understand that the process of placing electrons into a particular bond in a compound is an ''artificial'' aspect of building Lewis diagrams. In fact, the electrons are added to the polyatomic ion, but it is ''impossible'' to know exactly where they went.

'''Exercise 3.4 Drawing Lewis Diagrams for Polyatomic Ions.'''

Draw Lewis diagrams for NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''3.6 Resonance'''==

In Example 3.3, we constructed a Lewis diagram for the carbonate anion. Our final structure showed two carbon-oxygen single bonds and one carbon-oxygen double bond. The structure that we drew is shown below, along with two other possible representations for the carbonate anion. These structures differ only in the position of the carbon-oxygen double bond.

So which of these is correct? Actually, they ''all'' are! These are all “proper” Lewis diagrams for a covalent structure having constant geometry, and the diagrams differ ''only'' in the manner that we have arbitrarily arranged the electrons. These Lewis diagrams are called '''resonance forms'''. For the carbonate anion, there are three equivalent resonance forms that can be drawn. It is important to note that the electrons are not “hopping” between the atoms, but that the electrons are spread ''evenly'' between the carbon and all three oxygens and that each carbon-oxygen bond has a bond-order of 1.33 (one and one-third covalent bonds). A structure such as this is called the '''resonance hybrid''' (Figure 3.14), and although it most clearly represents the actual bonding in the compound, it is often difficult to understand the nature of the bonding when structures are represented as resonance hybrids. A full discussion of resonance is beyond the scope of an introductory text and, for structures such as the carbonate anion, we will accept any of the proper resonance forms shown above.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''3.7 Electronegativity and the Polar Covalent Bond'''==

If we were to construct a Lewis diagram for molecular hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), we would pair the single valence electrons on each atom to make a single covalent bond. Each hydrogen would now have two electrons in its valence shell, identical to helium. The mathematical equations chemists use to describe covalent bonding can be solved to predict the regions of space surrounding the molecule in which these electrons are likely to be found. A particularly useful application of these calculations generates a '''molecular surface''' that is color coded to show ''electron density'' surrounding the molecule. This type of molecular surface is called an '''electrostatic potential map''', and the calculated map for the hydrogen molecule is shown in Figure 3.15.

When this type of calculation is done for molecules consisting of two (or more) ''different'' atoms, the results can be strikingly different. Consider the molecule HF. Hydrogen, with one valance electron, can share that electron with fluorine (with seven valence electrons) to form a single covalent bond. A ball-and-stick model of HF is shown in Figure 3.16, along with the electrostatic potential map for the HF molecule.

In this electrostatic potential map, blue is used to indicate low electron density (a relative ''positive'' charge) and red indicates high electron density (a relative ''negative'' charge); the colors light blue, green, yellow and orange indicate the increasing charge gradient. The molecule HF is clearly very '''polar''', meaning that a significant difference in electron density exists across the length of the molecule. The electrostatic potential map for HF contrasts significantly with that for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where the charge was quite symmetrical (a uniform green color). Hydrogen fluoride (HF) can be described as a very ''polar'' molecule, while hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is ''nonpolar''.

The origin of the polarization of the HF covalent bond has to do with ''electronegativity'', an inherent property of all atoms. Within the periodic table, there is a trend for atoms to attract electrons towards themselves when they are bonded to another atom (as in HF). Atoms that tend to strongly attract electrons have a high electronegativity, relative to atoms that have a relatively low tendency to attract electrons towards themselves. The modern electronegativity scale was devised by Linus Pauling in 1932 and, in the Pauling scale, atoms in the periodic table vary in electronegativity from a low of 0.8 for cesium to a maximum of 4.0 for fluorine. A periodic table, modified to show electronegativity trends is shown in Figure 3.17.

'''Figure 3.17''' A periodic table, modified to show the trend in electronegativity, increasing from francium (0.7) to fluorine (4.0).

In the molecule HF, the electronegativity of the hydrogen is 2.2 and fluorine is 4.0. This difference leads to the profound polarization of the HF covalent bond which is apparent in the electrostatic potential map.

Polarizations of covalent bonds also occur in more complex molecules. In water, the oxygen has an electronegativity of 3.5; hydrogen is 2.2. Because of this, each of the H-O bonds is polarized with greater electron density towards the oxygen. Within the molecule, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, the effect of this polarization becomes apparent in the electrostatic potential map, as shown in Figure 3.18. The end of the molecule with the oxygen has a high electron density and the hydrogen ends are electron deficient. We will see in later chapters that the polarization of water, caused by the difference in electronegativities, gives water the special properties that allows it to dissolve ionic compounds, and basically support life as we know it. Within organic chemistry (the study of carbon-containing molecular compounds), you will appreciate that the relative reactivity of organic molecules with each other is largely dependent on the polarization of covalent bonds in these molecules.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''3.8 Exceptions to the Octet Rule'''==

Returning briefly to classical Lewis diagrams. Consider the diagram shown below for the molecule SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. In constructing this diagram, six valence electrons are placed around the sulfur and seven valence electrons are placed around each fluorine. As we attempt to pair these to form covalent bonds, we note that there are “too many” electrons on the sulfur! We clearly cannot form a covalent bond using three electrons, so we ''split'' one pair, move the single electrons into bonding position and form bonds with the remaining two fluorines. The “extra pair” of electrons just ''sits there'' on the sulfur and does not participate directly in the bonding.

This is an example of '''valence expansion'''. In general, elements ''below'' the second period in the periodic table (S, Se, Te, etc.) will commonly have 10 – 12 electrons in their valence shells. As in SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, these electrons are not directly involved in the formation of covalent bonds, but they affect the overall reactivity of the particular molecule.

Examples of compounds that exhibit valence expansion from Groups 4A – 8 are shown in Table 3.3. In general, all molecular compounds containing elements that appear below the second row in the periodic table are capable of valence expansion and you need to be very careful when you are drawing Lewis diagrams for these compounds. As we saw in Section 3.1 for the molecule nitrogen oxide (NO), stable molecules also exist in which atoms are ''not'' surrounded by an octet of electrons. Another example of this is the molecule BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is shown in the following example.

'''Example 3.5 Lewis Diagrams for BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''

Construct a Lewis diagram for the molecule BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Solution:''' Boron has three valence electrons and fluorine has seven. The central atom in our structure will be boron (it is to the ''left'' of fluorine in the periodic table). Next, we draw the boron (our central atom) with its’ three electrons and place the three fluorines around the boron with the electrons arranged to form the three covalent bonds. Each of the fluorines have a full octet. The boron, however, is only surrounded by six electrons. Because of this, the boron in BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a powerful ''electron acceptor'' and forms strong complexes with electrons from other compounds. In Chapter 8 we will see that this property is called Lewis acidity and BF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a very powerful Lewis acid.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''3.9 Common Valence States and Ionic Compounds'''==

In an ionic compound the total number of charges on the cations must equal the total number of charges on the anions; that is, the compound must be ''neutral''. In Section 3.2 we described how a sodium atom can donate an electron to another atom in order to form an ion with a full octet of electrons in its outermost electron shell (the same electron configuration as Ne). The charge on the sodium atom, when this happens, is now 1+, because it has eleven protons in its nucleus, but is only surrounded by 10 electrons. Lithium, likewise, can lose one electron to form Li&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt; and be left with the same electron configuration as He. In fact, all of the Group 1A metals can lose a single electron to form 1+ ions. Elements in Group 2A can each lose ''two'' electrons to form 2+ ions and achieve a noble gas configuration. In fact, the group that a main-group element is associated with in the periodic table will dictate the valence (or charge) of its corresponding ion. Metals in Groups 1A, 2A and 3A will form ions with 1+, 2+ and 3+ charges, respectively.

Main-group nonmetals can easily achieve an octet of valence electrons by accepting electrons from other elements. Thus Group 5A elements can accept three electrons to form 3- ions, Group 6A elements accept two electrons to form 2- ions and Group 7A elements (the halogens) accept one electron to form 1- ions. For example, oxygen (Group 6A) needs to accept two electrons to achieve the electron configuration of neon. This gives oxygen a total of 10 electrons, but it only has eight protons in its nucleus (its atomic number is 8), therefore, the oxygen ion has a net charge of 2- (O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;).

To write a formula for an ionic compound composed of main group elements (or containing polyatomic ions) you need to adjust the ratio of anions and cations so that the resulting molecule is electrically neutral. For example, consider an ionic compound containing sodium and chlorine. Lithium is a Group 1A element and will form a 1+ ion; fluorine is a Group 7A element and will form a 1- ion. Neutrality is achieved when one lithium is paired with one fluorine, or LiF. For a compound composed of calcium and chlorine, the Group 2A calcium will form a 2+ ion while chlorine forms a 1- ion. To achieve neutrality, there must be ''two'' chlorines for every calcium, and the formula must be as CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Aluminum (Group 3A) will form a 3+ ion. If this was paired with oxygen (Group 6A) which forms a 2- ion neutrality would only be achieved if ''two'' Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions (for a total of six positive charges) were paired with ''three'' O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; ions (a total of six negative charges).

Consider a compound consisting of sodium and the polyatomic ion sulfate (SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;). Sodium (Group 1A) yields a 1+ cation and so there must be ''two'' sodiums in the compound for every sulfate (which has a 2- charge), or Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. For a compound containing calcium (Group 2A) and nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), ''two'' nitrate anions must be present for every calcium 2+ cation. In a compound containing multiple copies of a polyatomic ion, the entire ion is enclosed in parenthesis with a subscript to indicate the number of units. Thus the compound from calcium and nitrate would be written as Ca(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''3.10 Nomenclature of Ionic Compounds'''==

The simplest ionic compounds consist of a single type of cation associated with a single type of anion. Nomenclature for these compounds is trivial; the cation is named first, followed by the anion. If the anion is a single element, the suffix ''ide'' is added to the root name of the element. A set of common anions from Figure 3.19 is shown in Table 3.4.

When you are constructing names for ionic compounds, you do not use “multipliers” to indicate how many cations or anions are present in the compound. For example NaI is named ''sodium iodide;'' Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is named ''sodium sulfide;'' CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is named ''calcium chloride.'' The chemist reading the name is assumed to have sufficient knowledge to pair the elements properly based on their common valence states. There are exceptions to this simple nomenclature, however. Many transition metals exist as more than one type of cation. Thus, iron exists as Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; cations (they are referred to as “oxidation states”, and will be covered in detail in Chapter 5). When you are naming an ionic compound containing iron, it is necessary to indicate which oxidation state the metal has. For metals, the oxidation state is the same as the charge. Thus Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in a compound with chloride would have a formula FeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and would be named iron (II) chloride, with the oxidation state (the charge on the iron) appearing as a Roman numeral in parenthesis after the cation. The cation Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; paired with oxygen would have the formula Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and would have the name iron (III) oxide. Some common transition metals with variable oxidation states are shown in Table 3.5.

The procedure for naming ionic compounds contain polyatomic ions is identical to that described above for simple ions. Thus, CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is named ''calcium carbonate;'' Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is named ''sodium sulfate;'' (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (a compound with two polyatomic ions) is named ''ammonium hydrogen phosphate;'' and Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; paired with SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;, PbSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is named ''lead (II) sulfate.''

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''3.11 Nomenclature of Molecular Compounds'''==

The nomenclature of simple binary molecular compounds (covalently bonded compounds consisting of only two elements) is slightly more complicated than the nomenclature of ionic compounds because ''multipliers'' must be used to indicate the ratio of the elements in the molecule; the multiplier ''mono'' is only used for the second element in a compound. The multipliers that are used are shown in Table 3.6.

Further, when you are naming a molecular compound, you must also decide which element should be listed first. In general, elements appearing to the ''left'' or ''lower'' in the periodic table are listed first in the name. Once you have decided on the order, the second element is named using the element root and ''ide'', just like in ionic compounds. Thus, for CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, carbon is to the ''left'' of chlorine (Group 4A ''vs.'' Group 5A), so it is listed first. There are four chlorines, so the multiplier ''tetra'' is used, and the name is '''carbon tetrachloride'''. Compounds containing hydrogen are generally an exception, and the hydrogen is listed as the first element in the name. Thus, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S would be named using the multiplier ''di'' to indicate that there are two hydrogens and ''mono'' to indicate that there is only one sulfur, or, dihydrogen monosulfide.

For the molecule SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;; they are both Group 6A elements, but sulfur is &lt;/nowiki&gt;''lower'' in the periodic table (Row 3 ''vs.'' Row 2) so it is ''first'' in the name. There are two oxygens, so the multiplier is ''di'' and the name is '''sulfur dioxide'''.

For the molecule NO; nitrogen is to the ''left'' of oxygen (Group 6A ''vs.'' Group 5A) so it is ''first'' in the name. There is one oxygen, so the multiplier is ''mono'' and, following the rules, the name would be “nitrogen mon'''oo'''xide”. In this case, however, the second “o” in the name is ''dropped'' (to allow for easier pronunciation ) and the name is shortened to '''nitrogen monoxide'''. Distinguish this from another oxide of nitrogen, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Again nitrogen is first and needs the multiplier ''di''. There are four oxygens, so the multiplier is ''tetra,'' but once again the multiplier is shortened (again, the “a” is dropped) and the name is '''dinitrogen tetroxide'''.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''''Study Points'''''==

In '''covalent bonding''', electrons are ''shared'' between atoms. In '''ionic bonding''', electrons are transferred from one atom to another. Compounds that are formed using only covalent bonds are termed '''molecular compounds'''.

The ''outermost'' electron level in any atom is referred to as the '''valence shell'''. The electron configuration of the valence shell of an atom can be shown graphically using a '''Lewis diagram''' (or ''electron-dot structure''). The arrangement of “dots” around the chemical symbol for the element are shown singly up through four electrons, and then paired until eight electrons are present.

To form ions from individual elements, electrons are added or subtracted from the valence shell in order to completely fill the shell with eight electrons (the '''octet rule'''). The charge on the ion reflects the electrons added or removed. Representative elements through Group IIIA will lose electrons to form cations, while those in groups IVA – VIIA will gain electrons and form anions.

A '''covalent bond''' is constructed in a Lewis diagram by pairing a set of unpaired electrons from two different atoms. For the purposes of the “octet rule”, a pair of shared electrons is counted as two electrons for each atom. Multiple covalent bonds ('''double bonds''' and '''triple bonds''') are used, if necessary, to give each bonded atom a full octet (except, of course, for helium and hydrogen). When two or more atoms are bonded together utilizing covalent bonds, the compound is referred to as a '''molecule'''.

As a rule of thumb, '''ionic''' bonds will be formed whenever the compound contains a '''metal'''. '''Covalent''' bonding will be observed in compounds containing only '''semimetals''' or '''nonmetals'''.

Groups of covalently bonded semimetals or nonmetals which are charged are called '''polyatomic ions'''. Common examples include sulfate dianion, nitrate anion, phosphate trianion, etc. These polyatomic ions are commonly paired with metals forming ionic compounds.

Many (but not all) polyatomic ions can be drawn in two or more equivalent Lewis representations. These are called '''resonance forms''' of the ion. The actual electronic structure of the ion is a combination of these Lewis structures and is called the '''resonance hybrid'''.

The '''electronegativity''' of an element is a measure of the tendency of that element to attract electrons towards itself. Electronegativities range from 0.6 to 4.0, with fluorine as the most electronegative element (a value of 4.0). The general trend in the periodic table is for electronegativity to increase from the lower left-hand corner (Fr) to the upper right-hand corner (F).

Covalent bonds formed between atoms with different electronegativity will be '''polarized''' with the greatest electron density localized around the most electronegative atom. The effect of electronegativity on electron distribution within a molecule can be shown using a computer-calculated '''electrostatic potential map''' where colors are used to represent electron density.

Elements in periods 3 – 7 can accommodate more that eight electrons in there valence shells. This phenomena is called '''valence shell expansion''' and molecules involving these elements may have 10 – 14 valence electrons in properly drawn Lewis diagrams. Exceptions to the “octet rule” also exist where the valence shell contains less than eight electrons, or contains unpaired electrons.

When naming simple, binary '''ionic''' compounds, the cation is named first using the name of the element, followed by the anion, where the suffix ''ide'' is added to the root name of the element. Multipliers are '''not used'''. For transition metals in which the metal can assume a variety of oxidation states (different positive charges), the charge of the metal ion is shown in the name using Roman numerals, in parenthesis, following the name of the element (i.e., iron (III) chloride).

When naming simple binary '''molecular''' compounds (compounds containing only covalent bonds) the ''least electronegative'' element is (generally) named first, followed by the second element, where the suffix ''ide'' is again added to the root name of the element. In molecular compounds multipliers are used to indicate the number of each atom present (mono-, di-, tri-, tetra-, etc.) with the exception that ''mono'' is not used for the first element in the compound.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;big&gt;'''Chapter 4.  The Mole and Measurement in Chemistry'''&lt;/big&gt;==

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;4.1  Measurement and Scale in Chemistry:  The Mole Concept ==

One of the important concepts to grasp in chemistry is ''scale.''  Atoms and molecules are very small.  A single atom of hydrogen has a mass of about 1.67  x  10&lt;sup&gt;-24&lt;/sup&gt; grams (that’s 0.00000000000000000000000167 grams). One cubic centimeter of water (one mL) contains about 3.3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; water molecules (that’s 33 sextillion molecules).  Because chemists routinely use numbers that are both incredibly small and incredibly large, unique units of measurement have been developed to simplify working with these numbers. As we learned in Chapter 1, the atomic mass unit (amu) helps us talk about the mass of atoms on a scale appropriate to atoms (one grams is about 600 sextillion amu).  In this chapter, we will introduce the concept of a mole to help us talk about numbers of atoms on a scale appropriate to the size of a sample we could work with in a laboratory (for example, in grams).  The '''mole''' is defined as the number of atoms contained in ''exactly'' 12 grams of carbon-12 (the isotope &lt;math&gt;{}_{6}^{12}\text{C}&lt;/math&gt;).  Chemist have measured this number and it turns out to be 6.0221415 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;. We can think of the term ''mole'' as a number, just like the word ''dozen'' represents the number 12.  We will use the mole  to represent this very large number (a ''chemist’s dozen'') and we will see that there is a special relationship between a mole of a pure substance and the mass of the substance measured in amu. [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/4.1.html Figure 4.1]

The origin of the mole concept is generally attributed to the Italian chemical physicist, Amadeo Avogadro [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/4.2.html Figure 4.2].  In 1811, Avogadro published an important article that drew a distinction between atoms and molecules (although these terms were not in use at the time).   As part of his explanation of the behavior of gasses, he suggested ''that equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pressure contained the same number of molecules.''  This statement is referred to as '''Avogadro’s Hypothesis''' and today we commonly refer to the number of ''things'' in a mole, (6.0221415  x  10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;) as '''Avogadro’s number''' (this is rounded to 6.02 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; for most calculations).  Because a mole can be thought of as a ''number'', you can convert any number to moles by dividing that number by 6.02 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;.  For example, at the time of this writing, the national debt of the United States is about 7.9 trillion dollars (7.9  x  10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; dollars).  This could be expressed as ''moles of dollars'' as shown below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\left( 7.9\times 10^{12}dollars \right)\left( \frac{1\text{ }mol\text{ }dollars}{6.02\times 10^{23}dollars} \right)=mol\text{ }dollars&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=1.3\times 10^{-11}mol\text{ }dollars&lt;/math&gt;


The ratio of any number to the number of things in a mole is often referred to as a '''mole fraction'''.


'''&lt;big&gt;[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex4.1.html Exercise 4.1]  Numbers of Things in Multiple Moles and in Mole Fractions.&lt;/big&gt;'''

  a. It is estimated there are 7 x 10&lt;sup&gt;22&lt;/sup&gt; stars in the universe.  How many moles of stars is this?

  b. It is estimated there are 7.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; grains of sand on the earth.  How many moles of sand grains is this?

  c. You have 0.0555 moles of jelly donuts. What number of donuts would that be?

  d. You drink a small bottle of drinking water that contains 13 moles of water.&lt;br&gt;    What is the number of molecules of water you drank?


== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;4.2  Molar Mass ==

As we described in Section 4.1, in chemistry, the term '''mole''' can be used to describe a particular number.  The number of things in a mole is large,  ''very'' large (6.0221415  x  10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;).  We are all familiar with common copy-machine paper that comes in 500 sheet reams.  If you stacked up 6.02  x  10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; sheets of this paper, the pile would reach from the earth to the moon '''80 billion times'''&lt;nowiki&gt;!  The mole is a &lt;/nowiki&gt;''huge'' number, and by appreciating this, you can also gain an understanding of how ''small'' molecules and atoms really are.  [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/4.3.html Figure 4.3]

Chemists work simultaneously on the level of individual atoms, and on the level of samples large enough to work with in the laboratory.  In order to go back and forth between these two scales, they often need to know how many atoms or molecules there are in the sample they’re working with.  The concept that allows us to bridge these two scales is '''molar mass'''.  Molar mass is defined '''as the mass in grams of one mole of a substance'''.  The units of molar mass are grams ''per'' mole, abbreviated as &lt;math&gt;\left( {}^{g}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{mol}\; \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The mass of a single isotope of any given element (the '''isotopic atomic mass''') is a value relating the mass of that isotope to the mass of the isotope carbon-12 (&lt;math&gt;{}_{6}^{12}\text{C}&lt;/math&gt;);  a carbon atom with six proton and six neutrons in its’ nucleus, surrounded by six electrons.  The '''atomic mass''' of an element is the relative average of ''all'' of the naturally occurring isotopes of that element and atomic mass is the number that appears in the periodic table.  We have defined a mole based on the isotopic atomic mass of carbon-12.  By definition, the ''molar mass'' of carbon-12 is numerically the same, and is therefore ''exactly'' 12 grams.  Generalizing this definition, '''the molar mass of any substance in grams ''per'' mole is numerically equal to the mass of that substance expressed in atomic mass units'''.  For example, the ''atomic mass'' of an oxygen atom is 16.00 amu;  that means the ''molar mass'' of an oxygen atom is 16.00 g/mol.  Further, if you have 16.00 grams of oxygen atoms, you know from the definition of a mole that your sample contains 6.022  x  10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen atoms.

The concept of molar mass can also be applied to compounds.  For a molecule (for example, nitrogen, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) the mass of molecule is the sum of the atomic masses of the two nitrogen atoms.  For nitrogen, the mass of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule is simply (14.01 + 14.01) = 28.02 amu.  This is referred to as the '''molecular mass''' and the molecular mass of any molecule is simply the sum of the atomic masses of all of the elements in that molecule.  The molar mass of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule is therefore 28.02 g/mol. For compounds that are ''not molecular'' (ionic compounds), it is improper to use the term “molecular mass” and “'''formula mass'''” is generally substituted.  This is because there are no individual molecules in ionic compounds. However  when talking about a mole of an ionic compound we will still use the term molar mass. Thus, the ''formula'' mass of calcium hydrogen carbonate is 117.10 amu and the ''molar'' mass of calcium hydrogen carbonate is 117.10 grams per mole (g/mol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


'''&lt;big&gt;[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp4.1.html Example 4.1]  Calculation of Molecular and Masses&lt;/big&gt;'''

    Calculate the molecular mass for the sugar glucose (C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;).


'''&lt;big&gt;[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex4.2.html Exercise 4.2]:  Calculation of Molar Masses.&lt;/big&gt;'''

  '''Find the molar mass of each of the following compounds:'''&lt;p&gt;
    Sand, silicon dioxide (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
    Draino™, sodium hydroxide (NaOH)
    Nutrasweet™, Aspartame (C&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)
    Bone phosphate, calcium phosphate Ca&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;4.3  Mole-Mass Conversions ==

As described in the previous section, molar mass is expressed as “grams ''per'' mole”.  The word ''per'' in this context implies a mathematical relationship between grams and mole.  Think of this as a ratio. The fact that a ''per'' relationship, ratio, exists between grams and moles implies that you can use dimensional analysis to interconvert between the two.  For example, if we wanted to know the mass of 0.50 mole of molecular hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) we could set up the following equations:

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Eq4.1.html Equation] The '''''known''''' molar mass of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is  &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{2.\text{016 }g\text{ H}_{\text{2}}}{1\text{ }mol\text{ H}_{\text{2}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We are '''''given''''' that we have 0.50 moles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and we want to '''''find''''' the number of grams of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that this represents.  To perform the dimensional analysis, we arrange the ''known'' and the ''given'' so that the units cancel, leaving only the units of the item we want to ''find''.

&lt;math&gt;\left( 0.50\text{ }mol\text{ H}_{\text{2}} \right)\times \left( \frac{2.\text{016 }g\text{ H}_{\text{2}}}{1\text{ }mol\text{ H}_{\text{2}}} \right)=x\text{ }g\text{ H}_{\text{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt;=\text{1}\text{.0 }g\text{ H}_{\text{2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


'''&lt;big&gt;[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp4.2.html Example 4.2]  Mole-to-Mass and Mass-to-Mole Conversions&lt;/big&gt;'''

  a.  Determine the mass of 0.752 mol of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas.

  b.  How many ''moles'' of molecular hydrogen are present in 6.022 grams of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;?

  c.  If you have 22.414 grams of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, how many ''moles'' of molecular chlorine do you have?


We can also use what is often called a ''per'' relationship (really just a '''ratio''') to convert between number of ''moles'' and the number to ''things'' (as in 6.02  x  10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; ''things per mole'').  For example, if we wanted to know how many ''molecules'' of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are there in 3.42 moles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas we could set up the following equations:

The '''''known''''' ratio of molecules ''per'' mole is &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{6.\text{02 }\times \text{ 10}^{\text{23}}\text{ }molecules\text{ H}_{\text{2}}}{1\text{ }mol\text{ H}_{\text{2}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Eq4.2.html Equation ]We are '''''given''''' that we have 3.42 moles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and we want to '''''find''''' the number of molecules of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that this represents.  To perform the dimensional analysis, we arrange the ''known'' and the ''given'' so that the units cancel, leaving only the units of the item we want to ''find''.

&lt;math&gt;\left( 3.\text{42 }mol\text{ H}_{\text{2}} \right)\times \left( \frac{6.\text{02 }\times \text{ 10}^{\text{23}}\text{ }molecules\text{ H}_{\text{2}}}{1\text{ }mol\text{ H}_{\text{2}}} \right)=x\text{ }molecules\text{ H}_{\text{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=\text{2}.06\times \text{10}^{\text{24}}molecules\text{ H}_{\text{2}}&lt;/math&gt;



And finally, we can combine these two operations and use the ''per'' relationships to convert between ''mass'' and the ''number'' of atoms or molecules.  For example, if we wanted to know how many ''molecules'' of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are there in 6.022 ''grams'' of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas we could set up the following series of equations:

The '''''known''''' molar mass of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is  &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{2.\text{016 }g\text{ H}_{\text{2}}}{1\text{ }mol\text{ H}_{\text{2}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The '''''known''''' ratio of molecules ''per'' mole is  &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{6.\text{02 }\times \text{ 10}^{\text{23}}\text{ }molecules\text{ H}_{\text{2}}}{1\text{ }mol\text{ H}_{\text{2}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Eq4.3.html Equation ]We are '''''given''''' that we have 6.022 grams of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and we want to '''''find''''' the number of molecules of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that this represents.  As always, to perform the dimensional analysis, we arrange the ''known'' ratios and the ''given'' so that the units cancel, leaving only the units of the item we want to ''find''.


&lt;math&gt;\left( 6.\text{022 }g\text{ H}_{\text{2}} \right)\times \left( \frac{1\text{ }mol\text{ H}_{\text{2}}}{2.\text{016 }g\text{ H}_{\text{2}}} \right)\times \left( \frac{6.\text{02 }\times \text{ 10}^{\text{23}}\text{ }molecules\text{ H}_{\text{2}}}{1\text{ }mol\text{ H}_{\text{2}}} \right)=x\text{ }molecules\text{ H}_{\text{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=\text{1}.80\times \text{10}^{\text{24}}\text{ }molecules\text{ H}_{\text{2}}&lt;/math&gt;


'''&lt;big&gt;[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp4.5.html Example 4.5]  Number-to-Mass Conversion&lt;/big&gt;'''

    A sample of molecular chlorine is found to contain 1.0  x  10&lt;sup&gt;20&lt;/sup&gt; molecules of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;br&gt;    What is the ''mass'' (in grams) of this sample?


'''&lt;big&gt;[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex4.3.html Exercise 4.3]:  Mole, Mass and Number Conversions.&lt;/big&gt;'''


  a. How many moles of sand, silicon dioxide (SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and how many molecules of sand are found in 1.00 pound (454g)&lt;br&gt;    of sand?

  b. You add 2.64 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; molecules of sodium hydroxide (Drano™; NaOH), to your drain.  How many moles are this&lt;br&gt;    and how many grams?[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/4.4.html Figure 4.4]


== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;4.4 Percentage Composition  ==

We are all familiar with the term ''percentage''.  We take an exam that is worth 100 points, we get 96 correct and we describe our score as 96%.  We arrive at 96% by first taking our score and dividing it by the total number of points to get the ''fraction'' that we got correct.  To convert the fraction to a ''percentage'', we multiply the fraction by 100.

&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\text{96 points}}{100\text{ points total}} \right)\times 100=96%&lt;/math&gt;

Applying this concept to molecules, we could describe HCl as consisting of one atom of hydrogen and one atom of chlorine.  Likewise, we could use ''mole'' nomenclature and say that one ''mole'' of the molecule consists of one ''mole'' of hydrogen and one ''mole'' of chlorine, and that one ''mole'' of HCl has a mass of 36.46 grams.  These descriptions, however, tell us nothing about how much of this mass is attributable to the hydrogen and how much comes from the chlorine.  In order to do this, we need to speak of the '''percentage composition''' of a molecule, that is, what percent of the total mass arises from each element.  These calculations are simple and involve taking the atomic mass of the element in question and dividing by the molar mass of the molecule.

For HCl,  the ''fraction'' of hydrogen in HCl is given by the molar mass of hydrogen divided by the molar mass of HCl:

&lt;math&gt;{}^{\left( 1.008\text{ }{}^{\text{g}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{mol}}\; \right)}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\left( \text{36}\text{.46 }{}^{\text{g}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{mol}}\; \right)}&lt;/math&gt;


and the ''percentage'' of hydrogen in HCl is obtained by multiplying the ''fraction'' by 100:

&lt;math&gt;0.02765\times 100=2.765%&lt;/math&gt;

Combining the steps, the ''percentage'' of chlorine in HCl can be calculated by dividing the molar mass of chlorine by the molar mass of HCl and multiplying by 100:

&lt;math&gt;{}^{\left( 1.008\text{ }{}^{\text{g}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{mol}}\; \right)}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\left( \text{36}\text{.46 }{}^{\text{g}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{mol}}\; \right)}\;=0.02765&lt;/math&gt;


'''&lt;big&gt;[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp4.6.html Example 4.6]  The Percentage of an Element in a Compound&lt;/big&gt;'''

    Find the percentage of fluorine in calcium fluoride (CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

These types of problems can also be presented as mass calculations.  For example, determine the mass of calcium in 423.6 grams of CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Collecting our known, given and find values:

The known molar mass of Ca is &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{4\text{0}\text{.08 }g\text{ Ca}}{1\text{ }mol\text{ Ca}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

The known molar mass of CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is  &lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{7\text{8}\text{.08 }g\text{ CaF}_{\text{2}}}{1\text{ }mol\text{ Cl}_{\text{2}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Eq4.4.html Equation ]We are given that we have a sample of CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a mass of 423.6 grams and we want to find the mass of Ca in this sample.  We could find the mass of Ca if we knew the fraction of Ca in CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  We could then multiply this fraction by the known mass of CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to obtain the mass of calcium in the sample.  The fraction of Ca in CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the ratio of the two known molar masses (the percentage, before you multiply by 100).  As  always, to perform the dimensional analysis, we arrange the known and the given so that the units cancel, leaving only the units of the item we want to find. 

&lt;math&gt;\left( 4\text{23}\text{.6 }g\text{ CaF}_{\text{2}} \right)\times \left( \frac{1\text{ }mol\text{ }}{7\text{8}\text{.08 }g\text{ CaF}_{\text{2}}} \right)\times \left( \frac{4\text{0}\text{.08 }g\text{ Ca}}{1\text{ }mol\text{ }} \right)=x\text{ }g\text{ Ca}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;=217.4\text{ }g\text{ Ca}&lt;/math&gt;
	 

	Note that in this example, you want to use the fraction of Ca in CaF2, not the percentage;  if you used percentage, you would have to divide your answer by 100 to get the proper number of grams of Ca in the sample.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;4.5 Empirical and Molecular Formulas  ==

In Chapter 2, we introduced the concept of a chemical compound as a substance that results from the combination of two or more atoms, in such a way that the atoms are bonded together in a constant ratio.  We represented that ratio using the symbols for the atoms in the molecule, with subscripts to indicate the fixed ratios of the various atoms.  The result is a molecular formula, and in Chapter 3, we used molecular formulas to devise chemical names for both molecular and ionic compounds.  As we have seen in this chapter, molecular formulas can be used to directly calculate the molar mass of a compound, as shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/4.5.html Figure 4.5].

Many of the methods, however, that chemists use in the laboratory to determine the composition of compounds do not give the molecular formula of the compound directly, but instead simply yield the ''lowest whole-number ratio'' of the elements in the compound.  A formula such as this is called an '''empirical formula'''.  For example, the molecular formula for glucose is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, but the simplest whole-number ratio of the elements in glucose is CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O;  if you multiply each element in (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) by ''six'', you obtain the molecular formula for glucose.  An empirical formula cannot be converted into a molecular formula unless you know the molar mass of the compound.  For example, the empirical formula for acetic acid (the acidic component in vinegar) is identical to that for glucose (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).  If you analyzed these two compounds and determined only an empirical formula, you could not identify which compound you had.

Conversion of an empirical formula into a molecular formula requires that you know the molar mass of the compound in question.  Knowing this, you can calculate a molecular formula based on the fact that an empirical formula can always be multiplied by an integer ''n'' to yield a molecular formula.  Thus, some value of ''n'', multiplying each element in CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O will yield the molecular formula of acetic acid.  The value of ''n'' can be determined as follows:

''n''  x  (CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ), where &lt;math&gt;n=\frac{\text{molar mass of the compound}}{\text{molar mass of the empirical formula}}&lt;/math&gt;


For acetic acid, the molar mass is 60.05 g/mol, and the molar mass of the empirical formula CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O is 30.02 g/mol.  The value of the integer ''n'' for acetic acid is therefore,


&lt;math&gt;n=\frac{\text{60}\text{.05 }{}^{g}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{mol}\;}{\text{30}\text{.02 }{}^{g}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{mol}\;}=2&lt;/math&gt;;  and the molecular formula is 2  x  (CH&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), or C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

Note that ''n'' must be an integer and that your calculation should always yield a whole number (or very close to one).


'''&lt;big&gt;[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp4.7.html Example 4.7]  Empirical and Molecular Formula Calculations&lt;/big&gt;'''

    A compound is determined to have a molar mass of  58.12 g/mol and an empirical formula of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;;&lt;br&gt;   determine the molecular formula for this compound.

    Benzene is an intermediate in the production of many important chemicals used in the manufacture of plastics,&lt;br&gt;    drugs, dyes, detergents and insecticides. Benzene has an empirical formula of CH.  It has a molar mass of&lt;br&gt;   78.11 g/mol.What is the molecular formula?


== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;  Study Points   ==

*The '''mole''' is defined as the number of atoms contained in ''exactly'' 12 grams of carbon-12 (the isotope ).  There are 6.0221415  x  10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; particles in a mole.  Remember, a ''mole'' is just a number (like ''dozen'') and you can have a mole of ''anything.''&lt;/div&gt;
*The concept of a mole is based on '''Avogadro’s Hypothesis''' (''equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pressure contained the same number of molecules'') and the number of particles in a mole (6.0221415  x  10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;) is commonly referred to as '''Avogadro’s number''' (typically rounded to 6.02 x 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; for most calculations).
*Because atomic masses, and the number of particles in a mole, are both based on the isotopic atomic mass of the isotope carbon-12, '''the''' '''mass of any substance expressed in atomic mass units is numerically equal to the ''molar mass'' of the substance in grams ''per'' mole'''.  Thus, ''exactly'' 12 grams of carbon-12 contains ''exactly'' a mole of carbon atoms;  likewise, 31.9988 grams of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contains 6.02214  x  10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; oxygen molecules (note, ''six'' significant figures), etc.

*To convert the number of '''moles''' of a substance into the '''mass''' of a substance, you simply need to multiply ('''moles'''  x  '''molar mass''').&lt;/div&gt;

*To convert the '''mass''' of a substance into the number of '''moles''', you simply need to ''divide'' the '''mass''' by the '''molar mass'''.
*To convert the number of '''moles''' of a substance into the number of '''particles''' of that substance, you simply need to multiply ('''moles'''  x  '''Avogadro’s number''').

*The '''percentage composition''' of a compound, simply tells us what ''percent'' of the total mass arises from each element in the compound.  To do the calculation, simply take the atomic mass of the element in question and divide it by the molar mass of the molecule.
*The '''empirical formula''' for a compound is the ''lowest whole-number ratio'' of the elements in that compound. For example, the molecular formula for glucose is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, but the simplest whole-number ratio of the elements in glucose is CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;big&gt;'''Chapter 5.  Chemical Reactions'''&lt;/big&gt;==
In Chapter 2, we learned that chemical changes result in the transformation of one chemical substance into a different substance having a new set of chemical and physical properties.  The transformation of one substance into another is called a ''chemical reaction'' and is described using a ''chemical equation''.  In this chapter we will learn how to write and balance simple chemical equations.  We will learn the basic ''types'' of chemical reactions and we will learn how to predict the products that are likely to be formed when these reactions occur.  We will examine a special type of chemical reaction in which one of the products has low solubility in water and ''precipitates'' from solution.  Understanding the basic rules of solubility is simple and again will allow us to predict when this type of reaction is likely to be observed.  Finally, we will address the ''energetics'' of chemical reactions, laying a fundamental background for the study of reaction rates and equilibrium later in the course.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.1  Chemical Changes and Chemical Reactions ==

In Chapter 2, we classified changes in our environment utilizing the concepts of ''physical'' and ''chemical changes.'' We said that a '''physical change''' alters the ''appearance'' of a substance without changing its molecular structure.  Ice melts, water evaporates and mountains are slowly weathered into dust.  All of these change the ''characteristics'' of substances, but they do not alter its basic structure.  A '''chemical change''', however, results in the transformation of one molecular substance into another.  Gasoline burns, reacting with oxygen in the atmosphere, generating light, heat, and converting the carbon-based molecules into carbon dioxide gas and water vapor.  When substances combine like this and undergo chemical changes, we say that a '''chemical reaction''' has occurred.  Some chemical reactions are quite evident, like the burning of gasoline, and involve the production of '''heat''' or '''light'''.  In other types of chemical reactions, '''gases''' are evolved, '''color changes''' occur and clear solutions become cloudy, with the ultimate formation of an insoluble substance (a '''precipitate''').  Chemical changes can also be quite obscure and their occurrence can only be detected by sophisticated chemical analysis.

Sometimes chemical changes occur spontaneously, others require the input of energy (heat) in order to occur.  Chemical reactions can occur rapidly, like the explosive reaction of sodium metal in the presence of water, and others occur very slowly, like the rusting of iron or the tarnish that slowly develops on some metal surfaces exposed to air.  In this chapter we will learn to represent chemical reactions using '''chemical equations'''.  We will learn to '''balance''' these equations, explore '''types''' of reactions and learn to '''predict products''' from simple reactions.   Central to all of this is the concept of the ''chemical equation''.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.2  Chemical Equations ==
The processes that occur during a chemical change can be represented using a '''chemical equation'''.  In a chemical equation, the chemical formulas for the substance or substances that ''undergo'' the chemical reaction (the '''reactants''') and the formulas for the new substance or substances that are formed (the '''products''') are both shown, and are linked by an '''arrow'''.  The arrow in a chemical equation has the properties of an “equals sign” in mathematics, and because of this, '''''in a chemical equation, there must be the same number and types of atoms on each side of the arrow.'''''  

'''Reactants'''  →  '''Products'''

As an example of a chemical reaction, consider the reaction between solid carbon and oxygen gas to form carbon dioxide gas.  This chemical equation for this reaction can be written as shown below. [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/5.1.html Figure 5.1]

C ''(s)''  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' →  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''

In this equation, we have used '''''(s)''''' and '''''(g)''''' to represent the physical state of the reactants at the time of the reaction (solid and gas).  Other abbreviations that are often used include '''''(l)''''' for liquid and '''''(aq)''''' to indicate that the reactant or product is dissolved in aqueous solution.

As we inspect this equation we see that there is one carbon atom on each side of the arrow and that there are two oxygen atoms on each side.  An equation in which there are the same number and types of atoms on both sides of the arrow is referred to as '''balanced'''.  As you write chemical equations, it is important to remember those elements that naturally occur as diatomic molecules (Table 1.1).  Remember that when you include these as reactants or products, remember to indicate that they are diatomic by using the subscript “2”.

'''&lt;big&gt;[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex5.1.html Exercise 5.1]  Writing Chemical Equations.&lt;/big&gt;'''

  a. Write a chemical equation for the reaction of solid iron with solid sulfur to form solid &lt;br&gt;    iron(II) sulfide.

  b. Write a chemical equation for the reaction of solid carbon with solid magnesium oxide to &lt;br&gt;    form carbon monoxide gas and magnesium metal.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.3  Balancing Chemical Equations ==

In another example of a chemical reaction, sodium metal reacts with chlorine gas to form solid sodium chloride.  An equation describing this process is shown below.[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/5.2.html Figure 5.2]

Na ''(s)''  +  Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' →   NaCl ''(s)''

Inspection of this equation, however, shows that, while there is one sodium atom on each side of the arrow, there are two chlorine atoms in the reactants and only one in the products.  This equation is '''not balanced''', and is therefore ''not'' a valid chemical equation.  In order to balance this equation, we must insert '''coefficients''' (not ''subscripts'') in front of the appropriate reactants or products so that ''the same number and types of atoms appear on both sides of the equation.''  Because chlorine is diatomic, there are two chlorines in the reactants and there must also be two chlorines in the products.  In order to accomplish this, we place the coefficient “2” in front of the product, NaCl.  Now we are balanced for chlorine, but there are two atoms of sodium in the products and only one shown in the reactants.  To resolve this, we need to place the coefficient “2” in front of the sodium in the reactant, to give the equation shown below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

2 Na ''(s)''  +  Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' →   2 NaCl ''(s)''

In this equation, there are two sodiums in the reactants, two sodiums in the products, two chlorines in the reactants and two chlorines in the products;  '''the equation is now balanced'''.

There are many different strategies that people use in order to balance chemical equations.  The simplest methods, where you examine and modify coefficients in some systematic order, is generally called “balancing by inspection”.  These methods are generally useful for most simple chemical equations, although mathematical algorithms are often necessary for highly complex reactions.  One version of the “inspection” method that we will use in this section can be called the “'''odd-even'''” approach.  Looking at the first equation that we wrote for the sodium-chlorine reaction, we note that there are an '''odd''' number of chlorines in the products and an '''even''' number of chlorines in the reactants.  The first thing we did in balancing this equation was to insert the multiplier “2” in front of the product (NaCl) so that there were now an ''even'' number of chlorines on both sides of the equation.  Once we did that, we simply had to balance the other element (Na) which was “odd” on both sides, and the equation was easily balanced.  When you are using this approach with more complicated equations, it is often useful to begin by balancing the '''most complex molecule''' in the equation first (the one with the most atoms), and focus on the element in this compound that is present in the '''greatest amount'''.

Another example where the “odd-even” approach works well is the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to yield water and oxygen gas, as shown below.

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)'' →   O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ''(l)''

As we inspect this equation, we note that there are an even number of oxygen atoms in the reactants and an odd number of oxygens in the products.  Specifically, water has only one oxygen (in the products) and the number of oxygen atoms in the products can be made “even” by inserting the coefficient “2” in front of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.  Doing this (shown below) we note that we now have four hydrogens in the products and only two in the reactants.

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)'' →   O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ''(l)''

Balancing the hydrogens by inserting “2” in front of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the reactants gives us an equation with four hydrogens on both sides on four oxygens on both sides;  '''the equation is now balanced'''.

2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)'' →   O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ''(l)''

Iron(III) oxide reacts with chlorine gas to give iron(III) chloride and oxygen gas, &lt;br&gt;    according to the equation shown below;  '''balance this equation'''.&lt;br&gt;_____Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)''  +  _____Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''  →   _____FeCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)''  +  _____O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''

  f. Sodium metal reacts with ammonia to give sodium amide and hydrogen gas, &lt;br&gt;    according to the equation shown below;  '''balance this equation'''.&lt;br&gt;_____Na ''(s)''  +  _____NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(l)'' →   _____H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''  +  _____NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)''

  g. Ethane reacts with oxygen gas to give carbon dioxide and water vapor, &lt;br&gt;according to the equation shown below;  '''balance this equation'''.&lt;br&gt;_____C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''  +  _____O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' →   _____CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''  +  _____H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ''(g)''


== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.4  Classifying  Chemical Reactions ==

The reactions we have examined in the previous sections can be classified into a few simple types.  Organizing reactions in this way is useful because it will assist us in predicting the products of unknown reactions.  There are many different classifications of chemical reactions, but here we will focus on the following types:  '''synthesis''', '''decomposition''', '''single replacement''' and '''double replacement'''.  In addition, we will see that some of these reactions involve changes in the oxidation numbers of the reactants and products; these will be referred to as '''oxidation-reduction''', or “'''redox'''” reactions.

The first type of reaction we will consider is a '''synthesis''' reaction (also called a ''combination'' reaction).  In a synthesis reaction, elements or compounds undergo reaction and combine to form a single new substance.  The reaction of sodium metal with chlorine gas to give sodium chloride is an example of a synthesis reaction where both reactants are elements.

2 Na ''(s)''  +  Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' →   2 NaCl ''(s)''

In this reaction, sodium metal and chlorine gas have ''combined'' to yield (synthesize) the more complex molecule, sodium chloride.  Another example of a synthesis reaction, where compounds are involved as reactants, is the reaction of the ''organic'' molecule ethene (a carbon-based molecule – covered in more depth in Chapter 14) with HBr to yield the organic molecule bromoethane.

In this example, two molecular compounds (the organic compound, '''ethene''', and hydrogen bromide) have combined to yield (synthesize) the new molecule, '''bromoethane'''.  In a similar manner, synthesis reaction can also involve elements reacting with compounds.

In '''decomposition''' reactions, a single compound will break down to form two or more  new substances.  The substances formed can be elements, compounds, or a mixture of both elements and compounds.  Two simple examples of decomposition reactions are shown below.

Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S ''(s)'' →   2 Cu ''(s)''  +  S ''(s)''

CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)'' →   CaO ''(s)''  +  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''

In a '''single-replacement reaction''' (also called a single-displacement reaction) an element and a compound will react so that their elements are switched.  In other words, an element will typically displace another element from within a compound.  As a general rule, '''metals''' will replace '''metals''' in compounds and '''non-metals''' will typically replace '''non-metals'''.  An example of a single replacement reaction is shown below.

Zn ''(s)''  +  CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)'' →  ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)''  +  Cu ''(s)''

In this example, elemental zinc has ''displaced'' the metal, copper, from copper(II) chloride to form zinc chloride and elemental copper.  In the reactants, zinc was elemental and in the products, it is present within the compound, zinc chloride.  Likewise, copper was present in a compound in the reactants and is elemental in the products.

In another example, iron metal will react with an aqueous solution of copper sulfate to give copper metal and iron(II) sulfate.

Fe ''(s)''  +  CuSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)'' →   Cu ''(s)''  +  FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)''

In this reaction, elemental iron replaces copper in a compound with sulfate anion and elemental copper metal is formed;  metal replaces metal.  The tendency of metals to replace other metals in single-replacement reactions is often referred to as an activity series.  In the activity series shown below, any metal will replace any other metal which is to the right of itself in the series.  Thus, iron will replace copper, as shown above, but copper metal would not replace iron from iron sulfate (iron is more active than copper). The activity series is useful in predicting whether a given single-replacement reaction will occur or not.  Note that hydrogen is also included in the table, although it is not generally considered a “metal”.  Within this table, metals which occur before hydrogen will react with acids to form hydrogen gas and metal salts.  Copper, silver, mercury and gold are less active than hydrogen and will not liberate hydrogen from simple acids.  The metals in Groups I &amp; II of the periodic table (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, Ca, Sr and Ba) are so reactive that they will directly react with water to liberate hydrogen gas and form metal hydroxides.  These are generally referred to as “'''active metals'''”.

These are generally referred to as “'''active metals'''”. [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/5.3.html Figure 5.3]

A '''double-replacement''' reaction (or double-displacement) two ionic compounds in aqueous solution switch anions and form two new compounds.  In order for a chemical reaction to occur in a double-replacement reaction, one of the new compounds that is formed must be ''insoluble'' in water, forming a solid '''precipitate''' (or a gas, to be covered in Chapter 6).  If both of the new compounds which are formed are water-soluble, then no reaction has occurred.  In the reactants, there were two cations and two anions in solution, and in the products there are the ''same'' two cations and two anions, in the ''same'' solution;  nothing has happened.  An example of a double-replacement reaction is shown below.

BaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)''  +  Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)'' →   BaSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)''  +  2 NaCl ''(aq)''

In this reaction, solid barium sulfate is formed as a precipitate.  This is a chemical change and this is a valid chemical reaction.  In order to predict whether a double-replacement reaction will occur or not you need to understand rules for predicting solubility of ionic compounds.  These rules will be covered in a later section, but are not related to the activity series discussed above. [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/5.4.html Figure 5.4]

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.5  Oxidation and Reduction in Chemical Reactions ==

The '''oxidation number''' of an element represents the total number of electrons which have been ''removed'' (a positive oxidation state) or ''added'' (a negative oxidation state) to get the element into its present state.  The term '''oxidation''' describes the ''loss'' of electrons by an element and an ''increase'' in oxidation state;  the term '''reduction''' describes the ''gain'' of electrons and a ''decrease'' in oxidation state.  Oxidation numbers for elements in compounds can be calculated using a simple set of rules, which are reproduced below in Table 5.3.

2.     A monoatomic ion will have an oxidation number that is equal to its charge.
|-
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |

In many chemical reactions, the oxidation number of elements change.  Consider the synthesis reaction shown below.  In the reactants, carbon and oxygen are both elements and their oxidation numbers are zero (Rule 1).  In the product, oxygen will have an oxidation number of –2 (Rule 4), therefore, carbon in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must have an oxidation number of +4 in order to balance the four negative charges on the oxygens.  During this reaction, the oxidation number of carbon has changed from zero in the reactants to +4 in the products and the oxidation number of oxygen has changed from zero to –2.  This is an example of a '''redox''' '''reaction'''&lt;nowiki&gt;;  &lt;/nowiki&gt;'''a chemical reaction in which the oxidation numbers of elements change on going from reactants to products.'''

C ''(s)''  +  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' →   CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''

In a redox reaction, the element that “'''loses electrons'''” is said to be '''oxidized''' and will have ''an increase in its oxidation number''.  In the example above, the oxidation number of carbon ''increases'' from zero to +4;  it has “lost electrons” and has been '''oxidized'''.  The element that “'''gains electrons'''” in a redox reaction is said to be '''reduced''' and will have a ''decrease in its oxidation number''.  In the reaction above, the oxidation number of oxygen has ''decreased'' from zero to –2;  it has “gained electrons” and has been '''reduced'''.


'''&lt;big&gt;[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp5.2.html Example 5.2] Recognizing Redox Reactions &lt;/big&gt;'''

'''&lt;big&gt;[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex5.3.html Exercise 5.3]  Recognizing Redox Reactions&lt;/big&gt;'''

For each of the reactions given below, calculate the oxidation number of each of the elements &lt;br&gt;    in the reactants and the products and determine if the reaction involves oxidation-reduction.  &lt;br&gt;    If it is a redox reaction, identify the elements that have been oxidized and reduced.

  Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S    →   2 Cu   +  S&lt;br&gt;    Reactants:  Cu _____  S _____               &lt;br&gt;    Products:   Cu _____  S _____&lt;br&gt;    Element oxidized: __________                Element Reduced __________

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.6  Predicting Products from Chemical Reactions==

Part of the lure of chemistry is that things don’t always work out the way you expect.  You plan a reaction, anticipate the products and, quite often, the results astound you!  The exercise, then, is trying to figure out what was formed, why, and whether your observation leads to other useful generalizations.  The first step in this process of discovery is anticipating or predicting the products which are likely to be formed in a given chemical reaction.  The guidelines we describe here will accurately predict the products of most classes of simple chemical reactions.  As your experience in chemistry grows, however, you will begin to appreciate the unexpected! [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/5.5.html Figure 5.5]

In simple '''synthesis''' reactions involving reaction of elements, such as aluminum metal reacting with chlorine gas, the product will be a simple compound containing both elements.  In this case, it is easiest to consider the common charges that the elements adopt as ions and build your product accordingly.  Aluminum is a Group III element and will typically form a +3 ion.  Chlorine, being Group VII, will accept one electron and form a monoanion.  Putting these predictions together, the product is likely to be '''AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''.  In fact, if aluminum metal and chlorine gas are allowed to react, solid AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the predominant product.

2 Al ''(s)''  +  3 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' →   2 AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)''

The '''synthesis''' reaction involving the non-metals hydrogen gas and bromine can be approached similarly.  The product will contain both elements.  Hydrogen, Group I, has one valence electron and will form one covalent bond.  Bromine, Group VII, has seven valence electrons and will form one covalent bond.  The likely product is therefore '''HBr''', with one covalent bond between the hydrogen and the bromine.

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''  +  Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' &lt; →   2 HBr ''(g)''

For a '''single-replacement''' reaction, recall that (in general) metals will replace metals and non-metals will replace non-metals.  For the reaction between lead(IV) chloride and fluorine gas, the fluorine will replace the chlorine, leading to a compound between lead and fluorine and the production of '''elemental chlorine'''.  The lead can be viewed as a “spectator” in the reaction and the product is likely to be '''lead(IV) fluoride'''.  The complete equation is shown below.

PbCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)''  +  2 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' →   PbF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)''  +  2 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''

In single-replacement reactions in which metals (or carbon or hydrogen) are expected to replace metals, first you should check the activity series to see if any reaction is anticipated.  Remember that metals can only replace metals that are ''less active'' than themselves (to the right in the Table).  If the reaction is predicted to occur, use the same general guidelines that we used above.  For example, solid iron reacting with aqueous sulfuric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).  In this reaction the question is whether iron will displace hydrogen and form hydrogen gas.  Consulting the activity series, we see that hydrogen is to the ''right'' of iron, meaning that the reaction is expected to occur.  Next, we reason that iron will replace hydrogen, leading to the formation of iron sulfate, where the sulfate is the “spectator” ion.  The formation of hydrogen gas requires a change in oxidation number in the hydrogen of +1 to zero.  Two hydrogen atoms must therefore be '''reduced''' (a ''decrease'' in oxidation number) and the two electrons required for the reduction must come from the iron.  The charge on the iron is therefore most likely to be +2 (it starts off at zero and donates two electrons to the hydrogens).  The final product is therefore most likely '''iron(II) sulfate'''. The complete equation is shown below.

Fe ''(s)''  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)'' →   FeSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)''  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''

'''Decomposition''' reactions are the most difficult to predict, but there are some general trends that are useful.  For example, most '''metal carbonates''' will decompose on heating to yield the '''metal oxide''' and '''carbon dioxide'''.

NiCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)'' →   NiO ''(s)''  +  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''

'''Metal hydrogen carbonates''' also decompose on heating to give the '''metal carbonate''', '''carbon dioxide''' and '''water'''.

2 NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)'' →   Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)''  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ''(g)''  +  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''

Finally, many '''oxygen-containing compounds''' will decompose on heating to yield '''oxygen gas''' and “other compounds”.  Identifying these compounds and building an understanding of why and how they are formed is one of the challenges of chemistry.  Some examples:

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)'' →   O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ''(l)''

2 HgO ''(s)'' →   O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''  +  2 Hg ''(l)''

2 KClO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)'' →   3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''  +  2 KCl ''(s)''

The potential products in '''double-replacement''' reactions are simple to predict;  the anions and cations simply exchange.  Remember, however, that one of the products must '''precipitate''', otherwise no chemical reaction has occurred.  For the reaction between lead(II) nitrate and potassium iodide, the products are predicted to be lead(II) iodide and potassium nitrate.  No redox occurs, and the product, lead iodide, precipitates from the solution as a bright yellow solid.  The question of how do you predict this type of solubility trend is addressed in the next section.

Pb(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)''  +  2 KI''(aq)''&lt; →    PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)''  +  2 KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)''

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.7  Predicting Solubility Trends ==

The solubility of many simple ionic compounds can be predicted by applying the set of rules shown below.

5.    With exception of the alkali metal ions and ammonium (''Rule 1''), the following salts are generally '''insoluble'''&lt;nowiki&gt;:  metal carbonates (CO&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;),  metal phosphates (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt;) and metal chromates (CrO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;).

Applying these rules to the reaction between lead nitrate and potassium iodide, the reactants are both '''soluble''' (Rule 1 and Rule 2).  In the products, potassium nitrate will be soluble (Rule 2) and lead iodide will be '''insoluble''', based on Rule 3.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;5.8  The Energetics of Chemical Reactions ==

Many of the chemical reactions that we have discussed in this chapter occur with the generation of significant amounts of light and heat.  A prime example is the synthesis reaction between zinc and sulfur, described by the equation shown below.

Zn ''(s)''  +  S ''(s)'' →   ZnS ''(s)''&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Initially, both elements are present as fine powders.  They are mixed (carefully) and the mixture is stable sitting of the laboratory bench.  When the mixture is touched with a heated metal rod, however, a violent reaction occurs (the reaction is termed '''''exothermic'''''&lt;nowiki&gt;;  producing heat) and zinc sulfide is formed as the product.  The reaction is obviously favorable, so why does it need heat to start the reaction?  This concept can be understood by considering a &lt;/nowiki&gt;'''reaction coordinate diagram''' for a simple one-step reaction (Figure 5.8). [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/5.8.html Figure 5.8]

In a reaction coordinate diagram, the y-axis corresponds to energy.  The initial and final “energy wells” represent the ground-state energies of the reactants and products, and the path connecting them describes the energy changes that occur in the course of the reaction.

Looking at the reaction coordinate diagram for the zinc sulfide reaction, the reactants sit at an initial energy level that is characteristic and unique for each element or compound.  Likewise, zinc sulfide sits at a lower overall energy level;  that means that the conversion from the elements to the compound is '''favorable''' and that heat is ''liberated'' during the reaction.  If the energy level of the products was ''higher'' than the reactants, the reaction would be ''unfavorable'' and heat would be ''absorbed'' during the reaction (the reaction is said to be '''endothermic'''&lt;nowiki&gt;;  consuming heat).&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Why, then, does the zinc sulfide reaction need energy input before the reaction begins?  The answer lies in the curved path that connects the reactants and products in the reaction coordinate diagram.  In order for the zinc-sulfur mixture to react, enough energy must be put ''into'' the system so that the energy level of the reactants equals the highest hill in the diagram.  Once that point is reached, the reactants can “tumble down” the energy hill and form the more stable products (with the evolution of all of the excess energy as heat, light, etc.).

The top of the energy hill in a reaction coordinate diagram is called the '''transition state''' (or activated complex).  In modern chemical theory, the transition state is the energy maximum corresponding to the processes of bond-making and bond-breaking.  The energy required to go from the reactants to the transition state is the '''activation energy'''.  Reactions that occur with little requirement for heat simply have a small activation energy.  The magnitude of the activation energy controls the ''rate'' of a reaction and the ''difference'' in energy between the reactants and the products controls the equilibrium distribution of the products and reactants in a reversible reaction.  We will return to these concepts when we address reaction rates and equilibrium later in the book.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;  '''''Study Points''''' ==
* The processes that occur during a chemical change can be represented using a '''chemical equation'''.  In a chemical equation, the chemical formulas for the substance or substances that ''undergo'' the chemical reaction (the '''reactants''') and the formulas for the new substance or substances that are formed (the '''products''') are both shown, and are linked by an '''arrow'''.  The arrow in a chemical equation has the properties of an “equals sign” in mathematics, and because of this, '''''in a chemical equation, there must be the same number and types of atoms on each side of the arrow.'''''
* A chemical equation in which the same number and types of atoms appear on each side of the arrow is called balanced.  In order to balance an equation, insert '''coefficients''' in front of the appropriate reactants or products until there are the same number and types of atoms on both sides of the arrow.
* In a '''synthesis reaction''', elements or compounds undergo reaction and combine to form a '''single new substance'''. ''''''
* In a '''decomposition''' reaction, a single compound will break down to form two or more new substances.  The substances formed can be elements, compounds, or a mixture of both. ''''''
* In a '''single-replacement''' (single-displacement) '''reaction,''' an element and a compound will react so that their elements are switched.  As a general rule, '''metals''' will replace '''metals''' in compounds and '''non-metals''' will typically replace '''non-metals'''. ''''''
* A '''double-replacement''' (double-displacement) reaction, two ionic compounds in aqueous solution switch anions and form two new compounds.  In order for a chemical reaction to occur, one of the new compounds that is formed must be ''insoluble'' in water, forming a solid '''precipitate''' or a gas. ''''''
* The '''oxidation number''' of an element represents the total number of electrons which have been ''removed'' (a positive oxidation state) or ''added'' (a negative oxidation state) to get the element into its present state.  The term '''oxidation''' describes the ''loss'' of electrons by an element and an ''increase'' in oxidation state;  the term '''reduction''' describes the ''gain'' of electrons and a ''decrease'' in oxidation state. ''''''
* A chemical reaction in which oxidation numbers undergo a change is called a '''redox reaction'''.  In a redox reaction, the element that “'''loses electrons'''” is said to be '''oxidized''' and will have ''an increase in its oxidation number''. The element that “'''gains electrons'''” in a redox reaction is said to be '''reduced''' and will have a ''decrease in its oxidation number''.
* In a simple '''synthesis''' '''reaction''' involving reaction of elements, the product will be a compound containing both elements.  Write the product considering the common charges that the elements adopt as ions or the number of bonds that the elements typically form in molecules.
* In a simple '''single-replacement''' reaction, (in general) ''metals'' (including '''carbon''' and '''hydrogen''') will tend to replace ''metals'' and that ''non-metals'' will replace ''non-metals''.
* In a '''double-replacement''' reaction, the anions and cations simply of the two compounds simply exchange.  In order for a reaction to occur, one of the products must '''precipitate''', otherwise no chemical reaction has occurred.  Changes in oxidation numbers do not occur in double-replacement reactions.
* Solubility trends can be predicted using a simple set of rules shown in Table 5.5;  you should review there rules, remembering to apply them ''in order''.
* The energy required to initiate a chemical reaction is called the '''activation energy'''.  The greater the activation energy, the slower, or less favorable a reaction will be.  The magnitude of the activation energy is directly linked to the ''rate'' of a chemical reaction.&lt;p&gt;

'''With the background that we have built in this course, thus far, we can now approach a more quantitative view of chemistry. While the notion of chemistry and math (together in the same room) may make you want to scream, we will see in this chapter that concepts such as chemical stoichiometry and mass balance are not overwhelming and can be approached using the same problem-solving algorithms that we have mastered in previous chapters. Once the concept of stoichiometric balance has been mastered, we will finally tackle limiting reactants. Limiting reactant problems may appear challenging, but we will see it is the same calculation that we do routinely… we simply have to do the calculations twice.'''

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''6.1 An Introduction to Stoichiometry'''==

''Stoichiometry''… what a wonderful word! It sounds so complex and so ''chemical''. In fact, it’s a fairly simple concept; '''stoichiometry''' is the relationship between the molar masses of chemical reactants and products in a given chemical reaction. In Chapter 5 we learned to balance chemical equations by inserting numerical coefficients in front of reactants or products so that there were the same number and types of atoms on each side of the equation. Thus, in the reaction between sodium metal and chlorine gas, the balanced chemical equation is: [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/6.1.html Figure 6.1]

&lt;center&gt;2 Na ''(s)'' + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''  &amp;rarr;  2 NaCl ''(s)''&lt;/center&gt;

This equation tells us that two atoms of sodium react with one molecule of chlorine gas to give two sodium chlorides. The coefficients in front of the sodium and the sodium chloride are called the '''stoichiometric coefficients''' for this reaction. If we were to totally react a single molecule of chlorine gas in this reaction, this stoichiometry tells us that two atoms of sodium (atomic mass 22.99) having a total mass of 45.98 amu, would react with one molecule of chlorine gas (having a mass 70.90 amu) to give two sodium chlorides (formula mass 137.94), for a total of 275.9 amu of product. Because chemists usually don’t speak of chemical reactions in terms of individual atoms or molecules, it is much more common to describe the stoichiometry of a reaction in terms of grams of reactants and products, or more conveniently in terms of moles. '''Molar stoichiometry''' is simply the expression of the coefficients of a reaction in terms of moles of reactants and products.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''6.2 An Molar Stoichiometry in Chemical Equations'''==

If we were to describe the reaction of sodium metal with chlorine gas in molar terms, we would say that two ''moles'' of sodium metal combine with one ''mole'' of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to give two ''moles'' of sodium chloride. In terms of mass, two moles of sodium, having a total mass of 45.98 grams, would react with one mole of chlorine gas (a mass 70.90 grams) to give two moles of sodium chloride, for a total of 275.9 grams of product. Likewise, the molar stoichiometry for the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to form oxygen and water, can be described simply as ''two moles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decompose to form one mole of oxygen gas and two moles of water.''

&lt;center&gt;2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)''  &amp;rarr;  O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ''(l)''&lt;/center&gt;

The stoichiometric coefficients for this reaction gives us the key information about the relationship between molar quantities of reactants and products, but in the real world, we will not always be working with exactly two moles of hydrogen peroxide. What if you want to know how much oxygen gas will be formed when 0.28 moles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decompose? One way to solve this type of problem is to utilize a tool that we will call a ''reaction pathway''. The reaction pathway is a kind of simple map of the stoichiometry of a reaction, which uses arrows to show the relationship between reactants and products. For any simple reaction, a pathway can be drawn linking the reactants and products as follows:
[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Scheme6.1.html Scheme 1]

Using the '''''given-find-ratio''''' algorithm that we introduced back in Chapter 1, if we were given ''mol reactant'' and we wanted to find ''mol product'', we could set up a simple equation as follows:  [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Scheme6.2.html Scheme 2]


&lt;math&gt;\left( mol product \right)=\left( mol reactant \right)\left( \frac{mol product}{mol reactant} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The units ''mol reactant'' cancel to give the solution in ''mol product.'' If we were given ''mol product'' and we wanted to find ''mol reactant'', we would set up the equation as follows in order for the units to properly cancel:


&lt;math&gt;\left( mol reactant \right)=\left( mol product \right)\left( \frac{mol reactant}{mol product} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

This basic approach can be used to solve for any'' ''molar (mass, or gas) conversion based on a balanced chemical equation, as long as you are careful to set up the ratios so that the units cancel, giving you the desired solution with the proper units. As an example, return to the question of the decomposition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If 0.28 moles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; decompose, according to the equation given below, how many moles of oxygen gas (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) will be formed?  [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Scheme6.3.html Scheme 3]



&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{1\text{ mol O}_{\text{2}}}{\text{2 mol H}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{2}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

We set up the problem to solve for mol product;'' ''the general equation is: 


&lt;math&gt;\left( mol product \right)=\left( mol reactant \right)\left( \frac{mol product}{mol reactant} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The stoichiometric mole ratio is set up so that ''mol reactant'' will cancel, giving a solution in ''mol product.'' Substituting, [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Scheme6.4.html Scheme 4]


&lt;math&gt;\left( x \text{mol O}_{\text{2}} \right)=\left( \text{0}\text{.28 mol H}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{2}} \right)\times \left( \frac{1\text{ mol O}_{\text{2}}}{\text{2 mol H}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{2}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
= 0.14 mol O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;


Thus, the decomposition of 0.28 mol of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will produce 0.14 mol of the product, oxygen gas (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp6.1.html ''' Example 6.1  Using Molar Stoichiometry''']

 a. Iron (III) oxide reacts with hydrogen gas to form elemental iron and water, according to the balanced&lt;br&gt;   equation shown below. How many moles of iron will be formed from the reduction of excess iron (III) &lt;br&gt;  oxide by 0.58 moles of hydrogen gas? 

 b. When an impure sample containing an unknown amount of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is reacted with&lt;br&gt;   ''excess'' hydrogen gas, 0.16 moles of solid Fe are formed. How many moles of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;br&gt;  were in the original sample?

Ammonia is produced industrially from nitrogen and hydrogen according to the equation:

 a. If you are given 6.2 moles of nitrogen how many mole of ammonia could you produce?

 b. How many moles of hydrogen would you need to fully react with 6.2 moles of nitrogen?

 c. If you wished to produce 11 moles of ammonia how many moles of nitrogen would you need to start with?


== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''6.3 Mass Calculations'''==

The methods described in the previous section allow us to express reactants and products in terms of moles, but what if we wanted to know how many ''grams ''of a reactant would be required to produce a given number of ''grams'' of a certain product? This logical extension is, of course, trivial! In Chapter 4, we learned to express molar quantities in terms of the ''masses'' of reactants or products. For example, the reduction of iron (III) oxide by hydrogen gas, produces metallic iron and water. If we were to ask how many grams of elemental iron will be formed by the reduction of 1.0 grams of iron (III) oxide, we would simply use the molar stoichiometry to determine the number of moles of iron that would be produced, and then convert moles into grams using the known molar mass. For example, one gram of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be converted into mol Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by remembering that moles of a substance is equivalent to grams of that substance divided by the molar mass of that substance:  [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/6.3.html Figure 6.3]


&lt;math&gt;moles=\left( \frac{grams}{molar\ mass} \right)=\left( \frac{grams}{{}^{grams}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{mol}\;} \right)=\left( grams \right)\times \left( {}^{mol}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{grams}\; \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Using this approach, the mass of a reactant can be inserted into our reaction pathway as the ratio of mass-to-molar mass. This is shown here for the reduction of 1.0 gram of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Scheme6.5.html Scheme 5]


''' Given:''' 
&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\text{1}\text{.0 g Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}}{1\text{59}\text{.70 }\frac{\text{g Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}}{\text{mol Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}}} \right)\text{ }&lt;/math&gt;
'''Find''': ''x'' mol Fe


We set up the problem to solve for ''mol product''; the general equation is:


&lt;math&gt;\left( mol product \right)=\left( mol reactant \right)\times \left( \frac{mol product}{mol reactant} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The stoichiometric mole ratio is set up so that mol reactant will cancel, giving a solution in ''mol product.'' Substituting,


&lt;math&gt;x\text{ mol Fe=}\left( \frac{\text{1}\text{.0 g Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}}{1\text{59}\text{.70 }\frac{\text{g Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}}{\text{mol Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}}} \right)\times \left( \frac{\text{2 mol Fe}}{\text{1 mol Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

It is often simpler to express the ratio (mass)/(molar mass) as shown below, 


&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\text{1}\text{.0 g Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}}{1\text{59}\text{.70 }\frac{\text{g Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}}{\text{mol Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}}} \right)=\left( \text{1}\text{.0 g Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}} \right)\times \left( \frac{1\text{ mol Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}}{1\text{59}\text{.70 g Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Doing this, and rearranging, 


&lt;math&gt;x\text{ mol Fe=}\left( \text{1}\text{.0 g Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}} \right)\times \left( \frac{1\text{ mol Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}}{1\text{59}\text{.70 g Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}} \right)\times \text{ }\left( \frac{\text{2 mol Fe}}{\text{1 mol Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
= 0.013 mol 

That is, the reduction of 1.0 grams of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; by excess hydrogen gas will produce 0.013 moles of elemental iron. All of these calculations are good to two significant figures based on the mass of iron (III) oxide in the original problem (1.0 grams). Note that we have ''two'' conversion factors (ratios) in this solution; one from mass to molar mass and the second, the stoichiometric mole ratio from the balanced chemical equation. Knowing that we have 0.013 moles of Fe, we could now convert that into grams by knowing that one mole of Fe has a mass of 55.85 grams; the yield would be 0.70 grams.

We could also modify our basic set-up so that we could find the number of ''grams'' of iron directly. Our modified pathway would look like this:  [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Scheme6.6.html Scheme 6]

Here we have simply substituted the quantity (''moles''  ''molar mass'') to get mass of iron that would be produced. Again, we set up the problem to solve for ''mol product'';


&lt;math&gt;\left( mol product \right)=\left( mol reactant \right)\left( \frac{mol product}{mol reactant} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

In place of ''mol product'' and ''mol reactant'', we use the expressions for ''mass'' and ''molar mass'', as shown in the scheme above. The stoichiometric mole ratio is set up so that ''mol reactant'' (the '''''given''''') will cancel, giving a solution in ''mol product''. Substituting,


&lt;math&gt;\left( x\text{ mol Fe} \right)\left( \text{ }\frac{5\text{5}\text{.85g Fe}}{\text{1 mol Fe}} \right)\text{=}\left( \text{1 g Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}\text{ } \right)\left( \frac{\text{1 mol Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}}{1\text{59}\text{.70 g Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}} \right)\times \text{ }\left( \frac{\text{2 mol Fe}}{\text{1 mol Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging and canceling units,


&lt;math&gt;x\text{ g Fe=}\left( 5\text{5}\text{.85 }\frac{\text{g Fe}}{\text{mol Fe}} \right)\left( \frac{\text{1 g Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}\text{ }\times \text{ mol Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}}{1\text{59}\text{.70 g Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}} \right)\left( \frac{\text{2 mol Fe}}{\text{1 mol Fe}_{\text{2}}\text{O}_{\text{3}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
= 0.70 g

 b. If you have 6.2 grams of nitrogen how many grams of hydrogen would you need?


== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''6.4 Percentage Yield'''==

When we use stoichiometric calculations to predict quantities in a reaction, our results are based on the assumption that everything happens in reality exactly as described by the chemical equation. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. When you work in the laboratory, things often go wrong. When you are weighing out reactants and transferring the materials to reaction vessels, some material will often remain on the spatula or in the weighing vessel. As you collect product, some may spill, or in a vigorous reaction, material may escape from the reaction vessel. Stoichiometric calculations will give you a '''theoretical yield''' for a reaction; the yield that you should obtain assuming that the reaction proceeds with 100% efficiency and that no material is lost in handling. The amount of material that you isolate from a given reaction is called the '''actual yield''' and it is always less than the theoretical yield. The ''percentage ''of the theoretical yield that you actually isolate is called the '''percentage yield'''.

Consider the reaction between silver nitrate and sodium chloride to form solid silver chloride. If we react 10.00 grams silver nitrate with excess sodium chloride, we would predict that we would obtain:  [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Scheme6.7.html Scheme 6.7]

We set up the problem to solve for mol product; the general equation is:


&lt;math&gt;\left( mol product \right)=\left( mol reactant \right)\times \left( \frac{mol product}{mol reactant} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


For ''mol product'' and ''mol reactant'', we use the expressions for (mass)/(molar mass), as shown in the scheme above. The stoichiometric mole ratio is set up so that mol reactant will cancel, giving a solution in mol product. Substituting,


&lt;math&gt;\left( x\text{ g AgCl} \right)\left( \frac{\text{1 mol AgCl}}{1\text{4}3.32\text{ g AgCl}} \right)\text{ =}\left( 1\text{0}\text{.00 g AgNO}_{\text{3}} \right)\left( \frac{\text{1 mol AgNO}_{\text{3}}}{\text{169}\text{.88 g AgNO}_{\text{3}}} \right)\times \left( \frac{1\text{ mol AgCl}}{\text{1 mol AgNO}_{\text{3}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

or,


&lt;math&gt;\left( x\text{ g AgCl} \right)\text{=}\left( 1\text{0}\text{.00 g AgNO}_{\text{3}} \right)\left( \frac{\text{1 mol AgNO}_{\text{3}}}{\text{169}\text{.88 g AgNO}_{\text{3}}} \right)\times \left( \frac{1\text{ mol AgCl}}{\text{1 mol AgNO}_{\text{3}}} \right)\times \left( \frac{1\text{4}3.32\text{ g AgCl}}{\text{1 mol AgCl}} \right)\text{ }&lt;/math&gt;
= 8.440 g


This mass, calculated from the masses of starting materials and the stoichiometry of the equation is the theoretical yield. Because the silver chloride is a precipitate from an aqueous solution, however, we must filter it, dry it, transfer it to our balance and weigh it, before we can measure how much product we obtain as our actual yield. As we filter it, a small amount of solid is likely to remain stuck to the sides of the flask. When it is dry and we transfer it to the balance, some solid will remain on the filter paper, some on the spatula, and (most likely) your lab partner will sneeze at an inopportune moment and blow some of it all over the desktop. Considering all of this, it is very unlikely that we will end up with an actual yield of 8.044 grams of solid AgCl. 

Let’s assume that we have done all of these operations (including the sneeze) and when we weigh our solid AgCl, we actually obtain 7.98 grams of solid. We know that we obtain 7.98 grams of product (our actual yield) and we calculated that we should obtain 8.440 grams of product (the theoretical yield). The percentage of the theoretical yield that we obtain is called the '''percentage yield''', and is calculated as (actual yield)/(theoretical yield)  100. In the present case:


&lt;math&gt;\left( {}^{7.98\text{ g}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{8}\text{.440 g}}\; \right)\times 100=94.5%&lt;/math&gt;


The percentage yield of solid AgCl that we obtained in this reaction is therefore 94.5% (not bad, actually, considering your lab partner). The concept of percentage yield is generally applied to all experimental work in chemistry.

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp6.4.html ''' Example 6.4 Percentage Yield''']

 Powdered zinc and solid sulfur combine explosively to form zinc sulfide. You and your lab partner carefully&lt;br&gt;   mix 0.010 mole of solid zinc powder with exactly 0.010 mole of powdered sulfur in a small&lt;br&gt;   porcelain crucible. Knowing your lab partner, you allow your instructor to ignite the mixture. &lt;br&gt;  The explosion forms a cloud of ZnS, scatters some all over the ground, and leaves a crusty pile of &lt;br&gt;  product in the crucible. You transfer this and determine that 0.35 grams of solid product has been recovered. &lt;br&gt;  Calculate the percentage yield.


[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex6.3.html ''' Exercise 6.3 Percentage Yield  ''']

The Harber process is used making ammonia from nitrogen and hydrogen according to the equation shown below. The yield of the reaction, however, is not 100%. 

&lt;center&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;rarr;  2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

 Suppose you end up with 6.2 moles of ammonia, but the reaction stoichiometry predicts that you should &lt;br&gt;  have 170.0 grams of ammonia. What is the percent yield for this reaction?

 If you started with 6.2 grams of nitrogen and you produce 6.2 grams of ammonia what would be the percent yield?


== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''6.5 Limiting Reactants'''==

Gloves will typically come is right- and left-handed models. In order to make a ''pair'' of gloves, you need one that is designed to fit each hand. If you had a box containing 50 left-handed gloves and another box containing 40 right-handed gloves, you could make 40 proper pairs and you would have ten left-handed gloves left over. The number of pairs of gloves that you could assemble is ''limited'' by the glove in the smallest number (the right-handed glove). The other glove in this example, the left, is present in ''excess''.  [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/6.6.html Figure 6.6]

The same sort of logic applies to chemical reactions in which there are two or more reactants. In Example 6.4, we carefully weighed out 0.010 mole of solid zinc and solid sulfur in order to react them to form 0.010 mole of the product, ZnS. If instead, we had reacted 0.010 mole of Zn with 0.020 moles of sulfur, how much ZnS would have (theoretically) formed? The answer is still 0.010 mole of ZnS. What happens to the leftover sulfur? It just sits there! When the reaction is complete, there is (theoretically) 0.010 mole of ZnS mixed with the remaining 0.010 mole of sulfur. This is shown graphically in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/6.7.html Figure 6.7]; 10 atoms of Zn reacting with 20 atoms of S yield 10 molecules of ZnS with 10 atoms of S remaining.


You may have noticed that, in many of the problems in this chapter, we stated that one reactant reacted with an ''excess'' of a second reactant. In all of these cases, the theoretical yield of product is determined by the limiting reactant in the reaction, and some of the excess reactant is left over. If aluminum and chlorine gas, a diatomic gas, react to form aluminum chloride according to the equation shown below,

&lt;center&gt;2 Al ''(s)'' + 3 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''  &amp;rarr;  2 AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)''&lt;/center&gt;

and there are 2.0 moles of aluminum and 14 moles of chlorine present, two moles of aluminum chloride are formed and 11 moles of chlorine gas remain in excess. Our stoichiometry is:


&lt;math&gt;\left( {}^{3\text{ mol Cl}_{\text{2}}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{2 mol AlCl}_{\text{3}}}\; \right)&lt;/math&gt;

If three moles of chlorine gas are used in the reaction, (14 – 3) = 11 moles of chlorine must remain. When a problem is presented and one reactant is labeled as excess, the theoretical yield of product is equal to the moles of the limiting reagent, adjusted for the stoichiometry of the reaction. 


Although it would be easier if reactants were routinely labeled as “limiting” or “excess”, more commonly problems are written in such a way that it is not always trivial to identify the limiting reactant. For example, if you were told that 6.0 grams of aluminum was reacted with 3.8 grams of chlorine gas and you were asked to calculate the mass of AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; that would be formed, there would be no simple way to identify the limiting- and excess reactants. In a case like this what you want to do is to simply solve the problem ''twice''. First you would calculate the number of moles of aluminum in 6.0 grams, and then calculate how many moles of AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; could be formed. Next, you calculate how many moles of chlorine are present in 3.8 grams of chlorine gas and again, calculate how many moles of AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; could be formed. Whichever reagent produces the ''smallest number of moles of product'' must be ''limiting'' and the other reagent must be in ''excess''. 

To work this example we can expand our standard scheme to show ''both'' reactants:
[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Scheme6.8.html Scheme 6.8]

'''Find''': ''x'' moles of AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

'''Find''': ''x'' moles of AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;


We set up the problem to solve for ''mol product'' for ''each'' reactant.'' ''The general equation is:


&lt;math&gt;\left( mol product \right)=\left( mol reactant \right)\times \left( \frac{mol product}{mol reactant} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The solutions for both reactants are:


&lt;math&gt;x\text{ mol AlCl}_{\text{3}}\text{=}\left( \text{6}\text{.0 g Al} \right)\left( \frac{\text{1 mol Al}}{\text{26}\text{.98 g Al}} \right)\left( \frac{\text{1 mol AlCl}}{\text{1 mol Al}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
, and 


&lt;math&gt;x\text{ mol AlCl}_{\text{3}}\text{=}\left( \text{3}\text{.8 g Cl}_{\text{2}} \right)\left( \frac{\text{1 mol Cl}_{\text{2}}}{\text{70}\text{.90 g Cl}_{\text{2}}} \right)\left( \frac{\text{2 mol AlCl}}{\text{3 mol Cl}_{\text{2}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


Solving these equations, we see that, beginning with 6.0 grams of aluminum, '''0.22 moles''' of AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be formed, and that, beginning with 3.8 grams of chlorine, '''0.036 moles''' of AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be formed.

Keeping score, 6.0 grams of Al yields 0.22 moles of AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and 3.8 grams of chlorine gas yields 0.036 moles of AlCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The ''lowest'' yield comes from the chlorine gas, therefore it must be ''limiting'' and aluminum must be in excess. The reaction in the problem will therefore produce 0.036 moles of product, which is equivalent to:


&lt;math&gt;0.036\text{ mol AlCl}_{\text{3}}\text{ }\left( 133.33\text{ }{}^{\text{g}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{mol}}\; \right)=4.8\text{ grams of AlCl}_{\text{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp6.5.html ''' Example 6.5 Limiting Reactant Problems''']
 
 Lead (IV) chloride reacts with fluorine gas to give lead (IV) fluoride and Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. &lt;br&gt;  If 0.023 moles of fluorine gas reacts with 5.3 grams of lead (IV) chloride, what mass of lead (IV) &lt;br&gt;  fluoride will be formed?

Although “limiting reactant problems” may be ''tedious'', they are not difficult. When you are faced with a limiting reactant problem, just remember, you do the simple molar yield calculations ''twice'', one for each reactant. The reactant that yields the ''lowest'' molar quantity is your limiting reagent and the molar value you calculate determines the theoretical yield in the problem.

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex6.4.html ''' Exercise 6.4 Limiting Reactants  ''']

Ammonia, which is the active ingredient in “smelling salts”, is prepared from nitrogen and hydrogen according to the equation shown below. 

&lt;center&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  &amp;rarr;  2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

 If you mix 5.0 mol of nitrogen and 10.0 moles of hydrogen how many moles of ammonia would you produce? &lt;br&gt;  Which reactant is in excess?

 If you have 6.2 grams of nitrogen and you react it with 6.2 grams of hydrogen how many grams of ammonia &lt;br&gt;  would you produce? Which reactant is the limiting reactant?


== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''Study Points'''==

* '''Stoichiometry''' is the relationship between the masses of chemical reactants and products in a given chemical reaction. The coefficients placed in a chemical equation in order to balance it are called the '''stoichiometric coefficients'''. '''Molar stoichiometry''' is simply the expression of the coefficients of a reaction in terms of moles of reactants and products. 
* In order to find the number of '''moles of a product''' that is produced in a chemical reaction when you are ''given'' '''moles of reactant''', simply multiply the moles of reactant by the ''stoichiometric ratio'' relating that reactant and the desired product; i.e., 
&lt;math&gt;\left( mol reactant \right)\times \left( \frac{mol product}{mol reactant} \right)&lt;/math&gt;.
* In order to find the number of '''moles of a product''' that are produced in a chemical reaction when you are ''given'' '''mass of reactant''', simply ''divide'' the mass of reactant by the '''molar mass''' (to get ''moles reactant'') and then ''multiply'' by the ''stoichiometric ratio'' relating that reactant and the desired product; i.e., 
&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{grams}{{}^{grams}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{mol}\;} \right)\times \left( \frac{mol product}{mol reactant} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
.
* Always remember, '''mass divided by molar mass equals moles'''; 
&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{grams}{\left( {}^{grams}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{mol}\; \right)} \right)=mol&lt;/math&gt;.
* The ''mass'' or the ''number of moles'' that you calculate for a product based on reaction stoichiometry is called the '''theoretical yield''' for the reaction. The amount of material that you actually isolate from a given reaction is called the '''actual yield''' and it is always less than the theoretical yield. The ratio of the actual and theoretical yields, expressed as a ''percentage'' is called the '''percentage yield'''. 
* '''''If''''' a reaction requires more than one reactant and '''''if''' ''you are given the mass, or the number of moles of ''each'' reactant, you must approach the calculation as a '''limiting reactant problem'''. To solve a limiting reactant problem, simply perform the standard mass calculation for ''each'' reactant, noting the mass (or number of moles) of product formed in each calculation. The reactant that yields the ''smallest'' amount or product from these calculations is called the '''limiting reactant'''. Reactants that yield ''larger'' amounts of products in these calculations are called '''excess reactants'''. The theoretical yield in the reaction will be based ''solely'' on the calculated amount for the limiting reactant.
* If a reactant in a chemical reaction is said to be “in excess”, you assume that you have ''unlimited'' amount of the reactant, and that it will never be the limiting reactant.

[[File:Electrostatic_Potential.jpg|thumb|right]]
'''Water is the most remarkable solvent! The O—H bonds in water are ''polarized'' due to the differences in electronegativity between hydrogen and oxygen. When this uneven charge distribution is coupled with the fact that water has a “bent” molecular geometry, the two covalent bond dipoles combine to form a molecular dipole (shown in the electrostatic potential map on the right. This molecular dipole allows water to surround and stabilize ions in solution, making water a powerful solvent for the dissolution of polar and ionic compounds. If we know the ''amount'' of solute that we have dissolved in a given ''volume'' of solvent, we can define the term molarity, as the ''number of moles of solute in each liter of solution''. Finally, by combining the concept of molarity with what we have learned about simple stoichiometric calculations, we can now approach quantitative chemical calculations in solution.'''

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''7.1 Dipole Moments and the Properties of Water'''==
[[File:Electrostatic_Potential.jpg|thumb|left]] 
Water is an amazing solvent, and has remarkable physical and chemical properties that make it the essential ingredient to life as we know it. The special properties of water come from the fact that the elements hydrogen and oxygen have differing electronegativities. In Chapter 3 we learned that covalent bonds formed between atoms of differing electronegativity are polarized. Because electronegativity is a measure of how strongly a given atom attracts electrons to itself, the atom in the covalent bond with the highest electronegativity will tend to draw the bonding electrons towards itself, resulting in a bond that is electron-rich on one end and electron-poor on the other. Covalent bonds that are polarized are said to have a '''dipole''', where the term '''dipole moment''' refers to the direction and magnitude of the charge separation.

Consider water. The electronegativities of hydrogen and oxygen are 2.20 and 3.44, respectively. That means that in each covalent bond, the electrons will be attracted towards the oxygen, leaving the hydrogen electron-poor. In Chapter 3, we used a calculated electrostatic potential map to visualize the electron density around molecules. The map for water is shown to the left and is colored using red to indicate a high electron density and blue to show electron-poor regions. Because electrons carry a negative charge, this also means that the red regions of the molecule are anionic (negative) and that the blue regions are cationic (positive).

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''7.2 Molecular Dipoles'''==

Electrostatic potential maps are useful because they clearly show the electron distribution around covalent bonds within molecules. They must be calculated, however, using sophisticated computer programs, and then rendered in color for visualization. Because of this, the polarization of covalent bonds is typically shown using a special arrow (a dipole arrow) to indicate the direction in which the bond is polarized. A '''dipole''' '''arrow''' is crossed at the beginning (as in a plus sign) and points in the direction of the greatest electron density. Thus for hydrogen fluoride, the electronegativities are 2.20 and 3.98 for the hydrogen and fluorine, respectively. We would predict that the H—F bond would be polarized with the greatest electron density towards the fluorine. The resulting dipole moment is shown below.

A molecule such as water, with two covalent bonds, will have ''two'' local dipoles, each oriented along the covalent bonds, as shown below. Because water is asymmetric (it has a bend structure) both of these local dipoles point in the same direction, generating a '''molecular dipole''', in which the entire molecule has a charge imbalance, with the “oxygen end” being anionic and the “hydrogen end” being cationic. The predicted molecular dipole is also shown in the electrostatic potential map in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/7.3.html Figure 7.3].

Molecules with local dipoles do not necessarily possess a molecular dipole. Consider the molecule boron trihydride (BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). The BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; molecule is planar with all three hydrogens spaced evenly surrounding the boron (trigonal planar). The electronegativities of boron and hydrogen are 2.04 and 2.20, respectively. The bonds in BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; will therefore be somewhat polarized, with the local dipoles oriented towards the hydrogen atoms, as shown below. But because the molecule is ''symmetrical'', the three dipole arrows cancel and, as a ''molecule'', BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; has no net molecular dipole.

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex7.1.html ''' Exercise 7.1 Drawing Molecular Dipoles ''']

 For each of the molecules shown below indicate whether a molecular dipole exists. If a dipole does exist, &lt;br&gt; use a dipole arrow to indicate the direction of the molecular dipole.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''7.3 Dissolution of Ionic Compounds'''==

A simple ionic compound, such as sodium chloride (NaCl) consists of a sodium cation and a chloride anion. Because these are oppositely charge ions, they are strongly attracted to each other. This attraction is non-specific and the sodium cation would also be strongly attracted to ''any'' anion. When an ionic compound dissolves in water, the individual cations and anions are completely surrounded by water molecules, but these water molecules are not randomly oriented. A sodium cation in water will be surrounded by water molecules oriented so that the negative end of the molecular dipole is in contact with the sodium cation. Likewise, the waters surrounding the chloride anion are oriented so that the positive end of the molecular dipole contacts the anion [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/7.5.html (Figure 7.5)]. When arranged like this, the charged poles of the water molecules ''neutralize'', and thus ''stabilize'' the charges on the ions.

The ability of water to interact with and stabilize charge particles goes well beyond the water molecules that actually touch the ion. Surrounding the inner water shell is another shell of waters that will orient themselves so that their dipoles bind to the exposed dipoles from the inner shell. This is shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/7.6.html Figure 7.6] using drawing showing part of the “cluster” of water molecules surrounding the sodium cation. As the subsequent layers of water surround each other, the positive charge from the cation is ''dispersed'' or spread out over the whole group of interacting molecules. The cluster then becomes effectively ''neutral'' allowing the charged ion to exist free in solution, removed from its counter-ion (the chloride). The dynamic collection of water molecules surrounding an ion in solution is referred to as the '''solvation shell''' and it is the ability of water to solvate and stabilize ions that makes water such an important solvent, both in chemistry and in biology.

In addition to ionic compounds, water will also dissolve and stabilize most molecules that are polar, that is, if they possess a molecular dipole. An example of this is shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/7.7.html Figure 7.7]. The organic compound, methyl propionate, contains a highly polar carbon-oxygen double bond. The electrostatic potential map in the figure clearly shows the resulting molecular dipole and methyl propionate is quite soluble in water; 6.2 grams of methyl propionate will dissolve in 100 mL of water. The organic molecule propane, also shown in the figure, does not possess a significant molecular dipole and is only very slightly soluble in water.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''7.4 Concentration and Molarity'''==

As described in the previous section, sodium chloride is quite soluble in water. At 25 ˚C (about room temperature), 359 grams of sodium chloride will dissolve in one liter of water. If you were to add more sodium chloride to the solution, it would not dissolve, because a given volume of water can only dissolve, disperse and stabilize a fixed amount of solute (the stuff that dissolves). This amount is different for every compound and it depends on the structure of the particular compound and how that structure interacts with the solvation shell. When a substance is dissolved in water to the point that no more will go into solution, we say the solution is '''saturated'''. For most compounds, heating the solution will allow more of the substance to dissolve, hence it is important to note the temperature when you are speaking of the solubility of a particular compound.

If we had a saturated solution of sodium chloride at 25 ˚C, we could quote the concentration as 359 grams/L, but because we know the molar mass of sodium chloride (58.44 grams/mole), we could also express our concentration as: 


&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\left( 3\text{59 g} \right)\times \left( \frac{1\text{ mole}}{\text{58}\text{.44 g}} \right)}{1\text{ L}} \right)=6.14\text{ }{}^{\text{moles}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{L}}\;&lt;/math&gt;

In chemistry, the units of moles/L are called '''molarity''', with the abbreviation M. Thus we could say that our saturated solution of sodium chloride was '''6.14 molar''', or '''6.14 M'''. 

The advantage of expressing concentrations in terms of molarity is that these solutions can now be used in chemical reactions of known stoichiometry because any volume of the solution corresponds directly to a known number of moles of a particular compound. For example, the molar mass of potassium bromide is 119.0 g/mole. If we dissolved 119.0 grams of KBr in 1.000 L of water, the concentration would be 1.000 mole/L, or 1.000 M. If we now took half o this solution (0.500 L) we know that we would also have 0.500 moles of KBr. 

We can determine the concentration of a solution using the problem-solving algorithm we introduced back in Chapter 1. For example, if you wan to find the molarity of a solution containing 42.8 grams of KBr in 1.00 L of water, you would identify the ''given'' and 42.8 g, your ''ratio'' is the molar mass (119 g/mole) and you want to ''find'' molarity (or moles/L). Remembering to set the equation up so that the units of ''given'' appear in the denominator of the ''ratio'', the number of moles is: 


&lt;math&gt;\left( 4\text{2}\text{.8 g} \right)\times \left( \frac{1\text{ mole}}{\text{119 g}} \right)=0.360\text{ moles}&lt;/math&gt;

and, the molarity is: 
&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{0.\text{360 mole}}{\text{1}\text{.00 L}} \right)=0.360\text{ }{}^{\text{moles}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{L}}\;&lt;/math&gt;, or 0.360 M

When you become comfortable with the simple two-step method, you can combine steps and simply divide your given mass by the given volume to get the result directly. Thus, if you had 1.73 grams of KBr in 0.0230 L of water, your concentration would be:

&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\left( 1.\text{73 g} \right)\times \left( \frac{1\text{ mole}}{\text{119 g}} \right)}{0.\text{0230 L}} \right)=0.632\text{ }{}^{\text{moles}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{L}}\;\text{, or, 0}\text{.632 M}&lt;/math&gt;

We can also solve these problems ''backwards,'' that is, convert molarity into mass. For example; determine the number of grams of KBr that are present in 72.5 mL of a 1.05 M solution of KBr. Here we are given a volume of 0.0725 L and our ratio is the molarity, or (1.05 moles/L). We first solve for moles, 


&lt;math&gt;\text{0}\text{.0725 L }\times \text{ }\left( \frac{1.\text{05 mole}}{\text{1}\text{.00 L}} \right)=0.0761\text{ moles}&lt;/math&gt;

and then convert to mass using: 
&lt;math&gt;\text{0}\text{.0761 moles }\times \text{ }\left( \frac{1\text{19 grams}}{\text{1 mole}} \right)=9.06\text{ grams of KBr}&lt;/math&gt;.

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp7.1.html '''Example 7.1 Molarity Calculations''']

 A sample of 12.7 grams of sodium sulfate (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is dissolved in 672 mL of distilled water. &lt;br&gt; a. What is the molar concentration of sodium sulfate in the solution? &lt;br&gt; b. What is the concentration of sodium ion in the solution?

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex7.2.html '''Exercise 7.2 Molarity Calculations ''']

 Calculate the mass of sodium chloride required to make 125.0 mL of a 0.470 M NaCl solution.
 If you dissolve 5.8g of NaCl in water and then dilute to a total of 100.0 mL, what will be &lt;br&gt; the molar concentration of the resulting sodium chloride solution?

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''7.5 Solution Stoichiometry'''==

As we learned in Chapter 5, double replacement reactions involve the reaction between ionic compounds in solution and, in the course of the reaction, the ions in the two reacting compounds are “switched” (they ''replace'' each other). As an example, silver nitrate and sodium chloride react to form sodium nitrate and the ''insoluble'' compound, silver chloride.

&lt;center&gt;AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq) ''+ NaCl'' (aq)'' &amp;rarr; AgCl'' (s)'' + NaNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)''&lt;/center&gt;


Because these reactions occur in aqueous solution, we can use the concept of molarity to directly calculate the number of moles of products that will be formed, and hence the mass of precipitates. In the reaction shown above, if we mixed 123 mL of a 1.00 M solution of NaCl with 72.5 mL of a 2.71 M solution of AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, we could calculate the moles (and hence, the mass) of AgCl that will be formed as follows:

First, we must examine the reaction stoichiometry. In this reaction, one mole of AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with one mole of NaCl to give one mole of AgCl. Because our ratios are one, we don’t need to include them in the equation. Next, we need to calculate the number of moles of each reactant:


&lt;math&gt;\text{0}\text{.123 L }\times \text{ }\left( \frac{1.\text{00 mole}}{\text{1}\text{.00 L}} \right)=0.123\text{ moles NaCl}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\text{0}\text{.0725 L }\times \text{ }\left( \frac{2.\text{71 mole}}{\text{1}\text{.00 L}} \right)=0.196\text{ moles AgNO}_{\text{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

Because this is a ''limiting reactant'' problem, we need to recall that the moles of product that can be formed will equal the ''smaller'' of the number of moles of the two reactants. In this case, NaCl is limiting and AgNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is in excess. Because our stoichiometry is one-to-one, we will therefore form 0.123 moles of AgCl. Finally, we can convert this to mass using the molar mass of AgCl:


&lt;math&gt;\text{0}\text{.0725 L }\times \text{ }\left( \frac{2.\text{71 mole}}{\text{1}\text{.00 L}} \right)=0.196\text{ moles AgNO}_{\text{3}}&lt;/math&gt;

In a reaction where the stoichiometry is not one-to-one, you simply need to include the stoichiometric ratio in you equations. Thus, for the reaction between lead (II) nitrate and potassium iodide, two moles of potassium iodide are required for every mole of lead (II) iodide that is formed.

&lt;center&gt;Pb(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)'' + 2 KI ''(aq)'' &amp;rarr; PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(s)'' + 2 KNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)''&lt;/center&gt;


For example: 1.78 grams of lead (II) nitrate are dissolved in 17.0 mL of water and then mixed with 25.0 mL of 2.5 M potassium iodide solution. What ''mass'' of lead (II) iodide will be formed and what will be the ''final concentration'' of potassium nitrate in the solution? Again, we need to look at this as a limiting reactant problem and first calculate the number of moles of each reactant:


&lt;math&gt;\text{1}\text{.78 g}\times \left( \frac{1.\text{00 mole}}{\text{331}\text{.2 g}} \right)=5.37\times \text{10}^{\text{-3}}\text{ moles Pb(NO}_{\text{3}}\text{)}_{\text{2}}&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\text{0}\text{.0025 L }\times \text{ }\left( \frac{2.\text{50 mole}}{\text{1 L}} \right)=6.25\times \text{10}^{\text{-3}}\text{ moles KI}&lt;/math&gt;

The stoichiometry of this reaction is given by the ratios 
&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\text{1 mole PbI}_{\text{2}}}{2\text{ mole KI}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, and 
&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{1\text{ mole PbI}_{\text{2}}}{\text{1 mole Pb(NO}_{\text{3}}\text{)}_{\text{2}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, so the number of moles of product that would be formed from each reactant is calculated as:


&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{1\text{ mole PbI}_{\text{2}}}{\text{1 mole Pb(NO}_{\text{3}}\text{)}_{\text{2}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;6.25\times \text{10}^{\text{-3}}\text{ moles KI}\times \text{ }\left( \frac{1\text{ mole PbI}_{\text{2}}}{\text{2 moles KI}} \right)=3.12\times \text{10}^{\text{-3}}\text{ moles PbI}_{\text{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Potassium iodide produces the smaller amount of PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and hence, is ''limiting'' and lead (II) nitrate is in ''excess''. The mass of lead (II) iodide that will be produced is then calculated from the number of moles and the molar mass:


&lt;math&gt;\text{3}\text{.12}\times \text{10}^{\text{-3}}\text{ moles }\times \text{ }\left( \frac{4\text{61 grams}}{\text{1 mole}} \right)=1.44\text{ grams of PbI}_{\text{2}}&lt;/math&gt;

To determine the concentration of potassium nitrate in the final solution, we need to note that two moles of potassium nitrate are formed for every mole of PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or a stoichiometric ratio of 
&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{2\text{ moles KNO}_{\text{3}}}{\text{1 mole PbI}_{\text{2}}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;. Our final volume is (17.0 + 25.0) = 42.0 mL, and the concentration of potassium nitrate is calculated as:


&lt;math&gt;\frac{3.12\times \text{10}^{\text{-3}}\text{ moles PbI}_{\text{2}}\times \text{ }\left( \frac{2\text{ mole KNO}_{\text{3}}}{\text{1 mole PbI}_{\text{2}}} \right)}{0.0420\text{ L}}={}^{0.148\text{ moles KNO}_{\text{3}}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{L}}\;\text{, or, 0}\text{.148 M}&lt;/math&gt;

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''7.6 Dilution of Concentrated Solutions'''==

In the laboratory, a chemist will often prepare solutions of known concentration beginning with a standard stock solution. A stock solution is generally concentrated and, of course, the molar concentration of the solute must be known. To perform a reaction, a measured amount of this stock solution will be withdrawn and added to another reactant, or will be diluted into a larger volume for some other use. The calculations involved in these dilutions are trivial and simply involve calculating the number of moles transferred and dividing this by the final volume. For example, 15.0 mL of a stock solution of 1.00 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) is withdrawn and diluted into 75 mL of distilled water; what is the final concentration of hydrochloric acid? 

First, the number of moles of HCl is calculated from the volume added and the concentration of the stock solution:


&lt;math&gt;\text{0}\text{.0150 L}\times \left( \frac{\text{1}\text{.00 moles}}{\text{1 L}} \right)=0.0150\text{ moles Hcl}&lt;/math&gt;

We have diluted this number of moles into (15.0 + 75.0) = 90.0 mL, therefore the final concentration of HCl is given by:


&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{0.0150\text{ moles HCl}}{\text{0}\text{.0900 L}} \right)=\left( {}^{\text{0}\text{.167 moles HCl}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{L}}\; \right)\text{, or 0}\text{.167 M}&lt;/math&gt;

An even simpler way to approach these problems is to multiply the initial concentration of the stock solution by the ''ratio'' of the aliquot (the amount withdrawn from the stock solution) to the final volume, using Equation 7.1,


&lt;math&gt;\left( \text{stock concentration} \right)\times \left( \frac{\text{volume of the aliquot}}{\text{final volume}} \right)=\text{final concentration}&lt;/math&gt;
Eq 7.1

Using this method on the previous problem,


&lt;math&gt;\left( \text{1}\text{.00 M} \right)\times \left( \frac{\text{15}\text{.0 mL}}{\text{90}\text{.0 mL}} \right)=\text{0}.167\text{ M}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that we did not have to convert our volumes (15.0 and 90.0 mL) into L when we use this approach because the units of volume cancel in the equation. If the units that are given for the aliquot and the final volume are different, a metric conversion ratio may be required. For example, 10.0 µL of a 1.76 M solution of HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (nitric acid) are diluted into 10.0 mL of distilled water; what is the final concentration of nitric acid?

In this problem, we need to convert µL and mL into a common unit. We can do this using the ratios, 
&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{10^{-6}\text{ L}}{\text{1 }\mu \text{L}} \right)\text{ and }\left( \frac{10^{-3}\text{ L}}{\text{1 mL}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;. We need to multiply each of our volumes by the appropriate factor to get our volumes in terms of liters, and then simply multiply by the initial concentration. Thus,


&lt;math&gt;1.76\text{ M}\times \left\{ \frac{10.0\text{ }\mu \text{L}\left( \frac{10^{-6}\text{ L}}{\text{1 }\mu \text{L}} \right)}{10.0\text{ mL}\left( \frac{10^{-3}\text{ L}}{\text{1 mL}} \right)} \right\}=1.76\times 10^{-3}\text{ M}&lt;/math&gt;

The final volume in this problem is actually (1.00  10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; L) + (1.00  10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; L) = 1.001  10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; L, but because our calculation is only accurate to three significant figures, the volume of the aliquot is not significant and the final volume has been rounded. 

The standard method we have used here can also be adapted to the type of problem in which you need to find the volume of a stock solution that must be diluted to a certain volume in order to produce a solution of a given'' ''concentration. For example, what volume of 0.029 M CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must be diluted to exactly 0.500 L in order to give a solution that is 50.0 µM?

In order to solve this problem in the simplest of terms, we should re-examine Equation 7.1. 


&lt;math&gt;\left( \text{stock concentration} \right)\times \left( \frac{\text{volume of the aliquot}}{\text{final volume}} \right)=\text{final concentration}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation can be re-written as:


&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\text{volume of the aliquot}}{\text{final volume}} \right)=\left( \frac{\text{final concentration}}{\text{stock concentration}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;, or, 
&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{V}{V_{f}} \right)=\left( \frac{C_{f}}{C_{i}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


where ''C&lt;sub&gt;i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C&lt;sub&gt;f''&lt;/sub&gt; are the ''stock'' and ''final'' concentrations, respectively, ''V'' is the volume of the aliquot and ''V&lt;sub&gt;f''&lt;/sub&gt; is the final volume of the solution. Stated another way, this is simply a set of ratios; ''aliquot'' to ''final volume'', and ''final concentration'' to ''initial concentration ''(operationally, these ratios will always be “''small value/larger value''”). Working with this set of ratios, we can directly solve this type of problem as follows:

First, we need to convert our final concentration (50.0 µM) into M, to match the units of our stock solution. The metric multiplier for µ is 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt;, making our final concentration 50.0  10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; M, or more properly, 5.00  10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; M. Our equation is therefore:


&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{V}{0.500\text{ L}} \right)=\left( \frac{5.00\times 10^{-5}\text{ M}}{0.029\text{ M}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;center&gt;, or, 
&lt;math&gt;V=\left( \frac{5.00\times 10^{-5}\text{ M}}{0.029\text{ M}} \right)\times 0.500\text{ L}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


The volume of the aliquot, ''V'', is 8.62  10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; L, or using the conversion factor 
&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\text{10}^{\text{3}}\text{ mL}}{\text{1 L}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, the required volume is 0.86 mL (there are only two significant figures in the concentration of the stock solution, 0.029 M). 

Dilution problems can be solved directly using Equation 7.1, or, as you become more comfortable with the math, using the initial and final ratios like we did in this problem (remember, the numbers in the two ratios are ''“smaller/larger”'').

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp7.3.html '''Example 7.3 Serial Dilutions ''']

 A 1.50 mL aliquot of a 0.177 M solution of sulfuric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is diluted into 10.0 mL of distilled water, &lt;br&gt; to give solution '''A'''. A 10.0 mL aliquot of '''A''' is then diluted into 50.0 mL of distilled water, to give &lt;br&gt; solution '''B'''.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''''Study Points'''''==
* Covalent bonds formed between atoms of differing electronegativity are ''polarized'', resulting in a bond that is electron-rich on one end and electron-poor on the other. Covalent bonds that are polarized are said to have a '''dipole''', where the term '''dipole moment''' refers to the direction and magnitude of the charge separation. 
* If a molecule is ''asymmetric'' (such as a molecule with a bend structure) local dipoles along covalent bonds can combine, generating a '''molecular dipole''', in which the entire molecule has an imbalance with regard to electron distribution. This can be shown with an dipole arrow (with a positive end) indicating the direction of the charge separation in the molecule.
* If a molecule is symmetrical (such as BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, which is trigonal planar), the individual dipoles associated with the covalent bonds cancel, leaving a molecule with no molecular dipole.
* Water has a significant molecular dipole, allowing it to strongly interact with other polar molecules and with individual ions from ionic compounds. Because of this, water is able to break the electrostatic attraction between ions in compounds and to move the ions into solution. In solution, cations will be surrounded by a '''solvation shell''' where the water molecules are oriented so that the ''negative'' end of the water molecule interacts with the ''cation''. Likewise, the ''cationic'' end of water will surround and solvate ''anions''.
* '''Molarity''' is simply defined as the ''number of moles of a solute'' dissolved in ''one liter of solvent'', or &lt;math&gt;\left( {}^{moles}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{L}\; \right)&lt;/math&gt;. The abbreviation for molarity is the '''uppercase M'''.
* You should remember that '''concentration''' multiplied by '''volume''' gives the number of '''moles''' of solute; &lt;math&gt;\left( {}^{moles}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{L}\; \right)\times L=moles&lt;/math&gt;.
* When you are given the amount of solute in grams, remember, '''mass''' divided by '''molar mass''' gives '''moles'''. Dividing this by '''volume''' (in liters) gives '''molarity'''; &lt;math&gt;\frac{\left( \frac{grams}{{}^{grams}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{mole}\;} \right)}{L}=molarity&lt;/math&gt;.
* In a '''standard solution''', we simply know the ''molarity'' of the solute(s). Because ''concentration'' (the molarity) multiplied by ''volume'' gives us ''moles'', we can calculate the number of moles in given volume and use this value in standard stoichiometric calculations.
* A sample of a solution of known volume is called an aliquot. When an aliquot of a solution is diluted into a larger volume, the final concentration can be calculated as:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\text{volume of the aliquot}}{\text{final volume}} \right)=\left( \frac{\text{final concentration}}{\text{stock concentration}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
, or, 
&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{V}{V_{f}} \right)=\left( \frac{C_{f}}{C_{i}} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

where ''C&lt;sub&gt;i''&lt;/sub&gt; and ''C&lt;sub&gt;f''&lt;/sub&gt; are the ''stock'' and ''final'' concentrations, respectively, ''V'' is the volume of the aliquot and ''V&lt;sub&gt;f''&lt;/sub&gt; is the final volume of the solution. This relationship is also often stated as V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where the subscripts refer to the initial and final concentrations and volumes.

'''We have all heard of '''acids'''… ''acid indigestion'', the acid content of ''vinegars'' and ''cheap wines'', vats of ''sulfuric acid'' and arch villains. In the last chapter we learned about the molecular dipole in water and how water molecules form hydrogen bonds among themselves, and to other polar molecules. In this chapter we will see that this hydrogen bonding can be strong enough to actually break the O—H bonds in water and in other hydrogen bonded molecules, transferring the proton to water to form the '''hydronium ion''', H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. In its simplest sense, the formation of the hydronium ion is the “acidity” that we are all familiar with. We will see how we measure this acidity (the '''pH scale'''). We will get an introduction to the concept of '''equilibrium''' and you will finally come to appreciate the utility of the ''log'' and ''anti-log'' buttons on your scientific calculator!'''

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''8.1 Hydrogen Bonding'''==
In Chapter 7, we explored the unique properties of water that allow it to serve as a powerful solvent with the ability to dissolve both ionic compounds, as well as polar molecular compounds. We attributed this to the ability of water molecules to align themselves so that the polarized hydrogen-oxygen bonds could stabilize cations, anions, and virtually any compound that also contained a significantly polarized covalent bond. By this logic, it is not at all surprising that water can also react strongly with itself, and indeed water exists as a vast network of molecules aligned so that their positive and negative dipoles interact with each other. This is shown in the drawing in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/8.1.html  Figure 8.1], and the dotted lines indicate interactions between hydrogens (the ''positive'' end of the molecular dipole) and oxygens (the ''negative'' end of the dipole). A bond that is formed from a hydrogen atom, which is part of a polar covalent bond (such as the O—H bond) to another, more electronegative atom (that has at least one unshared pair of electrons in its valence shell) is called a '''hydrogen bond'''. Recall that oxygen has two unshared pairs in its valence shell, and the hydrogen-oxygen interaction in water is the classic example of a hydrogen bond. Hydrogen bonds are weak, relative to covalent bonds. The energy required to break the O—H covalent bond (the '''bond dissociation energy''') is about 111 kcal/mole, or in more proper ''SI'' units, 464 kJ/mole. The energy required to break an O—H••••O hydrogen bond is about 5 kcal/mole (21 kJ/mole), or less than 5% of the energy of a “real” covalent bond. Even though hydrogen bonds are relatively weak, if you consider that every water molecule is participating in a least four hydrogen bonds, the total energy of hydrogen bonding interactions can rapidly become significant. Hydrogen bonding is generally used to explain the high boiling point of water (100 ˚C). For many compounds which do not possess highly polarized bonds, boiling points parallel the molar mass of the compound. Methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, has a molar mass of 16 and a boiling point of –164 ˚C. Water, with a molar mass of 18, has a boiling point of +100 ˚C. Although these two compounds have similar molar masses, a significant amount of energy must be put into the polar molecule, water, in order to move into the gas phase, relative to the non-polar methane. The extra energy that is required is necessary to break down the hydrogen bonding network.

Hydrogen bonding is also important is DNA. According to the Watson-Crick model, the double helix of DNA is assembled and stabilized by hydrogen pairing between matching “bases”. In [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/8.2.html  Figure 8.2], the hydrogen bonds between adenine and thymidine are shown as the faint dotted lines. The hydrogen bonds are formed between the oxygen atoms (red) and the adjacent N—H bonds, and between the central nitrogen (blue) and the adjacent N—H bond. It is suggested that the precise alignment of these hydrogen bonds contributes to stability of the double helix and ensures the proper alignment of the corresponding base pairs.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''8.2 Ionization of Acids in Solution'''==

In general, acids can be thought of as molecular compounds containing at least one hydrogen which is covalently bonded to a more electronegative atom. As an example, consider the compound hydrogen fluoride (HF). As we discussed in Chapter 7, the electronegativities of hydrogen and fluorine are 2.1 and 4.0, respectively, and the hydrogen-fluoride covalent bond is very highly polarized, as shown in the electrostatic potential map shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/8.3.html  Figure 8.3].


Because of this, when hydrogen fluoride is dissolved in water, water molecules orient themselves around HF so that the water dipoles interact with, and stabilize, the highly polarized H—F bond. Important to this stabilization is the hydrogen bond that is formed between the hydrogen of HF and the oxygen of an adjacent water. This hydrogen bond not only stabilizes the HF molecular dipole, but it also ''weakens ''the H—F covalent bond. As a result of this weakening, the H—F bond stretches (the bond length increases) and then fully breaks. The hydrogen that was hydrogen-bonded to the water molecule now becomes ''fully'' bonded to the oxygen, forming the species H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (the '''hydronium ion''') and the fluorine now exists as a fluoride anion. This is known as the process of '''acid dissociation''' and the steps in this process are shown using “ball and stick” molecular models in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/8.4.html  Figure 8.4].


The chemical equation describing the acid dissociation reaction of HF is given in Equation 8.1'''a'''. The products of the reaction, fluoride anion and the hydronium ion, are oppositely charged ions, and it is reasonable to assume that they will be attracted to each other. If they ''do'' come in contact, it is also reasonable to suggest that the process of hydrogen transfer that we described above can also happen ''in reverse.'' That is, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can hydrogen bond to the fluoride ion and the hydrogen can be transferred back, to form HF and water. The chemical equation describing this process is shown in Equation 8.1'''b'''. In fact, these two reaction do occur simultaneously (and very rapidly) in solution. When we speak of a set of forward- and back-reactions that occur together on a ''very fast'' time-scale, we describe the set of reactions as an '''equilibrium''' and we use a special double arrow in the chemical reaction to show this (Equation 8.1'''c'''). Equation 8.1'''c''' can be said to represent the ''equilibrium dissociation of HF in water.''


HF ''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  &amp;rarr;  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq)'' + F&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq)''Eq. 8.1a

HF ''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&amp;larr;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq)'' + F&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq)''Eq. 8.1b

HF ''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  &amp;#8644;   H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq)'' + F&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq) ''Eq. 8.1c

For any equilibrium, an '''equilibrium constant''' can be written that describes whether the ''products'' or the ''reactants'' will be the predominant species in solution. We will address this fully in Chapter 10, but according to the ''Law of Mass Action'', the equilibrium constant, ''K'' for this reaction, is simply given by the ratio of the concentrations of the products and the reactants (concentrations from each side are multiplied together if there is more than one). Note that '''any solid or liquid reactants or products''' (such as water) are not included in the expression. Thus for the ionization of HF;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K_{a}=\frac{\left[ \text{H}_{\text{3}}\text{O}^{+} \right]\left[ \text{F}^{-} \right]}{\left[ \text{HF} \right]}&lt;/math&gt;
.&lt;/center&gt;


When you are dealing with acids, the equilibrium constant is generally called an '''acid''' '''dissociation constant''', and is written as ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. The larger the value of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, the greater the extent of ionization and the and the higher the resulting concentration of the hydronium ion. Because the concentration of the hydronium ion is directly correlated with acidity, acids with a large value of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; are termed '''strong acids'''. We will introduce “weak acids” in Chapter 10, but for now the important thing to remember is that strong acids are virtually 100% ionized in solution. That doesn’t mean that the back-reaction does not occur, is simply means that much more favorable and that 99.9999999999% of the acid is present in its ionized form. Because this exceeds the number of significant figures that we typically work with, strong acids are generally described as 100% ionized in solution. Table 8.1 lists the common strong acids that we will study in this text.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''8.3 Conjugate Acid-Base Pairs'''==

Acid dissociation reactions are often described in terms of the concepts of conjugate acids and their corresponding conjugate bases. The description of “acids and bases” that we will deal with in this text will be limited to simple dissociation reactions, like those shown above, where a hydronium ion is produced. This description is referred to as the '''Brønsted-Lowery Acid-Base Theory''', and in the Brønsted theory, the '''conjugate acid''' is defined as the species that ''donates'' a hydrogen in the forward reaction, and the '''conjugate base''' is the species that ''accepts'' a hydrogen the reverse reaction. Thus for the ionization of HCl, HCl is the conjugate acid and Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; is the conjugate base.

HCl ''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  &amp;#8644;  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq)'' + Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq) ''

In the discussion of Brønsted acid-base behavior, the hydrogen atom that is transferred is generally referred to as a '''proton''', because it is transferred as a hydrogen atom without its electron. Thus for the ionization of HCl, HCl (the conjugate acid) is a ''proton donor'' and Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; (the conjugate base) is a ''proton acceptor.'' In General Chemistry you will learn that acid-base behavior can also be described in terms of electron donors and electron acceptors (the '''Lewis Acid-Base Theory''' in which an ''acid'' is an electron acceptor and a ''base'' is an electron donor), but here we will limit our discussion to simple, strong, Brønsted acids and bases.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''8.4 Acids-Bases Reactions: Neutralization'''==

In Chapter 5, we examined a special case of a double replacement reaction in which an acid reacted with a base to give water and a pair of ions in solution. In the context of the Brønsted Theory, a base can be thought of as an ionic compound that produces the hydroxide anion in solution. Thus, sodium hydroxide, NaOH, ionizes to form the sodium cation and the hydroxide anion (HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;).

NaOH ''(aq)''  &amp;rarr;  Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq)'' + HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq) ''

We have written this equation using a single arrow because sodium hydroxide is a ''strong base'' and is essentially 100% ionized in solution. The hydroxide anion (HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) reacts with the hydronium ion (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) to form ''two'' moles of water, as shown in the equation given below.

H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;  &amp;rarr;  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O 

Thus, if you have aqueous solutions of HCl and NaOH, the following process occur:

*HCl ionizes to form the hydronium ion: 

HCl ''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  &amp;#8644;   H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq)'' + Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq)''

*NaOH ionizes to form the hydroxide anion: 

NaOH ''(aq)''   &amp;rarr;   Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq)'' + HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq)''

*HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; reacts with H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to form ''two'' moles of water: 

H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;'' ''+ HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;   &amp;rarr;   2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O 


If we add up the set of three equations, we see that hydronium and hydroxide ions appear on both sides of the arrow and cancel, leaving:

HCl ''(aq)'' + NaOH ''(aq)''   &amp;rarr;   H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + NaCl ''(aq)''


In this equation, we have not shown the additional water from the hydronium ion and we have grouped the sodium and chloride ions as NaCl ''(aq)'', with the understanding that it will be fully ionized in aqueous solution. This is an example of a ''neutralization'' reaction; an ''acid'' and a ''base'' have reacted to form ''water''. When we write neutralization equations we generally do not show hydronium or hydroxide ions and we generally show ionic species as distinct compounds. Neutralization equations therefore look very much like the other double replacements that we studied in Chapter 5.

For each of the following, write a balanced neutralization equation:

 a.The reaction of calcium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid.'' ''

 b.The reaction of sodium hydroxide with sulfuric acid (both ionizations). 

 c.The reaction of barium hydroxide with nitric acid. 

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex8.2.html ''' Exercise 8.2 Writing and Balancing Neutralization Equations ''']

 Write a balanced neutralization equation for the reaction of calcium hydroxide&lt;br&gt; with sulfuric acid.


== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''8.5 The Meaning of ''Neutrality'': The Autoprotolysis of Water'''==

In the previous section, we described the reaction of an acid and a base to form water. When all of the acid and base have been consumed, we are left with water and an aqueous solution containing an ionic compound. Another way to think of this would be to say that, the acid we began with had a high concentration of hydronium cations (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), the base had a high concentration of hydroxide anions (HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;) and the neutral solution contains only water. This, however, is a little too simplistic. Just like water can promote the ionization of acids, water can also promote the ionization of ''itself''. Picture two water molecules sharing a hydrogen bond. Just like we saw in Figure 8.4 for HF , the partially bonded hydrogen can transfer ''along'' the hydrogen bond to form a hydronium cation and a hydroxide anion ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/8.5.html  Figure 8.5]). This process occurs very rapidly in pure water, thus, any sample of pure water will ''always ''contain a small concentration of hydronium and hydroxide ions. How small is “small”? Very small! In pure water at 25 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, the concentration of hydronium ions ([H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]) and hydroxide ions ([HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]) will both be equal to exactly 1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; M. Based on this, we can expand upon our definitions of acidic, basic and neutral solutions:

* A solution is '''acidic''' if [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] &gt; 1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; M. 
* A solution is '''basic''' if [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] &lt; 1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; M. 
* A solution is '''neutral''' if [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; M. 

Working with these definitions, if you have a solution with [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 4.5 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; M, it will be ''acidic'' (4.5 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;)''.'' If you have a solution with [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; M, it will be ''basic'' (1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; &lt; 1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;). Finally, a ''neutral'' solution is one in which [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and [HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;] are ''both'' 1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; M. 

Recalling our discussion of acid dissociation constants from Section 8.2, we can write the ionization equilibrium for water and the expression for the dissociation constant, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, as shown below:

&lt;center&gt;2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O    &amp;#8644;    H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; ''and'' [
&lt;math&gt;K_{a}=\frac{\left[ \text{H}_{\text{3}}\text{O}^{+} \right]\left[ \text{HO}^{-} \right]}{\left[ \text{H}_{\text{2}}\text{O} \right]^{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Because the molar concentration of water (in pure water) is 55.5 M, the term for [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O] is essentially a constant and can be neglected (recall the law of mass action). When we do this, we call the dissociation constant ''K''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as 
&lt;math&gt;K_{W}=\left[ \text{H}_{\text{3}}\text{O}^{+} \right]\left[ \text{HO}^{-} \right]&lt;/math&gt;. At neutrality and 25 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and [HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;] are ''both'' 1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; M, therefore:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K_{W}=\left[ 1\times 10^{-7} \right]\left[ 1\times 10^{-7} \right]=1\times 10^{-14}&lt;/math&gt;
.&lt;/center&gt;

This simple relationship is actually quite powerful. Because ''K''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; is a constant, if we know ''either'' a hydronium ion or a hydroxide ion concentration, we can directly calculate the concentration of the other species. For example, if you are ''given'' that [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] is 1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; M, [HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;] can be calculated as:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K_{W}=\left[ \text{H}_{\text{3}}\text{O}^{+} \right]\left[ \text{HO}^{-} \right]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K_{W}=1\times 10^{-14}=\left[ 1\times 10^{-4} \right]\left[ \text{HO}^{-} \right]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left[ \text{HO}^{-} \right]=\frac{\text{1}\times \text{10}^{-\text{14}}}{\text{1}\times \text{10}^{-\text{4}}}=1\times 10^{-10}\text{M}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''8.6 ''p''H Calculations'''==

One thing that you should notice about the numbers in the previous examples is that they are ''very small''. In general, chemists find that working with large negative exponents like these (very small numbers) is cumbersome. To simplify the process, calculations involving hydronium ion concentrations are generally done using ''logarithms''. Recall that a '''logarithm''' is simply the exponent that some base number needs to be raised to in order to generate a given number. In these calculations, we will use a base of 10. A number such as 10,000 can be written as 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, so by the definition, the logarithm of 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; is simply 4. For a small number such as 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;, the logarithm is again simply the exponent, or -7. Before calculators became readily available, taking the logarithm of a number that was ''not'' an integral power of 10 meant a trip to “log tables” (or even worse, using a slide rule). Now, pushing the LOG button on an a scientific calculator makes the process trivial. For example, the logarithm of 14,283 (with the push of a button) is 4.15482. If you are paying attention, you should have noticed that the logarithm contains ''six'' digits, while the original number (14,283) only contains ''five'' significant figures. This is because a logarithm consists of two sets of numbers; the digits to the left of the decimal point (called the '''characteristic''') simply reflect the integral power of 10, and are ''not included'' when you count significant figures. The numbers ''after'' the decimal (the '''mantissa''') should have the same significance as your experimental number, thus a logarithm of 4.15482 actually represents ''five'' significant figures.

There is one other convention that chemists apply when they are dealing with logarithms of hydronium ion concentrations, that is, the logarithm is multiplied by (-1) to change its sign. Why would we do this? In most aqueous solutions, [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] will vary between 10&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 10&lt;sup&gt;-13&lt;/sup&gt; M, giving logarithms of –1 to –13. To make these numbers easier to work with, we take the ''negative'' of the logarithm (-log[H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]) and call it a '''''p''H''' value. The use of the lower-case “''p''” reminds us that we have taken the ''negative'' of the logarithm, and the upper-case “H” tells us that we are referring to the ''hydronium ion concentration.'' Converting a hydronium ion concentration to a ''p''H value is simple. Suppose you have a solution where [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 3.46 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; M and you want to know the corresponding ''p''H value. You would enter 3.46 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4 &lt;/sup&gt;into your calculator and press the LOG button. The display should read “-3.460923901”. First, we multiply this by (-1) and get 3.460923901. Next, we examine the number of significant figures. Our experimental number, 3.46 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; has three significant figures, so our mantissa must have three digits. We round our answer and express our result as, ''p''H = 3.461.

The reverse process is equally simple. If you are given a ''p''H value of 7.04 and are asked to calculate a hydronium ion concentration, you would first multiply the ''p''H value by (-1) to give –7.04. Enter this in your calculator and then press the key (or key combination) to calculate “10&lt;sup&gt;x&lt;/sup&gt;”; your display should read “9.120108 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;–8&lt;/sup&gt;”. There are only two digits in our original mantissa (7.'''04''') so we must round this to ''two'' significant figures, or [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 9.1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt;.

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp8.4.html ''' Example 8.4] Calculating [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and pH Values '''

 a. A solution is known to have a hydronium ion concentration of 4.5 &amp;times;&lt;br&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; M; what is the ''p''H this solution?

 b. A solution is known to have a ''p''H of 9.553; what is the concentration of&lt;br&gt; hydronium ion in this solution?

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex8.4.html ''' Exercise 8.4] Calculating [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and pH Values '''

 a. A solution is known to have a hydronium ion concentration of 9.5 &amp;times;&lt;br&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt; M; what is the ''p''H this solution?

 b. A solution is known to have a pH of 4.57; what is the hydronium ion&lt;br&gt; concentration of this solution?


There is another useful calculation that we can do by combining what we know about ''p''H and expression 
&lt;math&gt;K_{W}=\left[ \text{H}_{\text{3}}\text{O}^{+} \right]\left[ \text{HO}^{-} \right]&lt;/math&gt;. We know that ''K''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;-14&lt;/sup&gt; and we know that (-log [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]) is ''p''H. If we define (-log [HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]) as ''p''OH, we can take our expression for ''K''&lt;sub&gt;W&lt;/sub&gt; and take the (-log) of both sides (remember, algebraically you can perform the same operation on both sides of an equation) we get:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K_{W}=10^{-14}=\left[ \text{H}_{\text{3}}\text{O}^{+} \right]\left[ \text{HO}^{-} \right]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;-\log \left( 10^{-14} \right)=\left( -\log \left[ \text{H}_{\text{3}}\text{O}^{+} \right] \right)+\left( -\log \left[ \text{HO}^{-} \right] \right)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;14=p\text{H}+p\text{OH}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Which tells us that the values of ''p''H and ''p''OH must always add up to give 14! Thus, if the ''p''H is 3.5, the ''p''OH must be 14 – 3.5 = 11.5. This relationship is quite useful as it allows you to quickly convert between ''p''H and ''p''OH, and therefore between [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and [HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;].

We can now re-address ''neutrality'' in terms of the ''p''H scale:

* A solution is '''acidic''' if ''p''H &lt; 7. 
* A solution is '''basic''' if ''p''H &gt; 7. 
* A solution is '''neutral''' if ''p''H = 7. 

The simplest way to determine the ''p''H of a solution is to use an electronic ''p''H meter ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/8.6.html  Figure 8.6]). A ''p''H meter is actually a sensitive millivolt meter that measures the potential across a thin, sensitive glass electrode that is immersed in the solution. The voltage that develops is a direct function of the ''p''H of the solution and the circuitry is calibrated so that the voltage is directly converted into the equivalent of a ''p''H value. You will most likely use a simple ''p''H meter in the laboratory. The thing to remember is that the sensing electrode has a very thin, fragile, glass membrane and is somewhat expensive to replace. Be careful!

A simple way to estimate the ''p''H of a solution is by using an ''indicator.'' A''' ''p''H'' ''indicator''' is a compound that undergoes a change in color at a certain ''p''H value''.'' For example, phenolphthalein ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/8.7.html  Figure 8.7]) is a commonly used indicator that is ''colorless'' at ''p''H values below 9, but is ''pink'' at ''p''H 10 and above (at very high ''p''H it becomes colorless again). In the laboratory, a small amount of phenolphthalein is added to a solution at low ''p''H and then a base is slowly added to achieve neutrality. When the phenolphthalein changes from colorless to pink, you know that enough base has been added to neutralize all of the acid that is present. In reality, the transition occurs at ''p''H 9.2, not ''p''H 7, so the resulting solution is actually slightly alkaline, but the additional hydroxide ion concentration at pH 9 (10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; M) is generally insignificant relative to the concentrations of the solutions being tested.

A convenient way to estimate the ''p''H of a solution is to use ''p''H paper. This is simply a strip of paper that has a mixture of indicators embedded in it. The indicators are chosen so that the paper takes on a slightly different color over a range of ''p''H values. The simplest ''p''H paper is ''litmus paper'' that changes from pink to blue as a solution goes from acid to base. Other ''p''H papers are more exotic. [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/8.8.html  Figure 8.8] shows a common commercial ''p''H paper that changes colors gradually over a ''p''H range of 1 to 12. In the laboratory, you will use both indicators, like phenolphthalein, and ''p''H papers in neutralization experiments called ''titrations'', as described in the following section.


== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''8.7 Titrations: Neutralization and Stoichiometry'''==

One of the standard laboratory exercises in General Chemistry is an '''acid-base''' '''titration'''. In order to perform an acid-base titration, you must have a solution of acid or base with a known concentration. You then slowly add a known volume of this solution, using a volumetric '''burette''', to an acid or base solution with an ''unknown'' concentration until neutrality has been achieved. At that point, you know the volume and concentration of the reactant you have added, which means that you can calculate the number of ''moles'' that you added. Based on the stoichiometry of your neutralization reaction, you then know how many moles of acid or base were in the unknown sample. How do you know when you have reached neutrality? Generally an indicator or a ''p''H meter is used (as described in Section 8.5). For example, if we had a solution of NaOH that was exactly 0.100 M and we had a beaker containing an ''unknown'' concentration of HCl. To perform the titration we would add a few drops of a stock phenolphthalein solution to our HCl, and then slowly add a measured amount of the NaOH solution until all of the acid had been consumed and the indicator changed from colorless to pink [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/8.9.html  (Figure 8.9)].


&lt;center&gt;HCl ''(aq)'' + NaOH ''(aq)''   &amp;rarr;   NaCl ''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/center&gt;

Working with the above example, if the volume of base that we added (as measured on the buret) was 12.6 mL, we could calculate the number of moles present in the unknown acid solution. This is equal to the known concentration of our NaOH (0.100 M) multiplied by the volume required for neutrality (0.0126 L), or:


&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left( 0.100\text{ }{}^{\text{moles}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\text{L}}\; \right)\left( 0.0126\text{ L} \right)=\text{1}\text{.26}\times \text{10}^{\text{-3}}\text{ moles}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


If we had used exactly 100.0 mL of our unknown acid in our titration, the concentration of our acid would be:


&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{}^{\left( \text{1}\text{.26}\times \text{10}^{\text{-3}}\text{ moles} \right)}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\left( 0.1000\text{ L} \right)}\;=\text{1}\text{.26}\times \text{10}^{\text{-2}}\text{ M}&lt;/math&gt;
.&lt;/center&gt;

 a. You are given a solution containing an unknown concentration of HCl. You&lt;br&gt; carefully measure 50.0 mL of this solution into a flask and then add a few drops of&lt;br&gt; phenolphthalein solution. You prepare a buret containing 0.055 M NaOH and&lt;br&gt; note that the initial level of the solution in the buret is 12.6 mL. You&lt;br&gt; slowly add the NaOH solution to the acid until the color change ''just''&lt;br&gt; occurs (as evidence of the color change becomes visible, you carefully&lt;br&gt; stir the solution after each drop has been added). When the acid&lt;br&gt; solution turns (and remains) pink, you note that the volume in the buret is now&lt;br&gt; 28.9 mL. What is the concentration of the unknown acid solution?

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''Study Points'''==

* A bond that is formed from a hydrogen atom, which is part of a polar covalent bond (such as the O—H bond) to another, more electronegative atom (that has at least one unshared pair of electrons in its valence shell) is called a '''hydrogen bond'''. Hydrogen bonds are ''weak'', partially covalent bonds. The '''bond dissociation energy''' of the O—H covalent bond 464 kJ/mole; the bond dissociation energy an O—H••••O hydrogen bond is about 21 kJ/mole. 
* Even though hydrogen bonds are relatively weak, the ''vast network'' of hydrogen bonds in water makes the energy significant, and hydrogen bonding is generally used to explain the high boiling point of water (100 ˚C), relative to molecules of similar mass that ''cannot'' hydrogen bond. The extra energy represents the energy required to break down the hydrogen bonding network.
* Polar molecules, such as '''acids''', strongly hydrogen bond to water. This hydrogen bonding not only ''stabilizes'' the molecular dipoles, but also ''weakens ''the H—'''A''' covalent bond ('''A''' represents the acid molecule). As a result of this weakening, the H—'''A''' bond in these acids stretches (the bond length increases) and then fully breaks. The hydrogen that was hydrogen-bonded to the water molecule now becomes ''fully'' bonded to the oxygen, forming the species H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (the '''hydronium ion''') and the acid now exists as an anion ('''A&lt;sup&gt;–'''&lt;/sup&gt;); this is the process of '''acid dissociation'''.
* The hydronium ion and the acid anion that are formed in an acid dissociation can react to re-form the original acid. This represents a set of forward- and back-reactions that occur together on a ''very fast'' time-scale; this type of a set of reactions is called an '''equilibrium''' and a double arrow is used in the chemical reaction to show this. This type of reaction is referred to as an '''acid dissociation equilibrium'''.

&lt;center&gt;HA ''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  &amp;#8644;   H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq)'' + A&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq)''&lt;/center&gt;

* For any equilibrium, an '''equilibrium constant''' can be written that describes whether the ''products'' or the ''reactants'' will be the predominant species in solution. For the dissociation of the simple acid, HA, the equilibrium constant, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, is simply given by the ratio of the concentrations of the products and the reactants, '''excluding any solid or liquid reactants or products''' (such as water). Thus for the ionization of HA;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K_{a}=\frac{\left[ \text{H}_{\text{3}}\text{O}^{+} \right]\left[ \text{A}^{-} \right]}{\left[ \text{HA} \right]}&lt;/math&gt;
.&lt;/center&gt;


* According to the '''Brønsted Acid-Base Theory''', any substance that ionizes in water to form hydronium ions (a '''proton donor''') is called an '''acid'''; any substance that ''accepts'' a proton from a hydronium ion is a '''base'''. In an acid-base equilibrium, the '''conjugate acid''' is defined as the species that ''donates'' a hydrogen (a proton) in the ''forward'' reaction, and the '''conjugate base''' is the species that ''accepts'' a hydrogen (a proton) the ''reverse'' reaction. Thus for the ionization of HCl, HCl is the conjugate acid and Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; is the conjugate base.

&lt;center&gt;HCl ''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O  &amp;#8644;  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq)'' + Cl&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; ''(aq)''&lt;/center&gt;

* Metal hydroxides, such as NaOH, dissolve in water to form metal cations and hydroxide anion. Hydroxide anion is a strong '''Brønsted base''' and, therefore, hydroxide anion accepts a proton from the hydronium ion to form ''two moles of water''. The reaction of a Brønsted acid with a Brønsted base to form water is the process of '''neutralization'''.
* Just like water can promote the ionization of acids, water can also promote the ionization of ''itself''. This equilibrium process occurs very rapidly in pure water and any sample of pure water will ''always ''contain a small concentration of hydronium and hydroxide ions. In pure water, at 25 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C, the concentration of hydronium ions ([H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]) and hydroxide ions ([HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;]) will both be equal to exactly '''1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; M'''. This is referred to as the '''autoprotolysis''' of water.
* The equilibrium for the autoprotolysis of water is defined as''' ''K''&lt;sub&gt;w'''&lt;/sub&gt;, according to the equation shown below:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K_{W}=\left[ \text{H}_{\text{3}}\text{O}^{+} \right]\left[ \text{HO}^{-} \right]&lt;/math&gt;
, and at neutrality, [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and [HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;] are ''both'' 1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; M, making the value of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K_{W}=\left[ 1\times 10^{-7} \right]\left[ 1\times 10^{-7} \right]=1\times 10^{-14}&lt;/math&gt;
.&lt;/center&gt;

* Based on the autoprotolysis equilibrium, acidic, basic and neutral solutions can be defined as:
*# A solution is '''acidic''' if [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] &gt; 1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; M. 
*# A solution is '''basic''' if [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] &lt; 1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; M. 
*# A solution is '''neutral''' if [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; M.
* A '''''p''H''' value is simply the ''negative'' of the logarithm of the hydronium ion concentration (-log[H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]). 
* Remember that a logarithm consists of two sets of numbers; the digits to the left of the decimal point (the '''characteristic''') reflect the integral power of 10, and are ''not included'' when you count significant figures. The numbers ''after'' the decimal (the '''mantissa''') have the same significance as your experimental number, thus a logarithm of 4.15482 represents ''five'' significant figures.
* In an '''acid-base''' '''titration''' a solution of acid or base with a known concentration is slowly add to an acid or base solution with an ''unknown'' concentration, using a volumetric '''burette''', to until neutrality has been achieved. Typically an indicator or a pH meter is used to signify neutrality.
* At neutrality, the ''volume'' and ''concentration'' of the reactant you have added is known, which means that you can calculate the number of ''moles'' that you added (remember, '''concentration &amp;times; volume = moles'''). Based on the stoichiometry of your neutralization reaction, you then know how many moles of acid or base were in the unknown sample.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;big&gt;'''Chapter 9. The Gaseous State '''&lt;/big&gt;==
'''Some of the first real breakthroughs in the study of chemistry happened in the study of the gaseous state. In gases, the volume of the actual gas particles is but a tiny fraction of the total volume that the gas occupies. This allowed early chemists to relate parameters such as volume and the number of gas particles, leading to the development of the mole concept. As we have seen in previous chapters, the notion of a chemical mole allows us to do quantitative chemistry and lead us to the point where we can routinely address reaction stoichiometry, etc. In this chapter, we will visit some of the early observations that lead to our current understand of gasses and how they behave. We will see how the relationships between pressure and volume; volume and temperature and volume and moles lead to the ideal gas laws and how these simple rules can allow us to do quantitative calculations in the gas phase.'''

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''9.1 Gasses and Atmospheric Pressure'''==

In Chapter 2, we learned about the three principle states of matter; solids, liquids and gasses. We explained the properties of the states of matter using the ''kinetic molecular theory'' (KMT). Substances in the gaseous state, according to the KMT, have enough kinetic energy to break ''all'' of the attractive forces between the individual gas particles and are therefore free to separate and rapidly move throughout the entire volume of their container. Because there is so much space between the particles in a gas, a gas is ''highly compressible.'' High compressibility and the ability of gases to take on the shape and volume of its container are two of the important physical properties of gasses.

The gas that we are all most familiar with is the mixture of elements and compounds that we call the “atmosphere”. The air that we breath is mostly nitrogen and oxygen, with much smaller amounts of water vapor, carbon dioxide, noble gasses and the organic compound, methane (Table 9.1).

A gas that is enclosed in a container exerts a ''pressure'' on the inner walls of that container. This pressure is the result of the countless collisions of the gas particles with the container wall [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/9.1.html (Figure 9.1)](. As each collision occurs, a small amount of energy is transferred, generating a net pressure. Although we are generally unaware of it, the gasses in the atmosphere generate a tremendous pressure on all of us. At sea level, atmospheric pressure is equal to 14.7 pounds per square inch. Putting this in perspective, for a person of average height and build, the total pressure from the atmosphere pressing on their body is about 45,000 pounds! Why aren’t we squashed? Remember, we also have air ''inside'' our bodies and the pressure from the inside balances the pressure outside, keeping us nice and firm, not squishy!

The proper SI unit for pressure is the Pascal (Pa), where 1 Pa = 1 kg m&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. In chemistry, however, it is more common to measure pressure in terms of atmospheres (atm) where 1 atm is atmospheric pressure at sea level, or 1 atm = 14.7 pounds per square inch (1 atm = 101,325 Pa). Atmospheric pressure is typically measured using a device called a ''barometer''. A simple mercury barometer (also called a ''Torricelli barometer, ''after its inventor) consists of a glass column, about 30 inches high, closed at one end and filled with mercury. The column is inverted and placed in an open, mercury-filled reservoir. The weight of the mercury in the tube causes the column to drop to the point that the mass of the mercury column matches the atmospheric pressure exerted on the mercury in the reservoir. The atmospheric pressure is then read as the ''height'' of the mercury column. Again, working at sea level, 1 atmosphere is ''exactly'' equal to a column height of 760 mm of mercury. The units for the conversion are 1 atm = 760 mm Hg, and this is an ''exact'' relationship with regard to significant figures. The unit ''torr'' (after Torricelli) is sometimes used in place of mm Hg. A schematic of a mercury barometer is shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/9.2.html Figure 9.2].

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''9.2 The Pressure-Volume Relationship: Boyle’s Law'''==

The kinetic molecular theory is useful when we are trying to understand the properties and behaviors of gases. The KMT (and related theories) tell us that:

* There is a tremendous amount of distance between individual particles in the gas phase.
* Gas particles move randomly at various speeds and in every possible direction.
* Attractive forces between individual gas particles are negligible.
* Collisions between gas particles are fully elastic.
* The average kinetic energy of particles in the gas phase is proportional to the temperature of the gas.

In reality, these predictions only apply to “ideal gases”. An ideal gas has perfectly elastic collisions and has no interactions with its neighbors or with the container. Real gases deviate from these predictions, but at common temperatures and pressures, the deviations are generally small and in this text we will treat all gases as if they were “ideal”.

Because there is so much empty space between gas molecules, it is easy to see why a gas is so compressible. If you have a container filled with a gas, you can ''squeeze ''it down to a smaller volume by applying pressure. The harder you squeeze (the more pressure you apply) the smaller the resulting volume will be. Imagine a bicycle pump compressing air into a tire [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/9.3.html (Figure 9.3)]. As pressure is applied to the pump, the same number of gas molecules are squeezed into a smaller volume.

The dependence of volume on pressure is not linear. In 1661, Robert Boyle systematically studied the compressibility of gasses in response to increasing pressure. Boyle found that the dependence of volume on pressure was ''non-linear'' [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/9.4.html (Figure 9.4)] but that a linear plot could be obtained if the volume was plotted against the ''reciprocal'' of the pressure, 1/''P''. This is stated as '''''Boyle’s law:'''''

'''The volume (''V'') of an ideal gas varies ''inversely'' with the applied pressure (''P'') when the temperature (''T'') and the number of moles (''n'') of the gas are constant.'''

Mathematically, Boyle’s law can be stated as:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;V\propto \frac{1}{P}\text{    }\left( \text{at constant }T\text{ and }n \right)&lt;/math&gt;
, and&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;V=\text{ }constant\text{ }\left( \frac{1}{P} \right)\text{, or, }PV\text{=}constant&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

We can use Boyle’s law to predict what will happen to the volume of a sample of gas as we change the pressure. Because ''PV'' is a constant for any given sample of gas (at constant ''T''), we can imagine two states; an initial state with a certain pressure and volume (''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;), and a final state with different values for pressure and volume (''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Because ''PV'' is always a constant, we can equate the two states and write: 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;P_{1}V_{1}=P_{2}V_{2}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Now imagine that we have a container with a piston that we can use to compress the gas inside (for example, [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/9.5.html Figure 9.5]). You are told that, initially, the pressure in the container is 765 mm Hg and the volume is 1.00 L. The piston is then adjusted so that the volume is now 0.500 L; what is the final pressure?

We substitute into our Boyle’s law equation:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;P_{1}V_{1}=P_{2}V_{2}&lt;/math&gt;
, or, 
&lt;math&gt;\left( 765\text{ mm Hg} \right)\left( \text{1}\text{.00 L} \right)=P_{2}\left( 0.500\text{ L} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;P_{2}=\left( \frac{\left( 765\text{ mm Hg} \right)\left( \text{1}\text{.00 L} \right)}{0.500\text{ L}} \right)=1530\text{ mm Hg}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp9.1.html ''' Example 9.1  Pressure-Volume Relationships''']

 A container with a piston contains a sample of gas. Initially, the pressure in &lt;br&gt;the container is exactly 1 atm, but the volume is unknown. The piston is &lt;br&gt;adjusted so that the volume is 0.155 L and the pressure is 956 mm Hg; what was &lt;br&gt;the initial volume?


[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex9.1.html ''' Exercise 9.1 Pressure-Volume Relationships ''']

 The pressure of 12.5 L of a gas is 0.82 atm. If the pressure changes to 1.32 atm, &lt;br&gt;what will the final volume be?
 A sample of helium gas has a pressure of 860.0 mm Hg. This gas is transferred to a &lt;br&gt;different container having a volume of 25.0 L; in this new container, the &lt;br&gt;pressure is determined to be 770.0 mm Hg. What was the initial volume of the gas?

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''9.3 The Temperature-Volume Relationship: Charles’s Law'''==

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/9.6.html Figure 9.6] shows a fun laboratory demonstration in which a fully inflated balloon is placed in liquid nitrogen (at a temperature of –196 ˚C) and it shrinks to about 1/1000&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of its former size. If the balloon is carefully removed and allowed to warm to room temperature, it will again be fully inflated.

This is a simple demonstration of the effect of temperature on the volume of a gas. In 1787, Jacques Charles performed a systematic study of the effect of temperature on gases. Charles took samples of gases at various temperatures, but at the same pressure, and measured their volumes. A plot showing representative results is shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/9.7.html Figure 9.7].

The first thing to note is that the plot is ''linear''. When the pressure is constant, volume is a direct linear function of temperature. This is stated as '''''Charles’s law:'''''

'''The volume (''V'') of an ideal gas varies ''directly'' with the temperature of the gas (''T'') when the pressure (''P'') and the number of moles (''n'') of the gas are constant.'''

We can express this mathematically as:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;V\propto T\text{    }\left( \text{at constant }P\text{ and }n \right)&lt;/math&gt;
, and&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;V=\text{ }constant\text{ }\left( T \right)\text{,   or,   }\frac{V}{T}\text{=}constant&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/9.7.html Figure 9.7] shows data for three different samples of the same gas; 0.25 moles, 0.50 moles and 0.75 moles. All of these samples behave as predicted by Charles’s law (the plots are all linear), but , if you extrapolate each of the lines back to the ''y''-axis (the temperature axis), all three lines intersect at the same point! This point, with a temperature of –273.15 ˚C, is the theoretical point where the samples would have “zero volume”. This temperature, -273.15 ˚C, is called '''absolute zero'''. An even more intriguing thing is that the value of absolute zero is independent of the nature of the gas that is used. Hydrogen, oxygen, helium, argon, (or whatever), all gases show the same behavior and ''all'' intersect at the same point.

The temperature of this intersection point is taken as “zero” on the Kelvin temperature scale. The abbreviation used in the Kelvin scale is '''K''' (no degree sign) and there are ''never'' negative values in degrees Kelvin. The size of the degree increment in Kelvin is identical to that in Centigrade and Kelvin and centigrade scales are related by the simple conversion:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\text{Kelvin=centigrade+273}\text{.15}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


Please note that whenever you work gas law problems where temperature is one variable, you MUST use the Kelvin scale.

Just like we did for pressure-volume problems, we can use Charles’s law to predict what will happen to the volume of a sample of gas as we change the temperature. Because 
&lt;math&gt;{}^{V}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{T}\;&lt;/math&gt; is a constant for any given sample of gas (at constant ''P''), we can again imagine two states; an initial state with a certain temperature and volume (
&lt;math&gt;{}^{V_{1}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{T_{1}}\;&lt;/math&gt;
), and a final state with different values for pressure and volume ([
&lt;math&gt;{}^{V_{2}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{T_{2}}\;&lt;/math&gt;). Because 
&lt;math&gt;{}^{V}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{T}\;&lt;/math&gt; is always a constant, we can equate the two states and write:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Again, we have a container with a piston that we can use to adjust the pressure on the gas inside. You are told that, initially, the temperature of the gas in the container is 175 K and the volume is 1.50 L. The temperature is changed to 76 K and the piston is then adjusted so that the pressure is identical to the pressure in the initial state; what is the final volume?

We substitute into our Charles’s law equation:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, or, 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\left( \text{1}\text{.50 L} \right)}{175\text{ K}}=\frac{V_{2}}{76\text{ K}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;V_{2}=\left( \frac{\left( 76\text{ K} \right)\left( \text{1}\text{.50 L} \right)}{\text{175 K}} \right)=0.65\text{ L}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp9.2.html ''' Example 9.2  Temperature-Volume Relationships''']

 A container with a piston contains a sample of gas. Initially, the pressure in the &lt;br&gt;container is exactly 1 atm, the temperature is 14.0 ˚C and the volume is 997 mL. &lt;br&gt;The temperature is raised to 100.0 ˚C and the piston is adjusted so that &lt;br&gt;the pressure is again exactly 1 atm What is the final volume?

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''9.4 The Mole-Volume Relationship: Avogadro’s Law'''==

In [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/9.7.html Figure 9.7], we made a plot of the effect of temperature on the volume of a gas at constant pressure. The plot shows three lines, one for 0.025 moles of gas, one for 0.50 moles and one for 0.75 moles. If you take these data and combine them with data for other molar quantities, and plot them as a function of the volume at constant temperature and constant pressure, you can obtain a plot similar to that shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/9.8.html Figure 9.8]. The data in this plot form a linear series, passing through the origin. What this simply says is that the volume of a gas is directly proportional to the number of moles of that gas. This is stated as '''''Avogadro’s law:'''''

'''The volume (''V'') of an ideal gas varies ''directly'' with the number of moles of the gas (''n'') when the pressure (''P'') and the number of temperature (''T'') are constant.'''

We can express this mathematically as:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;V\propto n\text{    }\left( \text{at constant }P\text{ and }T \right)&lt;/math&gt;
, and&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;V= constant\times \left( n \right),   or,   \frac{V}{n}=constant&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

As before, we can use Avogadro’s law to predict what will happen to the volume of a sample of gas as we change the number of moles. Because &lt;math&gt;{}^{V}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{n}\;&lt;/math&gt;
is a constant for any given sample of gas (at constant ''P'' and ''T''), we can again imagine two states; an initial state with a certain number of moles and volume (
&lt;math&gt;{}^{V_{1}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{n_{1}}\;&lt;/math&gt;), and a final state with values for a different number of moles and volume (&lt;math&gt;{}^{V_{2}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{n_{2}}\;&lt;/math&gt;
). Because 
&lt;math&gt;{}^{V}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{n}\;&lt;/math&gt;
is always a constant, we can equate the two states and write:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_{1}}{n_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{n_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

As an example of this type of problem, we have a container with a piston that we can use to adjust the pressure on the gas inside, and we can control the temperature. You are told that, initially, the container contains 0.20 moles of hydrogen gas and 0.10 mole of oxygen in a volume is 2.40 L. The two gases are allowed to react (a spark ignites the mixture) and the piston is then adjusted so that the pressure is identical to the pressure in the initial state and the container is cooled to the initial temperature; what is the final volume of the product of the reaction?

First, we need to look at the reaction involved. Hydrogen and oxygen react to form water. Two moles of hydrogen react with one mole of oxygen to give two moles of water, as shown below:

&lt;center&gt;2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''  &amp;rarr;  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ''(g)''&lt;/center&gt;


Initially we have three moles of gas and, after reaction, we have two moles. We can now substitute into Avogadro’s law:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_{1}}{n_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{n_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;, or, 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\text{2}\text{.40 L}}{\text{3 moles}}=\frac{V_{2}}{2\text{ moles}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;V_{2}=\left( \frac{\left( 2.\text{40 L} \right)\left( \text{2 moles} \right)}{\text{3 moles}} \right)=1.60\text{ L}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Thus we have described the dependence of the volume of a gas on the pressure (Boyle’s law), the temperature (Charles’s law) and the number of moles of the gas (Avogadro’s law). In the following section, we will combine these to generate the Ideal Gas Law, in which all three variables (pressure, temperature and number of moles) can vary independently.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''9.5 The Ideal Gas Law'''==

The three gas laws that we covered in Section 9.2 – 9.5 describe the effect of pressure, temperature and the number of moles of a gas on volume. The three independent gas laws are:

* '''''Boyle’s law:'''''  &lt;math&gt;V\propto {}^{1}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{P}\;&lt;/math&gt;
* '''''Charles’s law:'''''  &lt;math&gt;V\propto T\text{ }&lt;/math&gt;
* '''''Avogadro’s law:'''''  &lt;math&gt;V\propto n\text{ }&lt;/math&gt;

If volume (''V'') is proportion to each of these variables, it must also be proportional to their product:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;V\propto \left( {}^{Tn}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{P}\; \right)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

If we replace the proportionality symbol with a constant (let’s just choose '''''R''''' to represent our constant), we can re-write the equation as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{V=R}\left( {}^{\mathsf{nT}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\mathsf{P}}\; \right)&lt;/math&gt;, or rearranging, &lt;math&gt;PV=nRT&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

The value of the proportionality constant ''R'', can be calculated from the fact that exactly one mole of a gas at exactly 1 atm and at 0 ˚C (273 K) has a volume of 22.414 L ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/9.9.html Figure 9.9)]. Substituting in the equation:

&lt;center&gt;


&lt;math&gt;PV=nRT&lt;/math&gt;, or, &lt;math&gt;R=\frac{PV}{nT}&lt;/math&gt; and 
&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{\left( \text{1 atm} \right)\left( 22.414\text{ L} \right)}{\left( \text{1 mole} \right)\left( 273\text{ K} \right)}=0.082057\text{ L atm mol}^{\text{-1}}\text{ K}^{\text{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The uncomfortable and somewhat obnoxious constant is called the '''universal gas constant''', and you will need to know it (or look it up) whenever you solve problems using the combined ideal gas law.


[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp9.3.html ''' Example 9.3  Ideal Gas Law Calculations''']

 What volume will 17.5 grams of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; occupy at a pressure of 876 mm Hg and &lt;br&gt;at 123 ˚C?


Many of the problems that you will encounter when dealing with the gas laws can be solved by simply using the “two-state” approach. Because '''''R''''' is a constant, we can equate an initial and a final state as:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{n_{1}T_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; for the initial state, and 
&lt;math&gt;R=\frac{P_{2}V_{2}}{n_{2}T_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
 for the final state, or, 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{n_{1}T_{1}}=\frac{P_{2}V_{2}}{n_{2}T_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;

Using this equation, you can solve for multiple variables within a single problem.

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp9.4.html ''' Example 9.4 Ideal Gas Law Calculation; Determining Volume ''']

 A sample of oxygen occupies 17.5 L at 0.75 atm and 298 K. The temperature is raised to 303 K and the pressure &lt;br&gt;is increased to 0.987 atm. What is the final volume of the sample?


If you noticed, we calculated the value of the proportionality constant ''R'' based on the fact that ''exactly'' one mole of a gas at ''exactly'' 1 atm and at 0 ˚C (273 K) has a volume of 22.414 L. This is one of the “magic numbers in chemistry; ''exactly'' one mole of ''any'' gas under these conditions will occupy a volume of 22.414 L. The conditions, 1 atm and 0 ˚C, are called '''standard temperature and pressure''', or '''STP'''. The fact that all gases occupy this same molar volume can be rationalized by realizing that 99.999% of a gas is empty space, so it really doesn’t matter what’s in there, it all occupies the same volume. This realization is attributed to Amedeo Avogadro and '''Avogadro’s hypothesis''', published in 1811, suggested that ''equal volumes of all gases at the same temperature and pressure contained the same number of molecules.'' This is the observation that led to the measurement of Avogadro’s number (6.0221415  &amp;times;  10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;), the number of ''things'' in a mole. The importance of the “magic number” of 22.414 L per mole (at STP) is that, when combined with the ideal gas laws, any volume of a gas can be easily converted into the number of moles of that gas. This is shown in the following example:


[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp9.5.html ''' Example 9.5  Ideal Gas Law Calculation; Determining Moles''']

 A sample of methane has a volume of 17.5 L at 100.0 ˚C and 1.72 atm. How many &lt;br&gt;moles of methane are in the sample?

 When 128.9 grams of cyclopropane (C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) are placed into an &lt;br&gt;8.00 L cylinder at 298 K, the pressure is observed to be 1.24 atm. A piston in &lt;br&gt;the cylinder is now adjusted so that the volume is now 12.00 L and the pressure &lt;br&gt;is 0.88 atm. What is the final temperature of the gas?

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''9.6 Combining Stoichiometry and the Ideal Gas Laws'''==

With an understanding of the ideal gas laws, it is now possible to apply these principles to chemical stoichiometry problems. For example, zinc metal and hydrochloric acid (hydrogen chloride dissolved in water) react to form zinc (II) chloride and hydrogen gas according to the equation shown below:

&lt;center&gt;2 HCl ''(aq)'' + Zn ''(s)'' &amp;rarr; ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''&lt;/center&gt;


A sample of pure zinc with a mass of 5.98 g is reacted with excess hydrochloric acid and the (dry) hydrogen gas is collected at 25.0 ˚C and 742 mm Hg. What ''volume'' of hydrogen gas would be produced?

This is a “single state” problem, so we can solve it using the ideal gas law, ''PV = nRT''. In order to find the volume of hydrogen gas (''V''), we need to know the number of ''moles'' of hydrogen that will be produced by the reaction. Our stoichiometry is simply ''one mole of hydrogen per mole of zinc'', so we need to know the number of moles of zinc that are present in 5.98 grams of zinc metal. The temperature is given in centigrade, so we need to convert into Kelvin, and we also need to convert mm Hg into atm.

Conversions: 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\text{25}\text{.0 C+273=298 K}&lt;/math&gt;; 
&lt;math&gt;\left( 742\text{ mm Hg} \right)\times \left( \frac{\text{1 atm}}{\text{760 mm Hg}} \right)\text{=0}\text{.976 atm}&lt;/math&gt;
;&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left( 5.\text{98 g Zn} \right)\times \left( \frac{\text{1}\text{.00 mol}}{\text{65}\text{.39 g Zn}} \right)\text{=0}\text{.0915 mol}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Substituting: 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;PV=nRT&lt;/math&gt;, or, &lt;math&gt;\left( \text{0}\text{.976 atm} \right)\times V=\left( 0.0915\text{ mol} \right)\left( 0.0821\text{ L atm mol}^{\text{-1}}\text{ K}^{\text{-1}} \right)\left( 2\text{98 K} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;V=\frac{\left( 0.0915\text{ mol} \right)\left( 0.0821\text{ L atm mol}^{\text{-1}}\text{ K}^{\text{-1}} \right)\left( 2\text{98 K} \right)}{\left( \text{0}\text{.976 atm} \right)}=2.29\text{ L}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


We can also use the fact that one mole of a gas occupies 22.414 L at STP in order to calculate the number of moles of a gas that is produced in a reaction. For example, the organic molecule ethane (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) reacts with oxygen to give carbon dioxide and water according to the equation shown below:

&lt;center&gt;2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' + 7 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''  &amp;rarr;  4 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ''(g)''&lt;/center&gt;


A sample problem might read like this; an unknown mass of ethane is allowed to react with excess oxygen and the carbon dioxide produced is separated and collected. The carbon dioxide collected is found to occupy 11.23 L at STP; what mass of ethane was in the original sample?

Because the volume of carbon dioxide is measured at STP, the observed value can be converted directly into ''moles of carbon dioxide'' by dividing by 22.414 L mol&lt;sup&gt;–1&lt;/sup&gt;. Once moles of carbon dioxide are known, the stoichiometry of the problem can be used to directly give moles of ethane (molar mass 30.07 g mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), which leads directly to the ''mass'' of ethane in the sample.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left( 1\text{1}\text{.23 L CO}_{\text{2}} \right)\times \left( \frac{\text{1 mol}}{\text{22}\text{.414 L}} \right)\text{=0}\text{.501 mol CO}_{\text{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Reaction stoichiometry:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left( \text{0}\text{.501 mol CO}_{\text{2}} \right)\times \left( \frac{\text{2 mol CH}_{\text{3}}\text{CH}_{\text{3}}}{\text{4 mol CO}_{\text{2}}} \right)\text{=0}\text{.250 mol CH}_{\text{3}}\text{CH}_{\text{3}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

The ideal gas laws allow a quantitative analysis of whole spectrum of chemical reactions. When you are approaching these problems, remember to ''first'' decide on the ''class'' of the problem:

* If it is a “single state” problem (a gas is produced at a single, given, set of conditions), then you want to use ''PV = nRT.''
* If it is a “two state” problem (a gas is changed from one set of conditions to another) you want to use 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{n_{1}T_{1}}=\frac{P_{2}V_{2}}{n_{2}T_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
.
* If the volume of gas is quoted at STP, you can quickly convert this volume into moles with by dividing by 22.414 L mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Once you have isolated your approach ideal gas law problems are no more complex that the stoichiometry problems we have addressed in earlier chapters.

A sample &lt;br&gt;of 96.9 grams of Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is heated in the presence of &lt;br&gt;excess carbon and the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; produced is collected and measured at 1 atm &lt;br&gt;and 453 K. What volume of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be observed?

&lt;center&gt;2 Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''(s)'' + 3 C ''(s)''  &amp;rarr;  4 Fe ''(s)'' + 3 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''&lt;/center&gt;


 The reaction of zinc and hydrochloric acid generates hydrogen gas, according to &lt;br&gt;the equation shown below. An unknown quantity of zinc in a sample is observed &lt;br&gt;to produce 7.50 L of hydrogen gas at a temperature of 404 K and a pressure of &lt;br&gt;1.75 atm. How many moles of zinc were in the sample?

&lt;center&gt;Zn ''(s)'' + 2 HCl ''(aq)''  &amp;rarr;  ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''&lt;/center&gt;

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''Study Points '''==

* Gasses are ''compressible'' because there is so much space between individual gas particles. Energy transferred from the collision of gas particles with their container exerts a ''gas pressure''. In chemistry, we typically measure gas pressure using units of ''atmospheres'' (atm) or in ''mm Hg'' (also referred to as torr). One atmosphere of pressure equals exactly 760 mm Hg.
* The volume of a gas varies ''inversely'' with the applied pressure; the greater the pressure, the smaller the volume. This is relationship is referred to as ''Boyles’s Law''. For a two-state system where the number of moles of gas and the temperature remain constant, Boyle’s Law can be expressed as &lt;math&gt;P_{1}V_{1}=P_{2}V_{2}&lt;/math&gt;
.
* The volume of a gas varies ''directly'' with the absolute temperature; the higher the temperature, the larger the volume. This is relationship is referred to as ''Charles’s Law''. For a two-state system where the number of moles of gas and the pressure remain constant, Charles’s Law can be expressed as:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

* In this equation, the ''absolute temperature'' in Kelvin (K) must be used. Kelvin is defined as (degrees centigrade + 273.15). Zero degrees Kelvin is referred to as “absolute zero” and it is the temperature at which (theoretically) all molecular motion would cease.
* The volume of a gas varies ''directly'' with the number of moles of the gas that are present; the greater the number of moles, the larger the volume. This is relationship is referred to as ''Avogadro’s Law''. For a two-state system where the temperature and the pressure of a gas remain constant, Avogadro’s Law can be expressed as:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_{1}}{n_{1}}=\frac{V_{2}}{n_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

* Because the volume of a gas varies directly with the number of moles of the gas that are present and with the absolute temperature (in Kelvin), and inversely with the pressure, the gas laws can be combined into a single proportionality; 

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;V\propto \left( {}^{Tn}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{P}\; \right)&lt;/math&gt;
.&lt;/center&gt;

This proportionality can be converted to an equality by inserting the proportionality constant ''R'' (the universal gas constant), where ''R'' = 0.082057 L atm mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and can be re-written as:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{V=R}\left( {}^{\mathsf{nT}}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\mathsf{P}}\; \right)&lt;/math&gt;
, or rearranging, 
&lt;math&gt;PV=nRT&lt;/math&gt;
.&lt;/center&gt;

This is referred to as the Ideal'' Gas Law'' and is valid for most gasses at low concentrations. For a two-state system where the identity of the gas does not change, the Ideal Gas Law can be expressed as:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{n_{1}T_{1}}=\frac{P_{2}V_{2}}{n_{2}T_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
.&lt;/center&gt;

The gas constant ''R,'' is calculated based on the experimental observation that ''exactly'' one mole of any gas at ''exactly'' 1 atm and at 0 ˚C (273 K) has a volume of '''22.414 L'''. The conditions, 1 atm and 0 ˚C, are called standard temperature and pressure, or ''STP''.

* The ideal gas laws allow a quantitative analysis of whole spectrum of chemical reactions involving gasses. When you are approaching these problems, remember to ''first'' decide on the ''class'' of the problem:

*# If it is a “single state” problem (a gas is produced at a single, given, set of conditions), then you want to use ''PV = nRT.''
*# If it is a “two state” problem (a gas is changed from one set of conditions to another) you want to use 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_{1}V_{1}}{n_{1}T_{1}}=\frac{P_{2}V_{2}}{n_{2}T_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
.
*# If the volume of gas is quoted at STP, you can quickly convert this volume into moles with by dividing by 22.414 L mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;&lt;big&gt;'''Chapter 10. Principles of Chemical Equilibrium'''&lt;/big&gt;==
'''As we have studied chemical reactions in this course, we have used a “reaction arrow” to indicate the process of reactants being converted into products. The implication here is that the reaction is “irreversible”, proceeding in the direction of the arrow. Many simple reactions that we encounter in chemistry, however, are ''not'' irreversible, but proceed in ''both'' directions with products readily be converted back into reactants. When a set of reactions, such as this, proceed so that the ''rate'' of conversion in one direction equals the ''rate'' of conversion in the other, we say the reactions are in equilibrium. An equilibrium system is shown by using a set of double arrows, proceeding in opposite directions. An understanding of equilibrium is essential to an appreciation of the concepts behind acid-base behavior, solubility phenomena, etc.'''

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''10.1 The Concept of Equilibrium Reactions'''==

Pure dinitrogen tetroxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) is a colorless gas that is widely used as a rocket fuel. Although N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is colorless, when a container is filled with pure N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, the gas rapidly begins to turn a dark brown [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/10.1.html (Figure 10.1)]. A chemical reaction is clearly occurring, and indeed, chemical analysis tells us that the gas in the container is no longer pure N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, but has become a mixture of dinitrogen tetroxide and nitrogen dioxide; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is undergoing a ''decomposition reaction'' to form NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If the gaseous mixture is cooled, it again turns colorless and analysis tells us that it is again, almost pure N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;; this means that the NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the mixture can also undergo a ''synthesis reaction'' to re-form N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. A more detailed analysis of the relative concentrations of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at various times gives us the data that are shown in the plot in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/10.2.html Figure 10.2]. Initially, only N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is present. As the reaction proceeds, the concentration of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; decreases and the concentration of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; increases. However, if you examine the figure, after some time, the concentrations of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have ''stabilized'' and, as long as the temperature is not changed, the relative concentrations of the two gasses remain constant.

The reversible reaction of one mole of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, forming two moles of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is a classic example of a''' chemical equilibrium'''. We encountered the concept of equilibrium in Chapter 9 when we dealt with the autolysis of water to form the hydronium and hydroxide ions, and with the dissociation of weak acids in aqueous solution. 


&lt;center&gt;2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &amp;#8644; H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;The autolysis of water; see Section 8.5&lt;/center&gt;


When we wrote these chemical equations, we used a '''double arrow''' to signify that the reaction proceeded in both directions. Using this convention, the dissociation of dinitrogen tetroxide to form two molecules of nitrogen dioxide can be shown as:


&lt;center&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;#8644; 2 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


If the temperature of our gas mixture is again held constant and the total pressure of the gas in the container is varied, analysis shows that the partial pressure of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; varies as the ''square'' of the partial pressure of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/10.3.html Figure 10.3]; remember, the Ideal Gas Laws tell us that the partial pressure of a gas, ''P''&lt;sub&gt;gas&lt;/sub&gt;, is directly proportional to the ''concentration'' of that gas in the container). Mathematically, the relationship between the partial pressures of the two gasses can be expressed by Equation 1.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\left( P_{NO_{2}} \right)^{2}}{P_{N_{2}O_{4}}}=K&lt;/math&gt;
 Equation 1.&lt;/center&gt;

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''10.2 The Equilibrium Constant'''==

The constant in Equation 1 is called the '''equilibrium constant''' for the reaction. What the equilibrium constant for this reaction tells us is that, regardless of pressures (or concentrations), a mixture of the two gasses will undergo reaction such that the ratios of the partial pressures reach a constant value, given by the equilibrium constant, ''K''. Once this constant ratio has been reached does this mean the reactions stop? Of course not; examine [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/10.2.html Figure 10.2]. In the region of the plot where the concentrations of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are constant (the lines are level) N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is still decomposing to form two molecules of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and two molecules of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are still reacting to synthesize a molecule of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, but the lines are level because the '''rates''' of the two chemical reactions have become constant; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is decomposing at the same ''rate'' as two molecules of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are reacting to form N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/10.4.html (Figure 10.4)]

In theory, ''all'' chemical reactions are equilibria. In practice, however, most reactions are so slow in the reverse direction that they are considered “irreversible”. When a reaction evolves a gas, forms a precipitate or proceeds with the generation of a large amount of heat or light (for example, combustion) the reaction is essentially irreversible. Many chemical reactions are, however, readily reversible and for these reactions the mathematical expression for the equilibrium constant can be written using a simple set of rules.


# Partial pressures (or molar concentrations) of products are written in the numerator of the expression and the partial pressures (or concentrations) of the reactants are written in the denominator.
# If there is more that one reactant or more that one product, the partial pressures (or concentrations) are multiplied together.
# The partial pressure (or concentration) of each reactant or product is then raised to the power that numerically equals the stoichiometric coefficient appearing with that term in the balanced chemical equation.
# Reactants or products that are present as solids or liquids ''do not appear'' in the equilibrium expression.

Thus, for the reaction of nitrogen with hydrogen gas to form ammonia:

&lt;center&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' &amp;#8644; 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''&lt;/center&gt;


The expression for the equilibrium constant will have the partial pressure of ammonia in the numerator, and it will be ''squared'', corresponding to the coefficient “2” in the balanced equation; &lt;math&gt;\left( P_{NH_{3}} \right)^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Because there are two reactants, the partial pressures for nitrogen and hydrogen will be ''multiplied'' in the denominator. The partial pressure of nitrogen will be raised to the “first power” (which is not shown) and the partial pressure of hydrogen will be ''cubed'', corresponding to the coefficient “3”; 
&lt;math&gt;\left( P_{N_{2}} \right)\left( P_{H_{2}} \right)^{3}&lt;/math&gt;. The final expression for the equilibrium constant is given in Equation 2.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\left( P_{NH_{3}} \right)^{2}}{P_{N_{2}}\left( P_{H_{2}} \right)^{3}}=K&lt;/math&gt;
 Equation 2.&lt;/center&gt;

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp10.1.html ''' Example 10.1 Writing Equilibrium Expressions''']

For the chemical reactions shown below, write an expression for the equilibrium constant in terms of the partial pressures of the reactants and products.

 PCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' &amp;#8644; PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''
 2 NOCl ''(g)'' &amp;#8644; 2 NO'' (g)'' + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex10.1.html ''' Exercise 10.1 Writing Equilibrium Expressions''']

For the chemical reaction shown below, write an expression for the equilibrium constant in terms of the partial pressures of the reactants and products.

 PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' + 3 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' &amp;#8644; P(NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' + 3 HCl ''(g)''


== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''10.3 Calculating Equilibrium Values'''==

The numeric value of the equilibrium constant tells us something about the ''ratio'' of the reactants and products in the final equilibrium mixture. Likewise, the magnitude of the equilibrium constant tells us about the actual composition of that mixture. 

In the three equilibrium systems shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/10.5.html Figure 10.5], the first depicts a reaction in which the ratio of products to reactants is very ''small''. Because the expression for the equilibrium constant is given by the pressure (or concentration) of products divided by the pressure (or concentration) of reactants, the equilibrium constant, ''K'', for this system is also small. In the second example, the concentrations of reactants and products are shown to be ''equal'', making the ratio (the equilibrium constant) equal to “1”. In the last example, the products are shown to dominate the equilibrium mixture, making the ratio 
&lt;math&gt;{}^{\left( P_{Products} \right)}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{\left( P_{Reactants} \right)}\;&lt;/math&gt;very large. In these examples, the stoichiometric ratios of the reactants and products are one and there is only one reactant and only one product; if multiple reactants or products are involved, the relationship between their concentrations would be more complex, but that ratio is always given by the expression for ''K''. This fact allows us to take data for an equilibrium reaction and, if ''K'' is known, calculate concentrations for reactants and products. Likewise, if all of the equilibrium concentrations are known, we can use these to calculate a value for the equilibrium constant. 

In these types of problems, an ''ICE'' table is often useful. This table has entries for ''Initial'' concentrations (or pressures), ''Equilibrium'' concentrations and any ''Change'' between the initial and equilibrium states. For example, consider the reaction between carbon monoxide and chlorine to form phosgene, a deadly compound that was used as a gas warfare agent in World War I. [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/10.6.html (Figure 10.6)]

&lt;center&gt;CO ''(g) ''+ Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g) ''&amp;#8644; COCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''&lt;/center&gt;


A typical equilibrium problem might read as follows:


A mixture of CO and Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has initial partial pressures of 0.60 atm for CO and 1.10 atm for Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. After the mixture reaches equilibrium, the partial pressure of COCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 0.10 atm. Determine the value of'' K.''


The initial pressures for carbon monoxide and chlorine are placed in the first row and the equilibrium pressure for phosgene is placed in the last row. '''''Initially''''', the pressure of phosgene was zero, so that goes in the first row; the change for phosgene is therefore “+ 0.10 atm”.

Because one mole of CO is required to make one mole of COCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; the partial pressure of CO must have dropped by 0.10 atm (the '''''Change''''') in order to make COCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a partial pressure of 0.10 atm, giving a final ('''''Equilibrium''''') pressure of 0.50 atm for carbon monoxide. Likewise, one mole of chlorine is required to make one mole of COCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; making the '''''Change''''' for chlorine 0.10 atm and the '''''Equilibrium''''' partial pressure 1.00 atm. The completed table is shown below.

The equilibrium expression for the phosgene-forming reaction is given by Equation 3.

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{P_{COCl_{2}}}{P_{CO}P_{Cl_{2}}}=K&lt;/math&gt;
 Equation 3.&lt;/center&gt;

Substituting the values from the Table into this equation:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K=\frac{P_{COCl_{2}}}{P_{CO}P_{Cl_{2}}}=\frac{\left( 0.10 \right)}{\left( 0.50 \right)\left( 1.00 \right)}=0.20&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


Notice that equilibrium constants for gas phase reactions are not typically written with units, although units are sometimes used in equilibrium constants calculated from molar concentrations. Many textbooks differentiate between equilibrium constants calculated from partial pressures and molar concentrations by affixing subscripts; ''K''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. In this book, we will simply use ''K'' and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; to represent the two; a value for ''K'' will always denote a constant calculated from partial pressure data.

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp10.2.html ''' Example 10.2 Determining Equilibrium Values''']

For the reaction shown below, all four gasses are introduced into a vessel, each with an initial partial pressure of 0.500 atm, and allowed to come to equilibrium; at equilibrium, the partial pressure of SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is found to be 0.750 atm. Determine the value of'' K.''

&lt;center&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g) ''+ NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g) ''&amp;#8644; SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g) ''+ NO ''(g)''&lt;/center&gt;

[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex10.2.html ''' Exercise 10.2 Determining Equilibrium Values ''']

For the reaction shown above, the initial partial pressures of SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NO are 0.500 atm under conditions where the equilibrium constant is, ''K'' = 9.00. The equilibrium partial pressure for SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is found to be 0.125 atm. Calculate the equilibrium partial pressure for SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;div align=&quot;right&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''10.4 Using Molarity in Equilibrium Calculations'''==

As we have pointed out several times in the preceding sections, the Ideal Gas Laws (Chapter 10) tell us that the '''partial pressure''' of a gas and the '''molar concentration''' of that gas are directly proportional. We can show this simply by beginning with the combined gas law: 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P_{gas}V=nRT&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

If we divide both sides by the volume, ''V'', and state that ''V'' must be expressed in liters, the right side of the equation now contains the term &lt;math&gt;\left( {}^{n}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{V_{liters}}\; \right)&lt;/math&gt;. Realizing that the number of moles of gas (''n'') divided by the volume in liters is equal to ''molarity'', ''M'', this expression can be re-written as:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P_{gas}=MRT&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


Using this expression, molar concentrations can easily be substituted for partial pressures, and ''visa versa.''


[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp10.3.html ''' Example 10.3 Using Molarity in Equilibrium Calculations''']

For the reaction shown below, if the molar concentrations of SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NO and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are all 0.100 ''M'', what is the equilibrium concentration of NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;?


[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex10.3.html ''' Exercise 10.3 arity in Equilibrium Calculations''']

For the reaction between carbon monoxide and chlorine to form phosgene, the equilibrium constant calculated from partial pressures is ''K'' = 0.20. How does this value relate to the equilibrium constant, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;, under the same conditions, calculated from molar concentrations?

&lt;center&gt;CO ''(g) ''+ Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g) ''&amp;#8644; COCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)''&lt;/center&gt;

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''10.5 Le Chatelier's Principle: ''Stress'' and Equilibria'''==

Consider a simple chemical system that is at equilibrium, such as dinitrogen tetroxide: nitrogen dioxide. The Law of Mass Action states that when this system reaches equilibrium, the ratio of the products and reactants (at a given temperature) will be defined by the equilibrium constant, ''K''. Now imagine that, after equilibrium has been reached, ''more'' dinitrogen tetroxide is introduced into the container. In order for the ratio to remain constant (as defined by ''K'') some of the N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; that you added must be converted to NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The addition of reactants or products to a system at equilibrium is commonly referred to as a “stress”. The response of the system to this stress is dictated by '''Le Chatelier's Principle''', which states that, if a &quot;stress&quot; is applied to a chemical reaction at equilibrium, the system will readjust in the direction that best ''reduces'' the stress imposed on the system. Again, ''stress'' refers to a change in '''concentration''', a change in '''pressure''' or a change in '''temperature''', depending on the system being examined. If pressure or temperature are changed, the numeric value ''K'' will change; '''if only concentration changes are involved, ''K'' does ''not'' change'''. We will consider temperature and pressure effects in General Chemistry, but for now, remember; in a reaction at equilibrium, the introduction of more products will shift the mass balance towards more reactants, but the ratio of ''Products/Reactants'' (as defined by the equilibrium expression) does ''not'' change, hence, ''K'' is unchanged. 

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''10.6 Equilibria involving Acids and Bases'''==

In Chapter 8, we learned that a “weak acid” was only partially dissociated in solution, while a “strong acid” was fully dissociated. Now that we better understand the concept of equilibrium, these two classes of Brønsted acids can simply be differentiated based on their equilibrium constants. For an acid, BH, that dissociates in water to form B&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; and hydronium ion, we can write a simple equilibrium expression, as follows.

&lt;center&gt;BH''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)'' &amp;#8644; B&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)''&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K_{C}=\frac{\left[ H_{3}O^{+} \right]\left[ B^{-} \right]}{\left[ BH \right]}=  ''K_{a}''&lt;/math&gt;
 Equation 4.&lt;/center&gt;


You should note two things in this equation; the term for water does not appear (remember, solids and liquids are ''never'' written in equilibrium expressions) and the equilibrium constant for ''K''&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is written as '''''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; '''to denote that this is an ''acid dissociation equilibrium.'' Now, as we learned in Chapter 8, a strong acid is “fully dissociated”, which simply means that [BH] is very, very small, thus ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; for a strong acid is very, very large. A weak acid is only “partially dissociated” which means that there are significant concentrations of both BH and B&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; in solution, thus ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; for a weak acid is “small”. For most common weak acids, the values for ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; will be in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt;. As an example, consider acetic acid (the acidic component of vinegar) where ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.8 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;.


&lt;center&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)'' &amp;#8644; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)''&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K_{a}=\frac{\left[ H_{3}O^{+} \right]\left[ CH_{3}COO^{-} \right]}{\left[ CH_{3}COOH \right]}=1.8\times 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;
 Equation 5.&lt;/center&gt;

A series of acids have the following ''K''a values: rank these in descending order from the ''strongest'' acid to the ''weakest'' acid.

At 60.0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; C, ''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; ''increases'' &lt;br&gt;to 1.00 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-13&lt;/sup&gt;. What is the ''p''H of a sample of pure water at 60.0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; C?

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''10.7 The ''p''H of Weak Acid Solutions'''==

For a solution of a strong acid, calculating the [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] concentration is simple; because the acid is 100% dissociated, the concentration of hydronium ions is equal to the molar concentration of the strong acid (this is, of course, only true for a monoprotic acid such as HCl or HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 2 &amp;times; [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;], etc.). For a weak acid, however, the hydronium ion concentration will be much, much less than the molar concentration of the acid and [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] must be calculated using the value of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. We can approach this using an ''ICE'' table, like we did for previous equilibrium problems. If we prepared a solution of acetic acid ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/10.7.html Figure 10.7])that was exactly 0.50 M, then ''initially'' [CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH] is 0.50 M and both [CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;] and [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] are zero. A small amount of CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH will ionize; let’s call this ''x'', making the ''change'' for [CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH] “-''x''”, increasing both [CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;] and [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] by the amount “+''x''”. Finally, the ''equilibrium'' concentration of [CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH] will be (0.50 M – ''x)'' and both [CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;] and [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] will be ''x''. The completed table is shown below.

The expression for ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; for acetic acid is given in Equation 5. Substituting for our equilibrium values:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K_{a}=1.8\times 10^{-5}=\frac{\left[ H_{3}O^{+} \right]\left[ CH_{3}COO^{-} \right]}{\left[ CH_{3}COOH \right]}=\frac{x^{2}}{0.50-x}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;or     x^{2}+9.0\times 10^{-6}x-1.8\times 10^{-5}=0&lt;/math&gt;
Equation 6.&lt;/center&gt;


Equation 6 is a quadratic equation and we could solve it using the standard quadratic formula. This is not necessary, however, because acetic acid is a ''weak acid'' and by definition, very little of the dissociated form will exist in solution, making the quantity ''x'' very, very small. If ''x'' is much, much less than 0.50 M (our initial concentration of acetic acid), then (0.50 M – ''x)''  0.50 M and Equation 6 simplifies to:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K_{a}=1.8\times 10^{-5}=\frac{\left[ H_{3}O^{+} \right]\left[ CH_{3}COO^{-} \right]}{\left[ CH_{3}COOH \right]}=\frac{x^{2}}{0.50}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;or     x=\left[ H_{3}O^{+} \right]=\sqrt{\left( 1.8\times 10^{-5} \right)\times 0.50}=3.0\times 10^{-3}M&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


We can test our assumption by substituting for ''x''; (0.50 – 0.0030'')'' = 0.497, which rounds to 0.50 to two significant figures. Because the concentration of hydronium ion is very small for a weak acid, for most typical solutions, the concentration of hydronium ion can be estimated simply as:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left[ H_{3}O^{+} \right]=\sqrt{K_{a}\times C_{0}}&lt;/math&gt;
 Equation 7.&lt;/center&gt;


where C&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the initial molar concentration of the weak acid.

 a) Nitrous acid (HNO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a weak acid with a ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of 4.3 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;. &lt;br&gt;Estimate the hydronium ion concentration and the ''p''H for a 0.50 M solution &lt;br&gt;of nitrous acid in distilled water. 

 b) Acetic acid is a weak acid with ''K&lt;sub&gt;a''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.8 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;. For a solution of &lt;br&gt;acetic acid in water, the [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] is found to be &lt;br&gt;4.2 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; M. What is the concentration of ''unionized'' acetic acid in this solution? 

&lt;center&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)'' &amp;#8644; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)''&lt;/center&gt;

 c) A solution is prepared in which acetic acid is 0.700 M and its conjugate base, &lt;br&gt;acetate anion is 0.600 M. As shown above, the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of acetic acid &lt;br&gt;is 1.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;; what will the ''p''H of this solution be?


[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex10.5.html ''' Exercise 10.5 Writing Equilibrium Expressions ''']

What concentration of the weak acid, acetic acid (''K&lt;sub&gt;a''&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.8 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;br&gt;must you have in pure water in order for the final pH to be 2.38?

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''10.8 Solubility Equilibria'''==

In Chapter 5 we learned about a class of reactions that involved the formation of a solid that was “insoluble” in water, and precipitated from the solution. In these “precipitation reactions”, one ionic salt was described as “insoluble”, driving the reaction towards the formation of products. Silver chloride is a classic example of this. If you mix silver nitrate (almost ''all'' nitrate salts are “soluble” in water) with sodium chloride, a copious white precipitate of silver chloride formed and the silver nitrate was deemed “insoluble” ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/10.8.html Figure 10.8]).

Nonetheless, if you took the clear solution from above the silver chloride precipitate and did a chemical analysis, there will be sodium ions, nitrate ions, and ''traces'' of chloride ions and silver ions. The concentrations of silver and chloride ions would be about 1.67 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; M, far below the concentrations we typically work with, hence we say that silver chloride is “insoluble in water”. That, of course, is not true. Solubility is an equilibrium in which ions leave the solid surface and go into solution at the same time that ions are re-deposited on the solid surface. For silver chloride, we could write the equilibrium expression as:

&lt;center&gt;AgCl''(s)'' &amp;#8644; Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)'' + Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)''&lt;/center&gt;


In order to write the expression for the equilibrium constant for this solubility reaction, we need to recall the rules stated in Section 10.2 of this chapter; Rule #4 states, “Reactants or products that are present as solids or liquids ''do not appear'' in the equilibrium expression.” Because silver chloride is a solid, the expression for the equilibrium constant is simply,

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K_{sp}=\left[ Ag^{+} \right]\left[ Cl^{-} \right]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;


Note that we have denoted the equilibrium constant as ''K''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;, where “sp” refers to solubility equilibrium, or “solubility product” (the product of the concentrations of the ions). We can calculate the value of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; for silver chloride from the analytical data that we cited above; an aqueous solution above solid silver chloride has a concentration of silver and chloride ions of 1.67 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; M, at 25˚ C. Because the concentrations of silver and chloride ions are both 1.67 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5 &lt;/sup&gt;M, the value of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; under these conditions must be:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K_{sp}=\left[ Ag^{+} \right]\left[ Cl^{-} \right]=\left( 1.67\times 10^{-5} \right)^{2}=2.79\times 10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


This is very small, considering that ''K''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; for sodium chloride is about 29! 

For a salt such as PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/10.9.html Figure 10.9]), chemical analysis tells us that the lead concentration in a saturated solution (the maximum equilibrium solubility under a specified set of conditions, such as temperature, pressure, etc.) is about 1.30 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; M. In order to calculate ''K''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; for lead (II) iodide, you must first write the chemical equation and then the equilibrium expression for ''K''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; and then simply substitute for the ionic concentrations. As you do this, remember that there are ''two'' iodide ions for every lead ion, therefore the concentrations for lead (II) and iodide are 1.30 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; M and 2.60 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; M, respectively.

&lt;center&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(s)'' &amp;#8644; Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)'' + 2 I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)''&lt;/center&gt;


&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;K_{sp}=\left[ Pb^{2+} \right]\left[ I^{-} \right]^{2}=\left( 1.30\times 10^{-3} \right)\left( 2.60\times 10^{-3} \right)^{2}=8.79\times 10^{-9}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''''Study Points'''''==

* If two opposing chemical reactions proceed simultaneously ''at the same rate,'' the processes are said to be in '''equilibrium'''. The two opposing reactions are shown linked with a double arrow (&amp;#8644;). An example of opposing chemical reactions and their equilibrium expressions are:

&lt;center&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' &amp;rarr; 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' and 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' &amp;rarr; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'':&lt;/center&gt;

The equilibrium would be written as: N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' &amp;#8644; 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)''

* An equilibrium constant (''K'') is a numerical value that relates the concentrations of the '''products''' and '''reactants''' for a chemical reaction that is at equilibrium. The numeric value of an equilibrium constant is '''independent of the initial concentrations of reactants''', but ''is'' dependent on the '''temperature'''. Equilibrium constants are ''generally'' not written with units (although they may be). 
* Because equilibrium constants are written as the concentrations (or partial pressures) of '''products''' divided by the concentrations (or partial pressures) of '''reactants''', a ''large'' value of ''K'' means that there are more products in the equilibrium mixture than there are products. Likewise, a ''small'' value of ''K'' means that, at equilibrium, there are more reactants than products. 
* Equilibrium constants that are based on '''partial pressures''' are often written as ''K''&lt;sub&gt;P&lt;/sub&gt;, while equilibrium constants based on '''molar concentrations''' are written as ''K''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;. 
* An expression for an equilibrium constant can be written from a balanced chemical equation for the reaction. '''The Law of Mass Action''' states the following regarding equilibrium expressions:
*# Partial pressures (or molar concentrations) of '''products''' are written in the '''numerator''' of the expression and the partial pressures (or concentrations) of the '''reactants''' are written in the '''denominator'''.
*# If there is more that one reactant or more that one product, the partial pressures (or concentrations) are ''multiplied'' together.
*# The partial pressure (or concentration) of each reactant or product is then '''raised to the power''' that numerically equals the '''stoichiometric coefficient''' appearing with that term in the balanced chemical equation.
*# Reactants or products that are present as '''solids''' or '''liquids''' ''do not appear ''in the equilibrium expression.

* As an example of an equilibrium expression, consider the reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen to form ammonia. The partial pressure of ammonia will be in the numerator, and it will be ''squared''. Because there are two reactants, the partial pressures for nitrogen and hydrogen will be ''multiplied'' in the denominator. The partial pressure of nitrogen will be raised to the “first power” (which is not shown) and the partial pressure of hydrogen will be ''cubed''.

&lt;center&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'' &amp;#8644; 2 NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ''(g)'': 
&lt;math&gt;\frac{\left( P_{NH_{3}} \right)^{2}}{P_{N_{2}}\left( P_{H_{2}} \right)^{3}}=K&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

* If equilibrium values for a given reaction are known, the equilibrium constant can be calculated simply by substituting those values in the equilibrium expression. Quite often, however, initial and equilibrium values are only given for selected reactants and products. In these cases, ''initial'' and ''equilibrium'' values are arranged in an '''''ICE'' Table''', and the ''changes'' between initial and equilibrium states are calculated based on reaction stoichiometry. 
* Because the '''partial pressure''' of a gas and the '''molar concentration''' of that gas are directly proportional, the ideal gas law can be rearranged as follows, to give an expression relating molarity and partial pressure of a gas.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;P_{gas}V=nRT&lt;/math&gt;; dividing by the volume in '''liters''' gives the term &lt;math&gt;\left( {}^{n}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{V_{liters}}\; \right)&lt;/math&gt; which is equivalent to ''molarity'', '''''M''''';&lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;or, &lt;math&gt;P_{gas}=MRT&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

* Le Chatelier's Principle states that, if a &quot;stress&quot; is applied to a chemical reaction at equilibrium, the system will readjust in the direction that best reduces the stress imposed on the system. In this context, ''stress'' refers to a change in '''concentration''', a change in '''pressure''' or a change in '''temperature''', although only concentration is considered here. If pressure or temperature are changed, the numeric value ''K'' will change; '''if only concentration changes are involved, ''K'' does ''not'' change'''. In a reaction at equilibrium, the introduction of more products will shift the mass balance towards more reactants, and the introduction of more reactants will lead to the formation of more products, but the ''ratio'' of ''Products/Reactants'' (as defined by the equilibrium expression) does ''not'' change, hence, ''K'' is unchanged. 

* For a '''weak acid''', dissociating in water to form it's '''conjugate base''' and '''hydronium''' ion, the equilibrium constant is referred to as ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;. Because a weak acid is only &quot;partially dissociated&quot;, the concentration of BH in solution is large, thus ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; for a weak acid is &quot;small&quot; (in the range of 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt;). For example, acetic acid (the acidic component of vinegar), has an acid dissociation constant of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;center&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)'' &amp;#8644; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)''&lt;/center&gt;

* For a solution of a ''weak acid ''in water, the concentration of hydronium ion will be ''very small.'' If the concentration of the weak acid is fairly large (typically &gt; 0.01 M) the concentration of the undissociated acid will be much larger than [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]. Because of this, the hydronium ion concentration (hence, the pH) can be fairly accurately estimated from the ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the weak acid and the initial concentration of the acid (C&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;), by the equation:

&lt;center&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left[ H_{3}O^{+} \right]=\sqrt{K_{a}\times C_{0}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

* The equilibrium constant defining the solubility of an ionic compound with low solubility is defined as ''K''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;, where “sp” refers to “solubility product”. Because reactants or products that are present as solids or liquids ''do not appear'' in equilibrium expressions, for silver chloride, the expression ''K''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; will be written as:

&lt;center&gt;AgCl''(s)'' &amp;#8644; Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)'' + Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)'' ; 
&lt;math&gt;K_{sp}=\left[ Ag^{+} \right]\left[ Cl^{-} \right]&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

* For silver chloride, the '''solubility''' at 25 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C is 1.67 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; M. That means the concentrations of silver and chloride ions in solution are ''each'' 1.67 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; M, making the value of ''K''&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt; under these conditions:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;K_{sp}=\left[ Ag^{+} \right]\left[ Cl^{-} \right]=\left( 1.67\times 10^{-5} \right)^{2}=2.79\times 10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

'''In today’s society, the term ''radioactivity'' conjures up a variety of images. Nuclear power plants producing hydrocarbon-free energy, but with potentially deadly by-products that are difficult to store safely. Bombs that use nuclear reactions to produce devastating explosions with horrible side effects on the earth as we know it and on the surviving populations that would inhabit it. Medical technology that utilizes nuclear chemistry to peer inside living things to detect disease and the power to irradiate tissues to potentially cure these diseases. Fusion reactors that hold the promise of limitless energy with few toxic side products. Radioactivity has a colorful history and clearly presents a variety of social and scientific dilemmas. In this chapter we will introduce the basic concepts of radioactivity, nuclear equations and the processes involved in nuclear fission and nuclear fusion.'''

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''11.1 Radioactivity'''==

The actual discovery of radioactivity is generally attributed to the French scientist, Henri Becquerel in 1896. As with most discoveries, he was working on something else. In this case it was the nature of phosphorescence; the property of some substances to “glow in the dark” after being exposed to light''.'' In the course of his work, he allowed photographic plates to come in contact with uranium salts, only to find out that the uranium had “fogged” the unexposed plates ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/11.1.html Figure 11.1]). Further work by Becquerel and others (including Marie Curie) led to the realization that certain elements spontaneously produced a variety of particles, some of which were charged (both positive and negative) and one class that was of higher energy, but appeared to be neutral. The three basic classes of particles were characterized and identified as “alpha”, “beta”, and “gamma” particles ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/11.2.html Figure 11.2]). Alpha particles were positive, relatively massive and, subsequent work showed that they were identical to the nucleus of the helium atom, containing two protons and two neutrons. Beta particles had a very small mass. They were of higher energy and they carried a negative charge; equivalent in mass and charge to an electron. Gamma particles (actually referred to as gamma rays) were much more energetic, appeared to be neutral and were comparable to a high-energy photon of light. Although it was not apparent immediately, one of the most surprising observations regarding radioactive elements was that as they emitted particles, the identity of the element slowly changed; uranium, for example, slowly became enriched with lead.

When alpha, beta or gamma particles collides with a target, some of the energy in the particle is transferred to the target, typically resulting in the promotion of an electron to an “excited state”. In many “targets”, especially gasses, this results in ''ionization'', and alpha, beta and gamma radiation is broadly referred to as '''ionizing radiation'''. A '''Geiger counter''' (or Geiger-Müller counter) takes advantage of this in order to detect these particles. In a Geiger tube, the electron produced by ionization of a captive gas travels to the anode and the change in voltage is detected by the attached circuitry. Most counters of this type are designed to emit an audible “click” in response to the change in voltage, and to also show it on a digital or analog meter. A simple schematic of a Geiger counter is shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/11.3.html Figure 11.3].


Today, we recognize that radioactive decay is actually quite complex, but the basic principles and patterns that were established over 100 years ago still stand. The three basic subatomic particles that occur in radioactive decay are the alpha particle, the beta particle and the gamma ray. The gamma ray is of highest energy (and perhaps the greatest ultimate danger), but from a chemistry standpoint, the alpha and beta particles are of the greatest interest. An alpha particle consists of two protons and two neutrons. It has a mass of four amu and a charge of +2. It is identical with the helium nucleus, and when a radioactive element emits an alpha particle, it loses four amu from its nucleus, including two protons ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/11.4.html Figure 11.4]). Because the number of protons in a nucleus define the identity of the element, the atomic number of the element decreases by ''two'' when it loses an alpha particle; thus uranium (&lt;math&gt;{}_{92}^{238}U&lt;/math&gt;) loses an alpha particle and becomes an atom of thorium (&lt;math&gt;{}_{90}^{234}Th&lt;/math&gt;); we will discuss this process further in the following section. In order for a beta particle (an electron) to emerge from the nucleus, it must be formed by the decomposition of a neutron (on a very simple scale, think of a neutron as being composed of a positive ''proton'' bound to a negative ''electron''). When a neutron decays and emits a beta particle, it leaves behind the newly formed proton. Again, this changes the identity of the element in question.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''11.2 The Nuclear Equation: Alpha Particle Emission'''==

In Chapter 1, we described the meaning of the '''atomic symbol''' for an element. In the atomic symbol, the '''atomic number''' (the number of protons in the nucleus) appears as a subscript ''preceding'' the symbol for the element. The '''mass number''' appears as a superscript, also preceding the symbol. Thus for uranium (atomic number 92) with a mass of 238, the symbol is &lt;math&gt;{}_{92}^{238}U&lt;/math&gt;. To show radioactive decay in a chemical equation, you need to use atomic symbols. Thus, for the loss of an alpha particle from &lt;math&gt;{}_{92}^{238}U&lt;/math&gt;, you need to show uranium on the “reactant” side of the equation and thorium and the alpha particle on the “product” side. Just like any other chemical equation, a nuclear equation must '''balance'''. The sum of the mass numbers on the reactant side must equal the sum of the mass numbers on the product side. Because we started with uranium-238 and lost four mass units in the alpha particle, the product (or products) of the decay must have a total mass of (238 – 4) = '''234'''. We have also removed two protons from the uranium nucleus, dropping the atomic number by two. The newly formed element is therefore thorium-234.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_{92}^{238}U&lt;/math&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;math&gt;{}_{2}^{4}He&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;{}_{90}^{234}Th&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

In this equation, we have shown the alpha particle using the atomic symbol for helium (&lt;math&gt;{}_{2}^{4}He&lt;/math&gt;), but this is often shown using the symbol &lt;math&gt;{}_{2}^{4}\alpha &lt;/math&gt; ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/11.5.html Figure 11.5]). Compounds that emit alpha particles are ''very'' toxic, in spite of the poor penetrating ability of the particle. This is especially true if the emitting element is inhaled or ingested. The toxic dose of the alpha-emitter &lt;math&gt;{}^{210}Po &lt;/math&gt; in a 175-pound person has been estimated to be about one microgram (1 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;-6 &lt;/sup&gt;g).


[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Examp11.1.html ''' Example 11.1  Writing Nuclear Equations''']

 '''Thorium-230''' and '''polonium-210''' both undergo loss of an alpha particle to &lt;br&gt;form different elements. For each of these radioactive decay processes, write &lt;br&gt;the appropriate nuclear equation and show the nature of the elements that are formed.


[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex11.1.html ''' Exercise 11.1  Writing Nuclear Equations''']

 Radium-226 and polonium-214 both undergo loss of an alpha particle to form &lt;br&gt;different elements. For each of these radioactive decay processes, write the &lt;br&gt;appropriate nuclear equation and show the nature of the elements that are formed.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''11.3 Beta Particle Emission'''==

In an element with an “excess” of neutrons, one of these neutrons can break down to form an electron and a proton. In this process, an ''antinutrino'' is also produced, but because it has no mass, it is generally ignored in this process. The nuclear equation for the decomposition of a neutron can be written:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_{0}^{1}n &lt;/math&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;math&gt;{}_{-1}^{0}\beta &lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;{}_{1}^{1}p &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

where the neutron has the symbol, &lt;math&gt;{}_{0}^{1}n &lt;/math&gt;, the proton has the symbol, &lt;math&gt;{}_{1}^{1}p &lt;/math&gt;, and the electron that is produced is called a '''beta particle''', with the symbol &lt;math&gt;{}_{-1}^{0}\beta &lt;/math&gt; ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/11.6.html Figure 11.6]). Because the nuclear equation must balance for mass and atomic numbers, the “atomic number” of the beta particle must be –1. Adding the atomic numbers on the right side of the equation shown above gives {(-1) + (+1) = 0}; identical to the “atomic number” in the neutron (&lt;math&gt;{}_{0}^{1}n &lt;/math&gt;); (even though a neutron can break down to ''produce'' a proton, there are no actual protons in a neutron, hence its atomic number is zero). Likewise, the “mass number” of the beta particle must be zero because the proton (the product) and the neutron (the reactant) each have a mass of one. Therefore, when a nucleus loses a beta particle, the number of neutrons in the nucleus decreases by one, but the mass number does not change; the neutron is converted into a proton, also having a mass number of one. Because the neutron is converted into a proton, the atomic number of the element ''increases'' by one unit, changing the identity of the element to the next highest in the periodic table. For example, thorium-234 undergoes loss of a beta particle to form pennsylvanium-234 by the equation shown below.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_{90}^{234}Th &lt;/math&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;math&gt;{}_{-1}^{0}\beta &lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;{}_{91}^{234}Pa &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Again, with a beta-particle emission, the mass number does not change, but the atomic number ''increases'' by one unit.

 '''Bismuth-210''' and '''lead-214''' both undergo loss of a beta particle to form &lt;br&gt;different elements. For each of these radioactive decay processes, write the &lt;br&gt;appropriate nuclear equation and show the nature of the elements that are formed.

 Chlorine-39 and strontium-90 both undergo loss of a beta particle to form different &lt;br&gt;elements. For each of these radioactive decay processes, write the appropriate &lt;br&gt;nuclear equation and show the nature of the elements that are formed.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''11.4 Positron Emission'''==

A '''positron''', also called an '''antielectron''', is an exotic bit of matter, or more correctly, an example of '''antimatter'''. A positron is the antimatter equivalent of an electron. It has the mass of an electron, but it has a charge of +1. Positrons are formed when a proton sheds its positive charge and becomes a neutron, as shown below. 

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_{1}^{1}p &lt;/math&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;math&gt;{}_{+1}^{0}\beta &lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;{}_{0}^{1}n &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Again, in the nuclear equation for positron emission, the sum of protons (atomic numbers) on the right equals the number of protons on the left and the masses all equal one. When an element emits a positron, the identity of the element changes to the one having one fewer protons on the periodic table. An example of a nuclear equation showing positron emission is shown below.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_{6}^{11}C &lt;/math&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;math&gt;{}_{+1}^{0}\beta &lt;/math&gt; + [&lt;math&gt;{}_{5}^{11}B &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Boron has one fewer protons in its nucleus than carbon, but the mass is unchanged because the proton has been replaced by a neutron.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_{9}^{18}F &lt;/math&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;math&gt;{}_{+1}^{0}\beta &lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;{}_{8}^{18}O &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Positron emission from Fluorine-18, as shown above , has become an important medical diagnostic tool; Positron Emission Tomography (a ''PET'' scan)([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/11.7.html Figure 11.7], [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/11.8.html Figure 11.8], [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/11.9.html Figure 11.9]). The heart of this technique is based on the fact that positrons undergo instant annihilation when they collide with an electron (an example of ''matter-antimatter annihilation''). When this occurs, two high-energy gamma rays are produced and exit the scene of the annihilation in exactly opposite directions. During a PET scan, a patient is given an injection containing fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), a sugar analog. The glucose analog is absorbed by metabolically active cells, where the FDG accumulates and undergoes positron decay. After a short waiting period, the patient is ''scanned'' using a circular array of gamma-radiation detectors. The fact that the gamma rays are emitted in opposite directions allows the attached computer to “draw a line” through the patient, where the line passes through the point of annihilation. Because this occurs through many directions, the exact location of the emission can be accurately calculated and then imaged as a three-dimensional picture showing the intensity of the emission.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''11.5 Radioactive Half-Life'''==

Elements such as &lt;math&gt;{}_{92}^{238}U&lt;/math&gt; that emit radioactive particles do so at rates that are ''constant'' and ''unique'' for each element. The rate at which an radioactive element decays is measured by its '''half-life'''&lt;nowiki&gt;; &lt;/nowiki&gt;the time it takes for one half of the radioactive atoms to decay, emitting a particle and forming a new element. Half-lives for elements vary widely, from billions of years to a few microseconds. On a simple, intuitive level, if you begin with 1.00 gram of a radioactive element, after one half-life there will be 0.500 grams remaining; after two half-lives, half of this has decayed, leaving 0.250 grams of the original element; after three half-lives, 0.125 grams would remain, etc. For those that prefer equations, the amount remaining after ''n'' half-lives can be calculated as follows:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;R=I\left( {}^{1}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{2}\; \right)^{n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Where '''''I''''' represents the initial mass of the element and '''''R''''' represents the mass remaining. For example, the half-life of Actinium-225 is 10.0 days. If you have a 1.00 gram sample of Actinium-225, how much is remaining after 60.0 days?

The number of half-lives is 6.00 (that is ''n'') and I = 1.00 gram. Substituting:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;R=\left( 1.00\text{ }gram \right)\left( {}^{1}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{2}\; \right)^{6.00}\text{;      }R=\left( 1.00\text{ }gram \right)\left( \text{0}\text{.0156} \right)\text{;     }R=\text{ 0}\text{.0156 }gram&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;


[http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/Ex11.3.html ''' Exercise 11.3  Radioactive Half-Life''']

 The half-life of Antimony-124 is 60.20 days. If you have a 5.00 gram sample of &lt;br&gt;Actinium, how much is remaining after 5.0 half-lives?

One of the interesting uses for half-life calculations involves radiocarbon dating, where the content of carbon-14 in organic (formally living matter) is used to calculate the age of a sample. The process begins in the upper atmosphere, where nitrogen is bombarded constantly by high-energy neutrons from the sun. Occasionally, one of these neutrons collides with a nitrogen nucleus and the isotope that is formed undergoes the following nuclear equation:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_{0}^{1}n&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;{}_{7}^{14}N&lt;/math&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;math&gt;{}_{1}^{1}p&lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;{}_{6}^{14}C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Plants take up atmospheric carbon dioxide by photosynthesis, and are ingested by animals, so every living thing is constantly exchanging carbon-14 with its environment as long as it lives. Once it dies, however, this exchange stops, and the amount of carbon-14 gradually decreases through radioactive decay with a half-life of about 5,730 years, following the nuclear equation shown below:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_{6}^{14}C&lt;/math&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;math&gt;{}_{-1}^{0}\beta &lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;{}_{7}^{14}N&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Thus, by measuring the carbon-14/carbon-12 ratio in a sample and comparing it to the ratio observed in living things, the number of half-lives that have passed since new carbon-14 was absorbed by the object can be calculated.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''11.6 Nuclear Fission'''==

The process by which nitrogen is converted to carbon-14 is an example of ''neutron capture'', in which particles are absorbed by the nucleus of another atom to form a new element. These types of reactions are actually quite common in nuclear chemistry. In [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/11.10.html Figure 11.10], a uranium-235 nucleus is shown capturing a “slow-moving” neutron, just like nitrogen captures a neutron, leading to the formation of carbon-14. Initially, uranium-236 is formed, but this nucleus has a neutron-to-proton ratio that makes it exceptionally unstable. The unstable nucleus instantaneously breaks apart (undergoes '''fission''') to form lighter elements and to release additional free neutrons. As the nucleus breaks apart, a significant amount of energy is also released. A nuclear equation showing a typical fission of uranium-235 is shown below:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_{92}^{235}\text{U}&lt;/math&gt;+ &lt;math&gt;{}_{0}^{1}\text{n}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;math&gt;{}_{56}^{141}\text{Ba}&lt;/math&gt;+ &lt;math&gt;{}_{36}^{92}\text{Kr}&lt;/math&gt; + 3 &lt;math&gt;{}_{0}^{1}\text{n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

The three neutrons that are released are now speeding through the mass of uranium. If these are captured by another nucleus, the process happens again and three more neutrons are released. This represents a ''chain reaction'', and in order to sustain a chain reaction like this, the mass or uranium must be large enough so that the probability of every released neutron being captured by another uranium is high. The mass of uranium (or other fissile element) that is required in order to sustain a chain reaction is called the '''critical mass'''. 

The process of nuclear fission is best known within the context of fission bombs and as the process that operates within nuclear power plants. Designing a workable fission bomb presents many technical challenges. A mass of fissile material that exceeds the critical mass is unstable, so you must begin with a smaller, non-critical mass and somehow create one within a few microseconds. In the original design, this was accomplished by taking two non-critical pieces and forcing them together (very rapidly). This is typically referred to as a “gun assembly”, in which one piece of fissile uranium is fired at a fissile uranium target at the end of the weapon, similar to firing a bullet down a gun barrel ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/11.1.html Figure 11.11'''A'''])

Each of the uranium fragments are less than a critical mass, but when they collide, they form a mass capable of sustaining the nuclear chain reaction. The assembly stays together for a few microseconds before the energy released from the fission blows it to pieces. The trick is designing nuclear devices like this is to keep them together long enough so that enough energy is released. Neutron reflectors and “boosters” are generally used to accomplish this, nonetheless, this basic type of weapon is inefficient, although easy to design and incredibly deadly. A critical mass of uranium-235 is a sphere that is slightly less than 7 inches in diameter.

A much more efficient fission bomb is based on achieving a critical mass of fissile material, not by combining smaller fragments, but by increasing the density of a sub-critical mass to the point that the rate of neutron capture sustains the chain reaction. This design is called the “implosion” bomb and it basically consists of a sphere of fissile material surrounded by shaped explosives that must be detonated simultaneously. The resulting shock wave compresses the fissile material, allowing the chain reaction to occur. This type of design requires much less fissile material, but is technically challenging. Modern devices, such as that shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/11.11.html Figure 11.11'''B'''], have neutron reflectors, “neutron initiators”, etc., and sophisticated bombs can be efficient, have a high yield and a relatively small physical size.

In a nuclear reactor designed to heat water, produce steam and electrical power, the chemistry is the same, but ''control rods'' are introduced between the pieces of fissile material to absorb some of the neutrons that are produced so that a critical mass is never achieved and the chain reaction can be controlled ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/11.12.html Figure 11.12]). In this set-up, as the control rods are withdrawn, the chain reaction speeds up, and as they are inserted, the reaction slows down. Even under “meltdown” conditions, where control rods fail, the critical mass of fissile material would be formed slowly. The resulting explosion would be a bad thing, but would not compare with the energy released from a well-designed fission weapon.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''11.7 Nuclear Fusion'''==

As we saw in the preceding section, when the nuclei of heavy atoms split, energy is released. For light atoms, the opposite is true; when these nuclei combine (fuse together), energy is released. This is the process of nuclear fusion. Fusion of light elements, mostly hydrogen, is the force that powers energy release in the sun and in sun-like stars. Imagine the sun as a huge sphere of hydrogen. Because a star is so massive, the gravitation pull on the hydrogen atoms is sufficient to overcome the repulsion between the two nuclei to force them together to form an unstable &lt;math&gt;{}_{2}^{2}\text{He}&lt;/math&gt; nucleus. This immediately ejects a positron, leaving deuterium, &lt;math&gt;{}_{1}^{2}\text{H}&lt;/math&gt;, and releasing a significant amount of energy. In the cascade of reactions shown in [http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/11.13.html Figure 11.13], deuterium fuses with another hydrogen to give &lt;math&gt;{}_{2}^{3}\text{He}&lt;/math&gt;, and two of these combine to form helium, ejecting two high-energy protons in the process.

In stars that are larger and heavier than our sun, the “triple alpha process” is the dominant nuclear reaction. In this, helium nuclei fuse to eventually form carbon, releasing significant energy in the process ([http://askthenerd.com/COL/images/11.14.html Figure 11.14]).

One of the great challenges in physics and engineering today is to replicate fusion of this sort under controlled conditions, harvesting the energy released and converting it, indirectly, into electrical power. The extremely high temperatures and pressures that are required to initiate and sustain fusion reactions thwarted, thus far, attempts to build a fusion reactor that is “break even” in terms of the energy released relative to the energy required to produce the fusion events. Uncontrolled fusion is certainly possible, and fusion bombs exist, but these typically use an advanced fission bomb to create the temperatures and pressures necessary to promote the fusion of the lighter elements. Clearly, this approach does not work in the laboratory! Work on fusion reactors continues at a fast pace and includes novel approaches such as ''aneutronic'' fusion reactions that utilize proton-boron fusion to produce charged particles rather than a barrage of neutrons. The advantage here is that few neutrons are produced, reducing the need for shielding, and the charged particles formed can potentially be captured ''directly'' as electricity.

== &amp;#160;&amp;#160;'''''Study Points'''''==

* In most atoms, a nucleus containing an “excess” of neutrons (more neutrons than protons) is unstable and the nucleus will decompose by '''radioactive decay''', in which particles are emitted until a stable nucleus is achieved. Common particles emitted during radioactive decay include:
*# '''Alpha particles''', consist of ''two protons'' and ''two neutrons.'' This is equivalent to a ''helium nucleus'' and an alpha particle has a charge of '''2+'''. Because it is positive, it will be attracted towards a negative charge in an electric field. The atomic symbol for an alpha particle is &lt;math&gt;{}_{2}^{4}He &lt;/math&gt;, or sometimes &lt;math&gt;{}_{2}^{4}\alpha &lt;/math&gt;. Alpha particles are slow-moving and are easily absorbed by air or a thin sheet of paper. When an element ejects an alpha particle, the identity of the element changes to the element with an atomic number that is ''two less'' than the original element. The mass number of the element ''decreases by four units.''
*# '''Beta particles''' are electrons, are considered to have negligible mass and have a ''single negative charge.'' They will be attracted towards a ''positive'' charge in an electric field. The atomic symbol for a beta particle is &lt;math&gt;{}_{-1}^{0}\beta &lt;/math&gt;, or sometimes &lt;math&gt;{}_{-1}^{0}e &lt;/math&gt;. Beta particles have “intermediate” energy and typically require thin sheets of metal for shielding. A beta particle is formed in the nucleus when a neutron “ejects” its negative charge (the beta particle) leaving a ''proton'' behind. When an element ejects a beta particle, the identity of the element changes to the ''next higher atomic number,'' but the mass number does not change.
*# '''Gamma particles''' (gamma rays) are high-energy photons. They have no mass and can be quite energetic, requiring thick shielding.
*# '''Positrons''' are anti-electrons, are considered to have negligible mass and have a ''single positive charge.'' They will be attracted towards a ''negative'' charge in an electric field. The atomic symbol for a positron is symbol &lt;math&gt;{}_{+1}^{0}\beta &lt;/math&gt;. Positrons have “intermediate” energy and typically require thin sheets of metal for shielding. A positron is formed in the nucleus when a proton “ejects” its positive charge (the positron) leaving a ''neutron'' behind. When an element ejects a positron, the identity of the element changes to the ''next lower atomic number'', but the mass number does not change.
* In a '''nuclear equation''', elements and sub-atomic particles are shown linked by a reaction arrow. When you balance a nuclear equation, the sums of the mass numbers and the atomic numbers on each side must be the same. 
* Radioactive elements decay at rates that are ''constant'' and ''unique'' for each element. The rate at which an radioactive element decays is measured by its '''half-life'''&lt;nowiki&gt;; &lt;/nowiki&gt;the time it takes for one half of the radioactive atoms to decay, emitting a particle and forming a new element. The amount of an original element remaining after ''n'' half-lives can be calculated using the equation:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;R=I\left( {}^{1}\!\!\diagup\!\!{}_{2}\; \right)^{n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Where '''''I''''' represents the initial mass of the element and '''''R''''' represents the mass remaining.

* In nuclear '''fission''', a nucleus captures a ''neutron'' to form an unstable intermediate nucleus, which then splits (undergoes fission) to give nuclei corresponding to lighter elements. Typically, ''neutrons'' are also ejected in the process. For heavy isotopes, the process of fission also releases a significant amount of energy. A nuclear equation for a classical fission reaction is shown below:

&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{}_{92}^{235}\text{U}&lt;/math&gt;+ &lt;math&gt;{}_{0}^{1}\text{n}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;math&gt;{}_{56}^{141}\text{Ba}&lt;/math&gt;+ &lt;math&gt;{}_{36}^{92}\text{Kr}&lt;/math&gt; + 3 &lt;math&gt;{}_{0}^{1}\text{n}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

* In nuclear '''fusion''', nuclei ''combine'' to form a new element. For light isotopes, the process of fusion also releases a significant amount of energy. A nuclear equation for the fusion cascade that typically occurs in stars the size of our sun is shown below:

&lt;center&gt;2 &lt;math&gt;{}_{1}^{1}p &lt;/math&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;math&gt;{}_{+1}^{0}\beta &lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;{}_{2}^{3}He &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

&lt;center&gt;2 &lt;math&gt;{}_{2}^{3}He &lt;/math&gt; &amp;rarr; 2 &lt;math&gt;{}_{1}^{1}p &lt;/math&gt; + &lt;math&gt;{}_{2}^{4}He &lt;/math&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I now provided a basis for the chapter, describing the goals of monetary policy. In particular the pernicious effects of inflation are described and why it is therefore a necessity for a central bank to keep inflation low. Because I am convinced that additional tweaks, with regard to both, content and language (might be a bit monotonous at some points), need to be made, I gave the page the status of 75% finished. If you have any points that are worth mentioning and were not mentioned by myself yet, edit them yourself or leave a post here, so that another person can deal with it.

Ambiguities may be minimized when recipes are primarily presented as formula or a series of baker percentages. Recipe weights are easily calculated therefrom, and a suggested weight can be supplied.  Volumetric measure may be calculated from those weights using density values, if volume and weight information for the ingredient is available. If so, then volumetric measurements can additionally be printed for folks who prefer that measurement system. Presenting recipes primarily as a series of baker percentages is an intuitive form that aids understanding.

In the above example, volumetric information for fresh yeast, also known as compressed yeast, is not available in the USDA Nutrient Data Laboratory, thus its density cannot be calculated from data that is provided.  The only leavening-yeast entry currently available with volume data is for active dry yeast.  According to a number of baking authors, including Gisslen, Figoni, Reinhart, Demuzio, and others, active dry yeast contains a significant percentage of dead yeast cells which release glutathione into the dough.  Varying yeast forms are often substituted for one another using conversion formulas, and while each form will act as a leaven, each substitution will also have its unique effects.

It's quite tempting to round the weights, particularly the value &quot;8.172&quot;.  Once such rounding occurs, backwards calculating the original baker percentage is impossible.  If more figures are rounded, then more ambiguities are introduced. In the conversion to volume, when density figures are available, it is also tempting to round the final result.  If the weights were first rounded, then those rounded figures were used to calculate volumes, themselves often also rounded, then backwards calculation of the baker's percentage formula becomes increasingly imprecise. 

While it's often said such precision isn't required in cooking, there are occasions when it is, such as very small inoculations of instant dry yeast intended for 16-18 hour pre-fermentation periods of small dough amounts such as a home baker might use.  Then it is useful to have a scale readable to 1/1000 of a gram. When using scales of 1/100 of a gram readability, the predicted time for final-dough creation versus actual pre-ferment completion time can vary too much, requiring more scheduling flexibility.

The USDA Nutritional database reports that an active dry yeast packet weighs 7.2 grams. A U.S. Customary teaspoon is about 4.93 mL in volume, so the formula was 4.93 mL*2.25 ≈ 11.09 mL as the recipe minimum volume, and 7.2 g ÷ 11.09 mL ≈ .649 g/mL = density.  Alternatively, the USDA nutritional database reports that a tablespoon of active dry yeast weighs 12 grams, so 7.2g ÷ 12g = 0.6 is a ratio based on tablespoon weight. A U.S. customary tablespoon is about 14.79 mL in volume, so  14.79 mL * 0.6 = 8.874 mL per active dry yeast packet. Further, 8.874 mL ÷ 4.93 mL = 1.8 U.S. Customary teaspoons per packet.  Weight of packet is 7.2g, so 7.2g ÷ 8.874mL ≈ 0.811 g/mL (density).  Thus, when a value of 1.8 U.S. Customary teaspoons are used for an active dry yeast packet volume, the maximum and minimum densities for active dry yeast are roughly equivalent.&lt;/ref&gt;

Values greater than 2% instant dry yeast are probably excessive with typical salt and moderately-high sugar levels. The maximum value appears largely caused by the recipe author's defined 15 mL teaspoon.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Analysis steps leading to results====

Entire ingredient text as analyzed, sequential order intact:

* ½ cup plus 1 tablespoon (125 ml plus 15 ml) brown sugar
* 2 packages dry (2 1/4 teaspoons, 35 ml) yeast
* 1 cup (250 ml) warm water
* 1 cup (250 ml) warm milk
* 5-6 cups (1.25-1.5 l) whole wheat flour - there is no white flour in this recipe.
* 2 teaspoons (30 ml) salt
* ⅓ cup (80 ml) oil

1) Separated yeast proofing sugar to its own line, also
deleted &quot;- there is no white flour....&quot; due to its ambiguity.  Since whole wheat flour is about 83% white flour (endosperm), inclusion of the phrase implies the ingredient &quot;whole wheat flour&quot; may only contain bran and germ.  Presumably the author meant products labeled as &quot;white flour&quot;, and if so, the phrase isn't needed.

* ½ cup (125 ml) brown sugar
* 1 tablespoon (15 ml) brown sugar
* 2 packages dry (2 1/4 teaspoons, 35 ml) yeast
* 1 cup (250 ml) warm water
* 1 cup (250 ml) warm milk
* 5-6 cups (1.25-1.5 l) whole wheat flour....
* 2 teaspoons (30 ml) salt
* ⅓ cup (80 ml) oil

2) Rearranged sequential order.

* 5-6 cups (1.25-1.5 l) whole wheat flour....
* 1 cup (250 ml) warm water
* 1 cup (250 ml) warm milk
* ½ cup (125 ml) brown sugar
* ⅓ cup (80 ml) oil
* 1 tablespoon (15 ml) brown sugar
* 2 teaspoons (30 ml) salt
* 2 packages dry (2 1/4 teaspoons, 35 ml) yeast

3) Began analysis line-by-line.  This recipe appears to use 250 mL cups.  
* 5-6 cups (1.25-1.5 l) whole wheat flour....
* 1 cup (250 ml) warm water
* 1 cup (250 ml) warm milk
* ½ cup (125 ml) brown sugar
Packed versus unpacked brown sugar is unspecified, thus large variance in density exists. 

* ⅓ cup (80 ml) oil
Minor rounding occurs between &quot;1/3 cup (80 mL)&quot; and actual value of 83 mL (250/3).  The different values were used for maximum and minimum volumes.

* 1 tablespoon (15 ml) brown sugar
This recipe seems to use 15 mL tablespoons. Packed versus unpacked is unspecified, thus large variance in density exists.

* 2 teaspoons (30 ml) salt
This seems to define a teaspoon of 15 mL

* 2 packages dry (2 1/4 teaspoons, 35 ml) yeast
This line seems to have multiple ambiguities. Parenthetical has seemed to consistently indicate total. Max. teaspoon: 2.25 * 15 (author's defined teaspoon of 15 mL)= 33.75, not 35 mL; each packet of yeast is commonly said to contain 2.25 teaspoons, but 2 packets are specified; and the dry yeast identification is missing.  Could it be osmotolerant dry yeast?
Min. tsp 2.25 * 4.93 (US Customary, smallest) 

4) Looked up standard reference values, entered all data in spreadsheet, and calculated the results as minimum-maximum ranges.  The two brown sugar lines were re-combined into one line to reflect total brown sugar used, though this does eliminate the separate weight and baker's percentage to use for proofing the yeast.

5) Formatted results as table for presentation.

====Observations====

In the Cookbook:Whole-Wheat Bread recipe, a baker who uses cup and spoon measurements without paying attention to their precise volumetric size is likely to get vastly different results than another who prefers milliliter measures.  A baker who uses weight measure isn't helped at all, and may not wish to spend the time to lookup density values, which aren't easy to find, to calculate the weights, and when they do, they may find ambiguity. As the wide ranges from minimum to maximum show, the typical way in which some recipes are presented leads to imprecise measurement, and thus likely inconsistent baking results. If one didn't know how to calculate the conversions on any similar recipe (it's easy, but time consuming), one could bake for many years and still wonder why results were different each time. Backwards calculating from volumetric values to bakers' or formula percentages is inherently problematic due to ambiguities in the variety of volume systems that exist, numerical and ingredient rounding that may exist, as well as simple errors.

The linux.img is no longer available via the QEMU dowloads page.

Is this correct? two large chunks of beef per serving if 20 serves 10. Is this because it's one dish among many served at a group meal? I know zip but thought I'd ask.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===L'Hopital's Rule===

This is a really fun rule to deal with.  As explained in a different section the way you have learned to deal with fractional limits is by factoring.  L'Hopital's Rule is a much easier way to deal with these fractional limit functions.  

&lt;p&gt;When you use this rule you must first prove that you get an indeterminate form when evaluating the limit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indeterminate form can come in a variety of different ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Indeterminate forms:''' &lt;math&gt;\frac {0}{0}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac {\infty}{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 * \infty&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac {- \infty}{- \infty}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\infty - \infty&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac {- \infty}{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac {\infty}{- \infty}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0^0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1^{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\infty^{0}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of them, but the more you work with them and become familiar with these indeterminate forms they will be committed to memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Ex: 1'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Show that the limit is in an indeterminate form&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0} \frac {x^2}{x}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next step to L'Hopital's Rule is to look at the fraction as &lt;math&gt;\frac {f(x)}{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As long as &lt;math&gt;g(x) \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; you can use L'Hopital's Rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The formula for L'Hopital's Rule is &lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c} \frac {f(x)}{g(x)}&lt;/math&gt; as long as f and g are differentiable on the open interval (a,b)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Ex: 2'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determine if you can use L'Hopital's Rule. If you can then evaluate the limit using L'Hopital's Rule.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to 0} \frac {3x^3 - x}{x - 5}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will notice when trying to evaluate some limits using L'Hopital's Rule that the function just switches back and forth.  When this happens you will probably have multiply a variable into the function, as long as it equals one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Ex: 3'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determine if you can use L'Hopital's Rule.  If you can then evaluate the limit using L'Hopital's Rule&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac {\sqrt {x}}{\sqrt {x+1}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''Solution to Ex: 3'''&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac {\sqrt {x}}{\sqrt {x+1}} = \frac {\infty}{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac {\frac{1}{2 * \sqrt{x}}}{\frac {1}{2 * \sqrt{x+1}}} =\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac {\sqrt{x + 1}}{\sqrt{x}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac {\frac {1}{2* \sqrt{x+1}}}{\frac {1}{2* \sqrt{x}}} = \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac {\sqrt {x}}{\sqrt {x+1}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see we are getting no where fast.  Something else needs to be done&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac {\sqrt {x}}{\sqrt {x+1}} * \frac {\frac {1}{x^2}}{\frac {1}{x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac {\sqrt {\frac {x}{x}}}{\sqrt {\frac {x}{x} + \frac {1}{x}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac {1}{\sqrt {1 + \frac {1}{x}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{\sqrt {1 + \frac {1}{\infty}}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{\sqrt {1 + 0}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

== A PROPOSAL WHICH MIGHT GIVE A BIG MOMENTUM TO WIKIBOOKS ==

There is a webpage called  [http://www.freescience.info '''Free-Science'''] which has over 2000 files a considerable percentage of which are serious/well written science books which are put to internet by their authors. These books are free of charge however this doesn't mean of course the content is open though I assume some of the content has Wikibooks compatible licence. My point is if we can contact authors for permission to export their books to wikibooks with a wiki compatible licence, Wikibooks can gain a huge momentum I think.[[User:Condmatstrel|Condmatstrel]] ([[User talk:Condmatstrel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Condmatstrel|contribs]]) 12:50, 1 April 2011 (UTC)

:Just so you don't feel ignored :), I didn't knew that site, some of the works available are very interesting. Sadly the licenses and copyrights aren't clear at least before you get some of the works. Added to my todo list , thanks...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 04:42, 2 April 2011 (UTC)

== American English/British English ==

The English Wikibooks should probably be split into American English and British English Wikibookses.  It would resolve the multifarious vicious conflicts regarding this. --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:17, 2 April 2011 (UTC)
:That's not how even en Wikipedia works, where the conflict is much greater and there are sufficient editors to handle all the additional work that would be created by having two projects. If we did it here we'd end up with even less content I think. A nice gadget that translated from one to the other based on user preferences would be great, if somewhat technically challenging. Or maybe just label each book as &quot;Written in XXXX English&quot; so at least the reader knows and then use an associated category so the books can be sorted according to language. Generally speaking I only change between British and US English where both are mixed up badly in one page of one book. Other than that I just leave it alone. I don't know how many other people even bother trying to be consistent and personally I don't think it matters that much, I've just got OCD for tidiness. It'll be interesting to see what other people think &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 07:04, 2 April 2011 (UTC)
::I think it doesn't really matter if you mix the two. Afterall, what about Australian, New Zealandic, Canadian, and South African English as well? If you don't know a word in another dialect, use wiktionary. Obviously to look consistant we should try our best to keep books in their respective dialects, but if you are an American contributing to a section of a book written in British English, I don't see why there should be any serious conflict writing &quot;color&quot; instead of &quot;colour&quot;. Afterall, there isn't a British English Wikipedia nor an AMerican English WIkipedia and you can find articles written in both dialects in a mix. --[[User:Girdi|Girdi]] ([[User talk:Girdi|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Girdi|contribs]]) 08:54, 2 April 2011 (UTC)
:::I agree and it has been so, as far as I know. You can specify (by proposing and adopting) a specific preference in a given work. This not only makes it clear to editors but will avoid conflicts if you do implement a standard. I have done so in some of the works I do contribute, not only on language but on the use of hyphenation for instance, I find that this makes life easier for all especially in lengthy and complex works that wouldn't be possible or consistent without establishing this simple conventions.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 10:03, 2 April 2011 (UTC)

:Should book contributors agree, an [[Help:Editnotices|editnotice]] can be set up to appear when editing any page of the book detailing the version of English being used.  I set this up for the contributors to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter]]; try editing a page in it and see the [[Template:Editnotice#Examples|example]] on the template that implements it.  Beyond that, we saw what happened with Simple English Wikibooks&amp;mdash;it was closed and mostly merged here.  The Foundation will also not approve any new English variant wikis.  Redcoats and Yankees will just have to get along. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 12:42, 2 April 2011 (UTC)
== Bot, gadget or tool for dewikification ==

It would be great to have a bot, gadget or tool that simplifies the dewikification process by handling simple tasks such as delinking, removing Wikipedia-specific templates, and replacing Wikipedia templates such as {{tl|ndash}} with the actual characters (–).

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Trigonometric Integrals===

There are a few different types of integrals using trigonometric functions.  I will split it into a few different sections.  Those involving sine, cosine, and tangent.  From there I will cover cotangent, secant, and cosecant.  Then I will cover the inverse functions, functions involving e, ln, and finally hyperbolic functions.  

&lt;p&gt;Something to keep in mind is that the variable used in these functions are denoted by &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.  (see substitution section)&lt;/p&gt;

===&lt;math&gt;\sin u&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\cos u&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\tan u&lt;/math&gt;===

&lt;math&gt;\int \sin u \operatorname {d}u = - \cos u + C&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \cos u \operatorname {d}u = \sin u + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \tan u \operatorname {d}u = - \ln \left \vert \cos u \right \vert + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \sin^2 u \operatorname {d} u = \frac {1}{2}(u - \sin u \cos u) + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \cos^2 u \operatorname {d} u = \frac {1}{2}(u + \sin u \cos u) + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \tan^2 u \operatorname {d}u = -u + \tan u + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt; \int \sin^k u \operatorname {d}u = - \frac{\sin^{k-1}u \cos u}{k} + \frac {k-1}{k}  \int \sin^{k-2} u \operatorname {d}u &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \cos^k u \operatorname {d}u = \frac{\cos^{k-1} u \sin u}{k} + \frac {k-1}{k} \int \cos^{k-2} u \operatorname {d}u&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \tan^k u \operatorname {d}u = \frac {\cos^{k-1} u \sin u}{k} + \frac {k-1}{k} \int \cos^{k-2} u \operatorname {d}u&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int u \sin u \operatorname {d}u = \sin u - u \cos u + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int u \cos u \operatorname {d}u = \cos u + u \sin u + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int u^k \sin u \operatorname {d}u = -u^k \cos u + k \int u^{k-1} \cos u \operatorname {d}u&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int u^k \cos u \operatorname {d}u = u^k \sin u - k \int u^{k-1} \sin u \operatorname {d}u&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \frac {1}{1 \pm \sin u} \operatorname {d}u = \tan u \pm \sec u + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \frac {1}{1 \pm \cos u} \operatorname {d}u = - \cot u \pm \csc u + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{1 \pm \tan u} \operatorname {d}u = \frac {1}{2} (u \pm \ln \left \vert \cos u \pm \sin u \right \vert) + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \frac {1}{\sin u \cos u} \operatorname {d}u = \ln \left \vert \tan u \right \vert + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

===&lt;math&gt;\cot u&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\sec u&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\csc u&lt;/math&gt;===

&lt;math&gt;\int \cot u \operatorname {d}u = \ln \left \vert \sin u \right \vert + C&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \sec u \operatorname {d}u = \ln \left \vert \sec u + \tan u \right \vert + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \csc u \operatorname {d}u = \ln \left \vert \csc u - \cot u \right \vert + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \sec^k u \operatorname {d}u = \frac {\sec^{k-2} u \tan u}{k-1} + \frac {k-2}{k-1} \int \sec^{k-2} u \operatorname {d}u, l \neq 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \csc^k u \operatorname {d}u = - \frac {\csc^{k-2} u \tan u}{k-1} + \frac {k-2}{k-1} \int \csc^{k-2} u \operatorname {d}u, k /neq 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \frac {1}{1 \pm \sec u} \operatorname {d}u = u + \cot u \mp \csc u + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \frac {1}{1 \pm \csc} \operatorname {d}u = u - \tan u \pm \sec u + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

===Inverse Trig Functions===

&lt;math&gt;\int \arcsin u \operatorname {d}u = u \arcsin u + \sqrt {1 - u^2} + C&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \arccos u \operatorname {d}u = u \arccos u - \sqrt {1 - u^2} + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \arctan u \operatorname {d}u = u \arctan u - \ln \sqrt {1 + u^2} + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \arccot u \operatorname {d}u = u \arccot u + \ln \sqrt {1 + u^2} + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \arcsec u \operatorname {d}u = u \arcsec u + \ln \left \vert u + \sqrt {u^2 -1} \right\vert + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int ]arccsc u \operatorname {d}u = u \arccsc u + \ln \left \vert u + \sqrt {u^2 - 1} \right \vert + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

===&lt;math&gt;e^u&lt;/math&gt;===

&lt;math&gt;\int e^u \operatorname {d}u = e^u + C&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int u e^u \operatorname {d}u = (u-1)e^u + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int u^k e^u \operatorname {d}u = k \int u^{k-1} e^u \operatorname {d}u&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \frac {1}{1 + e^u} \operatorname {d}u - u - \ln (1 + e^u) + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int e^{au} \sin bu \operatorname {d}u = \frac {e^{au}}{a^2 + b^2} (a \sin bu - b \cos bu) + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int e^{au} \cos bu \operatorname {d}u = \frac {e^{au}}{a^2 + b^2}(a \cos bu + b \sin bu) + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

===&lt;math&gt;\ln u&lt;/math&gt;===

&lt;math&gt;\int ]ln u \operatorname {d}u = u(-1 + \ln u) + C&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int u \ln u \operatorname {d}u = \frac {u^2}{4}(-1 + 2 \ln u) + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int u^k \ln u \operatorname {d}u = \frac {e^{au}}{a^2 + b^2}(a \cos bu + b \sin bu) + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int (\ln u)^2 \operatorname {d}u = u [2 -2 \ln u + (\ln u)^2] + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int (\ln u)^k \operatorname {d}u = u (\ln u)^k - k \int (\ln u)^{k-1} \operatorname {d}u&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

===Hyperbolic Functions===

&lt;math&gt;\int \cosh u \operatorname {d}u = \sinh u + C&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \sinh u \operatorname {d}u = \cosh u + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \operatorname {sech}^2 u \operatorname {d}u = \tanh u + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \operatorname {csch}^2 u \operatorname {d}u = - \coth u + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \operatorname {sech} u \tan u \operatorname {d}u = - \operatorname {sech}u + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int \operatorname {csch}u \coth u \operatorname {d}u = - \operatorname {csch}u + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

== Chess book ==

Hi! I saw you editing some chess pages. I've been wanting to improve the [[Chess]] book, and especially revamp the endgame page, but it's hard to do it on one's own. Do you play chess? If so, maybe I could get your thoughts on [[Talk:Chess/The Endgame#Subsections?|my suggestion]] to split the endgame section into further subsections for each piece vs. piece study? I'm hesitant to do it without any outside opinion because it's a big change. Cheers, [[User talk:Tempodivalse#top|'''''Tempodivalse''''']] 01:12, 12 January 2011 (UTC)

==American/British English (in [[Trigonometry]])==

Hi Whoop-Whoop.  I too think that the Trigonometry book should be in American English, not British English, so moving in that direction is good.  However, comments like &quot;Quit talking like a whole shitload of Brits!&quot; are not.  Please read [[Wikibooks:Editorial_Control]] especially the last two sentences.  I've added a section in the [[Talk:Trigonometry]] page so that we waste less time on agreeing on such things as British or American English.--[[User:JamesCrook|JamesCrook]] ([[User talk:JamesCrook|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/JamesCrook|contribs]]) 10:41, 15 January 2011 (UTC)

:Okay.  Sorry about the edit summary, I just got angry about the other editor continually reverting it back to British English, and I apparently carelessly vented my feelings through the edit summary.  Sorry about that. --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:56, 15 January 2011 (UTC)

== Tags ==

Tags such as {{tl|move}} should be placed on the content page for the page in question, as they then link to the corresponding discussion page for comments. And since they're on a content page and not a talk page, they should then not be substituted (commonly it's only templates on user talk pages that are substituted as well). &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 17:10, 17 January 2011 (UTC)

== Yet another help request ;) ==

Hi! I've wrote Croatian Chess book, placed it in Public Domain, and uploaded it at WikiMedia Commons here: [http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=File%3ACroatian_chess_2nd_ed.pdf&amp;page=1 Croatian_chess_2nd_ed.pdf]. Local admin, [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]], suggested that you might be willing to wikify it, and, if so, I'd really appreciate it. TIA!

:I'd really like to, but, unfortunately, I'm not really multilingual (just English and some Spanish,) and I can't understand Croatian.  Sorry! :-( [[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 22 February 2011 (UTC)

== Muggles' Guide ==

Hello, and thank you for the work you are doing on the Muggles' Guide.

I hope you'll forgive me for pointing this out, but there is a very important step that has to be done when you move a page, and that is to correct all the article links that point to it. There are about a dozen articles that point to &quot;Darkness Powder&quot;, that now must be edited to point to &quot;Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder&quot;. The most useful tool when doing this is in the toolbox on the lower left of the page, the &quot;What Links Here&quot; tool. If you go to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Peruvian Instant Darkness Powder]] and click &quot;What Links Here&quot;, you'll see the original page, now marked as a redirect page, and below that the dozen or so articles that point to the redirect.

Once you have made those changes, you can mark the original (now redirect) page for speedy deletion; the topic is obscure enough that I doubt there are inbound links pointing to it.

I will mention that when I originally created that page, I wondered whether I should use the full name or the abbreviated version, and ended up settling on the abbreviated version because my fingers were getting a bit weary... [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 17:17, 3 April 2011 (UTC)

:OK, I fixed the links and nominated it for speedy deletion.  YEE-HAW! --[[User:Whoop whoop pull up|Whoop whoop pull up]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Whoop whoop pull up|Bitching Betty]] | [[Special:Contributions/Whoop whoop pull up|Averted crashes]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:29, 3 April 2011 (UTC)

::And that looks like that's done it. No apparent broken links, and our incredibly efficient admins have already removed the redirect page.

::In case you're wondering about the collection thing, if you go to [[Muggles'  Guide to Harry Potter/All pages]] and select &quot;Related changes&quot; from the toolbox, you'll see every change that has been made to the Muggles' guide. The collection is the list of pages that make up the book... and there are a few other control pages included in that. You could print the entire book by printing the collection... but what I use it for is to track what changes have occurred in the Muggles' Guide, so I can cast an editorly eye over everything. Not that it's needed in most cases. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:14, 4 April 2011 (UTC)

Hello, I have looked at what you are doing and I think you have misunderstood the requirement. It is not sufficient to just provide a link to the Wikipedia article you copied the material from. That is ref [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/carbohydrate] ref  is not good enough. You need to provide a link to the version of the Wikipedia article you copied. So, in Wikipedia, you need to select &quot;Permanent link&quot; from the tool box to get a URL that is unique to the version you copied, then use that in the Wikibooks page like this example:  ref [ http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carbohydrate&amp;oldid=424717553] ref .

      <comment>/* What does the {{SUBPAGENAME}} look like? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">After food goes through the digestive system, the parts that are not digested need to be gotten rid of. That is the job of the excretory system.

__TOC__
==What does the {{SUBPAGENAME}} look like?==

==What are the parts of the {{SUBPAGENAME}}?==

The excretory system includes the kidneys, long tubes called ureters, and the bladder which stores urine until it leaves the body. 

Even the liver and skin play a role in the excretory system and removing waste, although they are also part of other systems.

==What is the function of the {{SUBPAGENAME}}?==

Unabsorbed food goes to the large intestine. The liver also filters out solid particles of waste from the blood. These solid wastes are removed from the body through the rectum, which is at the end of the large intestine.

Liquid wastes are filtered by the kidneys, a part of the excretory system. The kidneys have long tubes coming out of them called ureters that drain liquid into the bladder. The bladder stores liquid waste called urine until it is passed out of the body through the urethra.

==How does the {{SUBPAGENAME}} interact with other parts of the body?==

The excretory system takes food from the digestive system and removes the waste. Wastes are also filtered from blood in the body. Sweat contains waste that is put out through the skin.

==How can you keep your {{SUBPAGENAME}} healthy?==

Eating well and drinking plenty of water keeps the excretory system. Eating enough fiber, which is found in fresh fruits and vegetables, will make sure that your system stays healthy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When graphing the inverse trigonometric functions, we run into a problem. Functions may only have one output for each input. We do not encounter this problem in ordinary trigonometric functions. For example, 

sin(θ)=x°, in which any value of theta(θ) will have exactly one output, x degrees. Note that occasional inputs of the sine function will yield the same output. For instance,

sin(90)=sin(450)=sin(810)=1

Both the sin and cosine will yield the the same output after 360 degrees, or 2π in radians, is added to the input. The other four functions (tan, cot, sec, csc) have the same output after an addition of 180° or π. 

Keep in mind that this keeps with the definition of a function, in which every input has only one output, even if the output may be the same for different input. This is not true with the inverse trig functions!

arcsin(1)={90, 450, 810,... , 90+ n·360} and so on. Therefore, the general consensus is to simply define the domain(input) of arcsin between -90° to 90°, or -π/2 to π/2. Likewise, tangent is also defined this way. Cosine, on the other hand, has its domain defined between 0 and π. 

This can be seen most easily with a calculator. 

The arcsin(1)={90+n·360} where n is any integer value. However, the calculator will only display the &quot;accepted&quot; values between -90° and 90°. Likewise,

arccos(1)={n·360}. As before, the calculator will display only the accepted values between 0° and 180°.

[[File:Quadratic Golden Mean Siegel Disc IIM.png|right|thumb|Julia set drawn by inverse iteration of critical orbit ( in case of Siegel disc )]]
[[File:Parabolic_rays_landing_on_fixed_point.ogv|right|thumb|Periodic external rays of dynamic plane made with backward iteration]]
'''Iteration''' in mathematics refer to the process of iterating a function i.e. applying a function repeatedly, using the output from one iteration as the input to the next.&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Iteration|wikipedia : Iteration]]&lt;/ref&gt; Iteration of apparently simple functions can produce complex behaviours and difficult problems. 




One can make inverse ( backward iteration) :
* of repeller for drawing Julia set ( IIM/J)&lt;ref&gt;[http://facstaff.unca.edu/mcmcclur/class/FractalILS/JuliaSets.pdf Inverse Iteration Algorithms for Julia Sets by Mark McClure]&lt;/ref&gt;
* of circle outside Jlia set (radius=ER) for drawing level curves of escape time ( which tend to Julia set)&lt;ref&gt;[http://delta.cs.cinvestav.mx/~mcintosh/comun/julia/node3.html Complex iteration by Microcomputadoras ]&lt;/ref&gt;
* of circle inside Julia set (radius=AR) for drawing level curves of attract time ( which tend to Julia set)&lt;ref&gt;[https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.em/1045759519| On rational maps with two critical points by John Milnor, fig. 5]&lt;/ref&gt;
* of critical orbit ( in Siegel disc case) for drawing Julia set ( probably only in case of Goldem Mean )
* [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/Julia_set#backwards_iteration|for drawing external ray]]


Repellor for forward iteration is attractor for backward iteration

=Iteration =

=Test=
One can iterate ad infinitum. Test tells when one can stop

* bailout test for forward iteration

=Target set or trap =

[[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Target_set|Target set]] is used in test. When zn is inside target set then one can stop the iterations.

=Planes=
== Dynamic plane &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; for c=0 ==

Lets take c=0, then one can call dynamical plane &lt;math&gt;f_0&lt;/math&gt; plane. 

Here dynamical plane can be divided into :
* Fatou set
* Julia set = &lt;math&gt; \{  z : |z| = 1 \} &lt;/math&gt;

Fatou set consist from 2 subsets :
* interior of Julia set = basin of attraction of finite attractor = &lt;math&gt; \{  z : |z| &lt; 1 \} &lt;/math&gt;
* exterior of Julia set = basin of attraction of infinity = &lt;math&gt; \{  z : |z| &gt; 1 \} &lt;/math&gt;

===Forward iteration ===
 [[File:ExponentielleComplexe Puissances2.png|right|thumb|The 10 first powers of a complex number inside the unit circle]]
[[File:Exponentia spirals.svg|right|thumb|Exponential spirals ]]

&lt;math&gt;z = r e^{i \theta} \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;r = | z | \,&lt;/math&gt;

so 

&lt;math&gt;f_0(z) = z^2 = (r e^{i \theta})^2 = r^2  e^{i 2 \theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;

and forward iteration :&lt;ref&gt;[[nyjm.albany.edu/j/2010/16-29v.pdf|Real and imaginary parts of polynomial iterates by  Julia A. Barnes, Clinton P. Curry and Lisbeth E. Schaubroeck. New York J. Math. 16 (2010) 749–761.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f^n_0(z) =  r^{2^n}  e^{i 2^n \theta}\,&lt;/math&gt;

Forward  iteration gives forward orbit  = '''list of points''' {z0, z1, z2, z3... , zn} which lays on exponential spirals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarku.edu/~djoyce/complex/powers.html Complex numbers by David E Joyce]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suitcaseofdreams.net/powers_complex.htm Powers of complex numbers from Suitcase of Dreams ]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Escape test ====
 

If distance between point z of exterior of Julia set and Julia set is :
 
 &lt;math&gt;distance(z, J_c) = 2^{-n} &lt;/math&gt;

then point escapes  ( measured using [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Bailout_test|bailout test]] and [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/Julia_set#Basin_of_attraction_to_infinity_.3D_exterior_of_filled-in_Julia_set_and_The_Divergence_Scheme_.3D_Escape_Time_Method_.28_ETM_.29|escape time]] )

 &lt;math&gt;|z_n| &gt; ER &lt;/math&gt;

after :
* &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; steps in non-parabolic case
* &lt;math&gt;2^n&lt;/math&gt; steps in [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/parabolic|parabolic case]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0505036 Parabolic Julia Sets are Polynomial Time Computable by Mark Braverman]&lt;/ref&gt;

See here for [[Fractals/Mathematics/Numerical#Escaping_test|the precision needed for escape test]]

===Backward iteration ===

Every angle α ∈ R/Z measured in turns has :
* one image = 2α mod 1 under [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Doubling_map|doubling map]]
* &quot;two preimages under [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Doubling_map|the doubling map]]: α/2 and (α + 1)/2.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.math.tamu.edu/~nekrash/Preprints/filling.pdf SYMBOLIC DYNAMICS AND SELF-SIMILAR GROUPS by  VOLODYMYR NEKRASHEVYCH]&lt;/ref&gt;. Inverse of doubling map is multivalued function.

Note that difference between these 2 preimages 

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\alpha}{2} - \frac{\alpha +1}{2} = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

is half a turn = 180 degrees = Pi radians.

On complex dynamical plane backward iteration using quadratic polynomial  &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt;
 
: &lt;math&gt;f_c(z) = z^2 + c&lt;/math&gt;

gives backward orbit = '''binary tree of preimages''' : 

&lt;math&gt;z \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; -\sqrt{z-c} ,  +\sqrt{z-c} \,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; -\sqrt{-\sqrt{z-c} -c} ,  +\sqrt{-\sqrt{z-c} -c}, -\sqrt{+\sqrt{z-c} -c}, +\sqrt{+\sqrt{z-c} -c} \,&lt;/math&gt;

One can't choose good path in such tree without extra informations.

Not that preimages show [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/Julia_set#Symmetry|rotational symmetry ( 180 degrees)]]

== Dynamic plane for &lt;math&gt;f_c&lt;/math&gt;==
===Level curves of escape time===
[[File:Preimages of curve ER.png|right|thumb|Preimages of circle under fc]]
=== Julia set by IIM/J===
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Julia_IIM_1.jpg| Preimages of repelling fixed point tend to Julia set for C = i. Image and source code
File:Miim.jpg| Julia set made with MIIM. Image and maxima source code
File:Quadratic Golden Mean Siegel Disc IIM Animated.gif| Preimages of critical orbit tend to whole Julia set in Siegel disc case
File:Iimj 5.png|distribution of points in simple IIM/J

&lt;/gallery&gt;
In escape time one computes forward iteration of point z. 

In IIM/J one computes:
* repelling  fixed point&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Periodic_points_of_complex_quadratic_mappings|wikipedia : repelling  fixed point]]&lt;/ref&gt;  of complex quadratic polynomial &lt;math&gt;Z_0=\beta_c \,&lt;/math&gt;
* preimages  of  &lt;math&gt;Z_0\,&lt;/math&gt; by '''inverse iterations'''

&lt;math&gt;Z_{n-1} = \sqrt{Z_n - C} &lt;/math&gt;



Because [[w:Square root|square root]] is  [[w:Multivalued function|multivalued function]] then each  &lt;math&gt;Z_{n}\,&lt;/math&gt; has two preimages &lt;math&gt;Z_{n-1}\,&lt;/math&gt;. Thus inverse iteration creates [[w:binary tree| binary tree]].



====Root of tree====
* repelling  fixed point&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Periodic_points_of_complex_quadratic_mappings|wikipedia : repelling  fixed point]]&lt;/ref&gt;  of complex quadratic polynomial &lt;math&gt;Z_0=\beta_c \,&lt;/math&gt;
* - beta
* other repelling periodic points ( cut points of filled Julia set ). It will be important especially in case of [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/parabolic|the parabolic Julia set]].


&quot;... preimages of the repelling fixed point beta. These form a tree like

&lt;pre&gt;                                               beta
                    beta                                            -beta
   beta                         -beta                    x                     y
&lt;/pre&gt;
So every point is computed at last twice when you start the tree with beta.
If you start with -beta, you will get the same points with half the number
of computations.

Something similar applies to the preimages of the critical orbit.  If z is
in the critical orbit, one of its two preimages will be there as well, so you
should draw -z and the tree of its preimages to avoid getting the same
points twice.&quot; ([http://www.mndynamics.com/indexp.html Wolf Jung] )

====Variants of IIM ====


*random choose one of two roots  IIM ( up to chosen level max). Random walk through the tree. Simplest to code and fast, but inefficient. Start from it.
**both roots with the same probability 
**more often one then other root
*draw all roots ( up to chosen level max)&lt;ref&gt; [http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/FRACTint/inv_julia_type.html Fractint documentation - Inverse Julias]&lt;/ref&gt;
** using recurrence

== Circuits and Trees ==

'''Circuits''' and '''Trees''' are two basic structures of planar networks. A circuit is a closed path, with no less than three links, that begins and ends at the same node. A tree is a set of connected lines that cannot form a complete circuit. &lt;ref&gt;Open source software developed by Feng Xie, Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments (MWCOG) can be used to identify tree and circuit links on planar networks.  Code can be downloaded from [http://nexus.umn.edu/Software/IdentifyingNetworkTopologies.zip]&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the individual trip level, the treeness is estimated as:

&lt;math&gt;
\phi_{tree} = \frac{l_{tb}}{l_{sb}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:

&lt;math&gt;l_{tb}&lt;/math&gt; = Length (km) of street segments belonging to a branch network within the buffer,

&lt;math&gt;l_{sb}&lt;/math&gt; = Total length (km) of the street network within the buffer.

== Wikibook on Vtk ==

I have been using vtk (and wikipedia!) for a long time; i think that the wikibook format is ideal for a compiling a introductory &amp; comprehensive guide to vtk.
vtk is an amazingly powerful system which i think is underutilized/not-well-known due to its steep learning curve; this is partly due to the fact that there are not many good introductions available (the official book is quite outdated). After banging my head about the mailing lists (and a lot of other unnecessary waste of time) i finally do know a bit about it; but i would like future readers to be able to easily learn it. Anyone willing to help? I will be able to contribute significantly only starting in June, as i am quite busy at this moment. I wanted to keep this note so that if anyone else is interested, please start it!

== Advanced Economics ==

I'm typing up my micro notes in 'Advanced Microeconomics' and adding discussion / explanation as I can.  Long term, I intend to stick to the project and add exercises, images, citations, et cetera.
I want to start 'Advanced Macroeconomics' but I dont know how. As soon as I can get going on advanced macro, I will. That said, I'm not a macro economist, nor do I want to be. I hope I can get the book off the ground, but my primary focus in the future will be micro.
The books are intended to be graduate level, and my contributions should provide a reasonable coverage of what an average first year grad student should know. 
I do not intend on creating a 'math for econ' book. Relevant mathematical references should be included in their respective chapters / books as appendix. [[User:Jcress410|Jcress410]] ([[User talk:Jcress410|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jcress410|contribs]]) 17:39, 6 April 2011 (UTC)

Also, I'm brand new to wiki books and wiki markup.  I could use help with formatting and making everything look presentable.  I'd appreciate any edits to that effect (whether you know anything about 'advanced economics' or not!)[[User:Jcress410|Jcress410]] ([[User talk:Jcress410|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jcress410|contribs]]) 00:21, 8 April 2011 (UTC)

== How To: upload arbitrary latex ==

I've created flash cards in latex using [http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/flashcards flashcards], and i think they'd be good to include in the Advanced Microeconomics text, question: do i need to compile / upload pdf or is it possible to upload the tex and allow edits? I dont mind uploading the file, but that wouldnt allow others to contribute?

== Importing books created in English Wikipedia ==

I have created two books in Wikipedia.org can I import them here?--[[User:Akkida|Akkida]] ([[User talk:Akkida|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Akkida|contribs]]) 09:23, 3 April 2011 (UTC)
:The &quot;books&quot; at Wikipedia are simply collections of articles.  If you need to import content from Wikipedia to start the writing of a book here, you can [[WB:RFI|request an import]] of the material.  But books here need to have a unified narrative and style and should not be collections of Wikipedia articles, so you'd have to know the subject material in order to develop a true textbook. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:14, 3 April 2011 (UTC)

Is it inappropriate to copy/paste sections of english Wikipedia articles in order to prevent duplication of effort? If so, how is attribution handled? [[Special:Contributions/74.142.220.58|74.142.220.58]] ([[User talk:74.142.220.58|discuss]]) 16:45, 6 April 2011 (UTC)
:Yes it is inappropriate, it is a copyright / attribution violation. You need to provide an inline reference back to the permanent URL of the source in WP. Alternatively, the WP page can be imported with its history to WB &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 17:18, 6 April 2011 (UTC)
== Importing, translating a French Wikibook into an English Wikibook ==

I am interested in writing a Wikibook (in English). A recent search has shown that such a book has already been started on the French Wikibooks site. It makes a lot of sense to import and translate this book as a basis for an English one. Can anyone advise me on how best to do this?
Many thanks, [[User:Davidc|Davidc]] ([[User talk:Davidc|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Davidc|contribs]]) 17:58, 19 April 2011 (UTC)
: Put the book's name on [[Wikibooks:Requests for import]] and the first admin to notice it will import it for you.  The admin will then advise you where you can find the imported copy.  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 00:26, 20 April 2011 (UTC)
::We can't import from any other language Wikibooks, however (without reconfiguration).  Instead, please provide a permanent link to the page at fr.wikibooks (click &quot;permanent link&quot; in the toolbox at left) in the edit summary when you create a new page.

== [[History of Hong Kong]] ==

[[History of Hong Kong]] is 25% finished so I'd like to hear opinions. I've done a lot of the Imperial Years section, and will finish it when I get to borrow the ancient history book again. I also started on the revolution chapter, which I plan to be rather long. I'd like to hear comments on the book. Also, if you're interested in repetitive work, there's some at [[Talk:History of Hong Kong]] - I need a lot of help on organising the index. Thanks [[::User:Kayau|Kayau]] {{toolbar|separator=dot

: Hi Kayau! Just from my first look at this wikibook, I would say a bit more text explaining the wikibook is needed on its front page. You need to hook potential readers and editors by getting them excited to read the content you've provided. Give them something like &quot;Welcome to the '''History of Hong Kong''' wikibook! Hong Kong has a rich history consisting of migration, revolution, war and political strife. This wikibook aims to provide information on the island nation of Hong Kong, covering everything from Prehistoric times to the Hong Kong of today. Please read on and enjoy! If you wish to edit the History of Hong Kong wikibook, please read the About section of this wikibook for style guide information.&quot;--[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thereen|contribs]]) 16:50, 21 April 2011 (UTC)
== compile local? ==

Is there a compiler for wikicode that runs without a server (like latex) so one can edit wikicode locally (in vim) and check the code without using the actual 'edit' button?  I find myself copy-pasting from vim into my browser a lot. [[User:Jcress410|Jcress410]] ([[User talk:Jcress410|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jcress410|contribs]]) 00:24, 8 April 2011 (UTC)

:I personally don't know of any, since MediaWiki's renderer operates on a server.  You could set up a local installation of [[mw:|MediaWiki]] on your local desktop computer (also installing [[w:Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] and [[w:PHP|PHP]] to preview the output of the wikicode if you so desired. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 01:38, 8 April 2011 (UTC)</text>

== Preface ==
To start writing games for Microsoft's XBox360, one usually has to read many books, web pages and tutorials.  This class project tries to introduce the major subjects, get you started and if needed point you into the right direction for finding additional material.

The idea behind this class project came from a colleague who suggested that most class projects produce really nice results, but usually disappear in some instructors' drawers.  After reading on the possibility of using Wikibooks for class projects, we just had to give it a try.  

=== Getting Started ===
If you are new to Wikibooks, you might first want to look at [[Using Wikibooks]].  Details for creating a class project can be found at [[Using_Wikibooks/Class_Project_Guidelines|Class_Project_Guidelines]].  

=== Other Wikibooks ===
There are also other wikibooks on subjects related that are quite useful:
*[[Creating a Simple 3D Game with XNA]]
*[[Video Game Design]]
*[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]]
*[[C Sharp Programming]]
*[[Introduction to Software Engineering]]
*[[Game Creation with the Unity Game Engine]]

=== Other Class Projects ===
Inspiration from successful class projects can be drawn here, which by themselves are also quite interesting and maybe helpful for this project:
*[[Basic Writing]]
*[[Geometry]]
*[[Handbook for Doctoral Students in Education]]

== Introduction ==
Game development is neither easy nor cheap, instead it is a multi-billion dollar, fast growing industry.  It is challenging in terms of hardware and software, always using cutting edge technology.  

The XBox 360 contains gaming hardware which is among the most sophisticated available.  It has a PowerPC-based CPU with 3 cores running at 3.2 GHz with 2 threads each.  For graphics it uses a custom ATI Graphics (Xenos) card running at 500 MHz with 48-way parallel floating-point shader pipelines.

Hence, in game development we have already made the paradigm shift away from the single-core single-threaded application, because in the XBox we are dealing with 6 threads running in parallel on the CPU, with 48 threads running in parallel on the GPU and with hundreds of GFLOPS computing power.  Therefore, game programming is parallel programming!

So how can we learn about game development, how can we get started?  Microsoft with the XNA Game Studio and the XNA Framework has made it pretty easy to get started.  With openly available components, even a 4th semester student can start writing a 3D race car simulation.  A very nice feature of the XNA Game Studio is the fact that you can run the programs not only on the Xbox, but also on the PC, which is very nice for development. 

Before we can get started writing code, we need to get our environment set up, install necessary software, including  Visual Studio, learn a little about C# and the basics of game programming.  Also handling of input devices is covered here.

== Introduction ==
Good sound is a crucial part in a successful game.  For this you need to learn about XACT and about ways to creation sound and audio.  Also finding free sounds is an important topic.

'''Sound''' is a wave form that travels through all types of terrestrial [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Matter matter] (solids, liquids and gases).  Humans can hear sound as a result of these waves moving the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Ear_drum ear drum], a membrane that, with the help of the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Middle_ear middle ear], translates sound in to electrical signals.  These signals are sent along nerves to the brain, where they are &quot;heard&quot;.  We most commonly hear sound waves that have traveled through the air. For example what we call thunder, is the shock wave of a lightning bolt; that is, when lightning strikes, it displaces the air around it sending sound waves in all directions.  We can also hear sound in water and through solids. Because of their higher density, sound actually travels farther in these mediums than through the air.  Sound, as we normally think of it, usually originates from some sort of movement or vibrating body.

[[File:SoundWaveDiagFreqAmp.png‎|thumb|A sound wave with frequency and amplitude labeled.]]
The '''frequency''' of a sound wave, measured in [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Hertz Hertz] (Hz), determines the '''[https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Pitch_%28music%29 pitch]''', or how high or low a sound is.  It is the distance between peaks in a sound wave.  Longer, low frequency wave forms (e.g. bass sounds) travel farther and can travel through different forms of matter more easily than high frequency sound waves.  Whales use both high frequency sound waves, including [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Ultrasound ultrasound] and low frequency sound, including [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Infrasound infrasound].  The loudest and lowest sounds they make, travel the farthest, up to hundreds of miles.

The '''amplitude''' or '''[https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Loudness loudness]''' of a sound wave, is measured in [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Decibels decibels] (dB) which is a logarithmic scale.  A jet engine is frequently said to be around 140 dB, while a [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Blue_whale blue whale] call can be up to 188 dB.  Due to the nature of the dB scale, these sounds are millions of times louder than a whisper.

Even very &quot;simple&quot; sounding tones, like that of a flute, are not perfect [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Sine_wave sine wave] forms. Hardware and software based sound generators ''are'' able to create sine waves and other wave forms such as triangle (saw) or [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Square_wave square waves].  In general each perceived, or [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Fundamental_tone fundamental tone] may have a series of [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Overtones overtones] and [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Harmonics harmonics].

== Introduction ==
Unfortunately, every good game, especially the 3D kind, needs a basic knowledge of vectors and matrices.  Also collision detection, especially when dealing with thousands of objects requires special data structures.  Ballistics and Inverse Kinematics are also topics covered here, as well as character animation.  Last but not least, a couple of physics engines are introduced.

The Kinect is a cool new device.  Unfortunately, using it as an input device is not yet supported by the XNA framework (but soon will be).  In the meantime, however, it can be used to create realisitic 3D models. http://www.heise.de/ix/artikel/2011/03/links/114.shtml

      <text xml:space="preserve">Games always provided an environment for developing artificial intelligence. So in the last decades it became one of the most important components of games. Nowadays games that have sophisticated AI are state of the art.
Some simpler and some more sophisticated algorithms you will need in many games. 
It is used in many situations, some are:
* control of NPCs
* pathfinding
* dynamic game difficulty balancing
* combats / fights

== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;History&lt;/span&gt; == 

Already in the very beginning of game development, in the 1970s, programmers and developers came face to face with the field of game artificial intelligence. But at this time AI was simple and so to say humble and that status didn’t change until few years ago.
 
:&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;&quot;AI has been quietly transformed from the redheaded stepchild of gaming to the shining star of the industry&quot;&lt;/span&gt; - ''Steve Rabin, AI Game Programming WISDOM, 2002, p. 3''

The first games featuring a single player mode and therefore AI in its very beginning like the Atari game “Qwak!” didn’t have AI like we would describe it today. Enemy movement was mostly predefined and stored as patterns.
Only with the improvement of the hardware like the incorporation of microprocessors, that allowed way more computation, further random elements could be implemented. Games resulting from that were for example Space Invaders, Galaxian, and Pac-Man. Those games presented e.g. an increasing difficulty level, complex and varied enemy movements, events depending on the players input and even different personalities for each enemy. 
Along with the loom of new game genres in the 1990s new AI tools were developed and used. Among these tools were for example finite state machines. 
In the newer games AI became the main aspect of game. 
The improvement of AI didn’t only depend on the given hardware components. Well, in fact it definitely was a very important aspect. There were some problems that couldn’t be solved without significant processor resources. But it should be added that in the beginning of game development programmers simply didn’t take AI overly serious. Mostly AI was done in the very end after completing all the high-priority tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author = Steve Rabin |title = AI Game Programming Wisdom |year = 2002 |publisher = Cengage Learning }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
:&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Today AI climbed up the games ladder to be the highest-priority task.&lt;/span&gt;

== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Difficulties&lt;/span&gt; ==
AI has to be calculated live (during the game), therefore (good) performance is very important to let the game run smoothly. To ensure that there are many simplifications, workarounds, cheats in the algorithms which approximate the ideal behaviour of the player. So they are fast and intelligent at the same time. When performance is an important issue, it is clear that stuff like bruteforcing all possible decisions is not the best way to deal with such situations in game AI.

Another essential fact is that the computer player should not play perfect even if he could. Cheating is a big word in that topic, because the computer knows all facts and has all kinds of information about the game world so it would be possible to let the AI player know things they realistically could not know. The player has to think he plays against a real enemy and not a computer, that is why firstly the AI has to be beatable (not invincible) and furthermore it has to act human-like (do mistakes, act randomly in some situations, etc.). If the AI does not behave in this way the game would be soon very boring for the player or just frustrating if he has no chance to win. Some games use approximation algorithms instead of perfect solutions and implement &quot;wrong&quot; (or worse) decisions in their algorithms.

:&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;half-dozen rules of thumb and heuristics, just enough to give a good gameplay experience&lt;/span&gt;

== Introduction ==
Many games require 3D.  This used to be very complicated, but has gotten significantly easier with the XNA framework.  Still, you need to learn about many new concepts.  We first introduce primitive objects, such as vertices and index buffers.  Essential for creating 3D models is 3D Modelling Software and also finding free models.  Importing models into XNA is also not trivial.  Related to 3D are concepts related to camera and lighting, as well as shaders and effects.  Also topics such as skybox and landscape modelling are covered here.  Lastly, we introduce some 3D engines.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi I regularly edit Wikipedia. Just found out that my account doesn't carry over to Wikibooks. I'd like to include [[Operating System Design]] on this page because I have no idea how anyone would ever navigate to it otherwise without searching. However I can't because someone made the page not editable unless you are privledged. Sorry for my griping- I would just request this restriction be removed or someone add the link themselves. --[[User:Evolutionist79|Evolutionist79]] ([[User talk:Evolutionist79|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Evolutionist79|contribs]]) 20:25, 26 April 2011 (UTC)
:All Subject pages are semi-protected as they are highly visible if vandalised. However, they do not need editing to include other books. They auto-include any books with a matching subject. So to make Operating System Design appear here, the trick is to add &lt;nowiki&gt;{{subjects|Operating systems}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the Operating System Design book, which I've now done. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:07, 26 April 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Provisions are a form of liability. An example of a provision is provision for honoring warranties on defective products sold.

They can encompass mainly liability that requires settlement within 12 months, therefore they may be regarded as current liabilities. They are not the same as normal liability because there is uncertainty about when they fall due, and the exact amount required for settlement when they fall due, and to whom it is due, but some reasonable estimates can be made from past events as to how much will be due , and that settlement will be probably required for the amount. Hence provisions meet the recognition criteria of probable and measurable for liabilities.

Future costs can not be provisioned, because a liability by definition requires an outflow of economic benefit or is a current economic burden owed to other entities, and not to the self entity. A future cost is an expense , not a liability, and is expended when it occurs, and not settled.

Contingent liabilities are like poorly known provisions, where the amount of liability may be inexact, the probability of occurrence is not highly probable, and although cannot appear in the financial statements ( e.g. as a liability in the balance sheet ) , would make the company look pretty bad if not reported in some way when they are known to have a significant possibility (5-50%) of occurring, so they must be disclosed in the notes to financial statements to discharge the duty to materiality and prudence. An example is a future possible legal settlement cost. Similar to provisions, contingent liabilities are liabilities that cannot be corrected by present decisions to rectify the future obligation, even though the obligations have not certainly occurred.

I suggest using [[:File:Ramell de molí decagonal.jpg]] instead of [[:File:Julia set 10th power.png]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Setup ==
For this book we will use Visual Studio 2008 and the XNA Framework 3.1.  Although there are newer versions available, for many reasons we will stay with this older version.

__TOC__
=== Preparation ===
You should first make sure that you have a newer version of Windows, such as XP, Vista or 7, with the appropriate service packs installed.  In general, it is a good idea to use the US version of the operating systems.  In addition, since at least DirectX 9 compatibility is needed, you may not be able to use a virtual machine (such as Parallels, VMWare or Virtual Box) for doing XNA programming.  

Make sure that no older or newer version of Visual Studio is installed on your computer.  Especially with older version there are always issues.  It is good advise not to have several versions of Visual Studio running on one computer.

=== Install Visual C# 2008 Express Edition ===
First download the [http://www.microsoft.com/express/Downloads/#2008-Visual-CS|Visual C# 2008 Express Edition] from Microsoft.  You can also use the Visual Studio Express version.  Installation is straightforward, simply follow the wizard.  After installation, make sure you run Visual Studio at least once before proceeding to the next step.



=== Install the DirectX Runtime ===
Download and install the [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=402111C4-6478-46C1-BBD9-1BF9FCCE52F4|DirectX 9.0c Redistributable for Software Developers].  This step should not be necessary on newer Windows version.  First, try to get away without it, if in a later part you get some funny error message related to DirectX, then execute this step.

=== Install XNA Game Studio 3.1 ===
After having run Visual Studio at least once, you can proceed with the installation of the XNA Game Studio.  First, download [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=80782277-d584-42d2-8024-893fcd9d3e82|Microsoft XNA Game Studio 3.1].  Execute the installer and follow the instructions.  When asked, allow communications with XBox and with network games.

[[File:XNA.PNG|XNA]]

=== Test your Installation ===
To see if our installation was successful, let's create a first project.
# start Visual C# 2008 Express Edition
# select File-&gt;New Project under 'Visual C#-&gt;XNA Game Studio 3.1' you should see a 'Platformer Starter Kit (3.1)', click OK to create the project
# to compile the code use either 'Ctrl-B', 'F6' or use 'Build Solution' from the Build menu
# to run the game use 'Ctrl-F5', enjoy
# take a look at the code, among other things, notice that a 'Solution' can have several 'Projects'

=== Next Steps (optional) ===
We will only develop games for the PC, if you want to develop games for the XBox also, you need to   become a member of XBox LIVE and purchase a subscription (in case your university has a MSDN-AA subscription, membership is included). 

=== Advice ===

You need to be attentive of which XNA version you have to install.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Visual Studio , created and providing by Microsoft, is an [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrierte_Entwicklungsumgebung IDE] for developers who want to evolve different applications based on Windows and the [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/.NET .NET] platforms.
It supports developers/programmer with a widespread accumulation of development programmes for generating different kinds of applications e.g. Windows applications, ASP.NET applications or Webservices. 
Professional programmer as well as free coder like to use Visual Studio for developing because the IDE supports many different programming languages: Visual Basic, C, C++, C++/CLI, C# und F#.

We are going to use Visual Studio, during our exercise course, to create a small 3D game. To develop those games we apply Visual Studio including the [http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/XNA_(Microsoft) XNA- framework].
An instruction on how to install Visual Studio including XNA is declared on [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Game_Creation_with_XNA/Basics/Setup WikiBook: Setup].

==Features==

Visual Studio supports the developer with helpfull features which are useful in every development step. 

===The Code Editor===

Visual Studio allocates a useful code editor which supports the user during writing the source code by highlighting the syntax and suggesting code complements.
The code editor tries to complete methods and functions. It is also usefull when the developer wants to have quick access to his defined variables e.g. by entering the first letter, the code editor proposes all variables beginning with it.

===Designers===

Visual Studio offers different visual designer which help the coder during developing their applications: 

; Web designer/development
: Visual Studio offers another editor for creating and designing web pages. The Web designer supports the user during the development of an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASP.NET ASP.NET] application.  
; Windows Forms Designer
: This designer can be used to add control devices to a form and code the specific functions behind it. 
; WPF Designer
: The WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) Designer also behaves like the Forms Designer but is used to build WPF control devices and applications.
;Class designer
:The Class designer is a tool that makes it possible to model a class diagram of the developed application. The Class Designer models the connection and structure of it. It is not only used for classes but also for structures, delegates and interfaces.
;Mapping designer
: This designer mappes the classes and the database schemas that seal the data.

===Debugging===

Visual Studio comes along with its own debbuger. The debugger supports by securing that the application operates in a logical way and as you want it to operate.
It makes it possible to stop on different code positions to check the building.

===Expandability===

The developer using Visual Studio has the chance to expand the functions of the standard Visual Studio.

===Browser and Explorer===

;Object Browser
:The Object Browser makes it possible to appraise  the available symbols for use in Visual Studio. The Browser uses three panes: the Objects pane, the Members Pane and the Description pane.
;Open Tabs Browser
:The Open Tabs Browser displays als open tabs and switches between them. 
;Properties Editor
:Used to see all available properties for all objects and other items. Furthermore it is used to edit them.
;Solution Explorer
:The Solution Explorer is used for the arrangement of item management tasks in a project/solution. It is possible to handle with items outside a project.
;Data Explorer
:The Data Explorer is used to administrate databases. The administration provides the creation and  creation and modification of database tables.
;Team Explorer
:The Team Explorer accesses the Team Foundation Server and the revision control.
;Server Explorer
:The Server Explorer establish the connection to the server. It offers the task to edit the ressources.
;Text Generation Framework
:The Text Generation Framework, also called t4, is a code generator which uses textfiles from templates.

= Story Writing and Character Development =

A good game lives and dies with it`s characters and it`s story. A good story is what catches the player, keeps him interested and makes him want to continue. The story is the frame for all the action which is taking place, wrapping everything together. But story alone will never keep the player going. There is no good story without good characters and vice versa. The characters in the story are just as important. Not only the main character, but all characters he is interacting with, all characters who motivate him or influence him to do the things he does. Therefore its most crucial, for a good story, to create the story and all characters within in a way so they form a coherent unity. Imagine a Spacetrooper crossing Frodos way in [[:w: The Lord of the Rings|The Lord of the Rings]]. That simply would`nt fit and would definitly ruin the story. But what exactly is a good story? And what exactly are good characters, fitting this very story? As always, whether or not a story and its genre are interesting, is a question of taste and lies in the eye of the beholder. Whereas whether a story is written in a good or a bad way, follows certain mechanics. Same applies for the characters in the story. Its personal taste whether you like the good guy or prefer the bad guy. But creating a character which is “self-contained” and well made, again follows certain mechanics.
However you write a story or chreate your character, is totally up to you. But looking at what other authors and game developers do, makes it easier. There are certain tools and ways how to write the story and create the character for your game. The more detail you want to put in the more research you should do. There are many books out there that might help you to dive deeper int o the matter of Story Writing and Character Development. Covering it all would simply be to much. This article will give you a basic insight into Character Development and Story Writing for Games.&lt;br /&gt;















== Character Development ==

On the following pages I will describe techniques to develop/create a character for a game or a story. Character development in terms of progress while playing, gaining expirience, increasing level, learning skills and so on,  is not part of this article, will be referred to by certain links though. Focus of this article is character creation prior to the game.&lt;br /&gt;


=== Preliminary Work ===

The probably most important thing when creating a character is to know its purpose. Are you creating the main character of the story, the villain, a sidekick, a servant, a random companion or something else? Knowing the role of the character makes it easier to define his behaviour, his actions, his way of thinking and his overall appearance. After you have choosen the scope of your character, the actual work begins. Inform yourself! Read as much about the type of the character as you can. Ask yourself questions to define the character. 

::* Do characters like this already exist in other games or stories? 
::* What has been written by other authors? 
::* Are there already stereotypes of this charakter and do they fit to your creation?
::* Is he a servant? How does it feel to serve?
::* Is he a soldier? How does it feel to be in battle? 
::* Is he a priest? How does it feel to pray to god?

Learn as much about the character as you can. Check all available resources. Talk to friends. Keep asking questions. If you dont find exactly what your looking for, stick to your own imagination and feelings. In the end it`s your creation. There are certain things to consider though. Do you create a character who is part of an already existing universe (like an orc or a dwarf or a human)? If so think about the characteristics already applied to them. Like, orcs are green, dwarfs a small and humans can’t breath underwater. Do you want to stick to these basic characteristics that are already present in the players imagination, or do you want to create something totally new? However you decide, keep in mind how the player could react on your creation.&lt;br /&gt;




=== Point of View and Background ===

In order to make your character authentic, try to look through his eyes. Try to be your character and keep your eyes open to the world and how the character perceives it. How do things look? Why do they look like this? How do things feel? Why do they feel that way? What feels good? Why does it feel good? The WHY of things sometimes is more important than the things themselves. To understand the WHY, it is necessary to understand the background of your character. 
A real person develops a certain understanding of the world and has an individual point of view on things, depending on his own expirience, on his way of growing up and on all the things that happened in his life. And probably only he can tell how he became the person he is today. Since your character is a creation of your fantasy, you are the only one that can tell how he became the character he is. The more specific you describe the characters background the easier it will be for the player to understand him and feel with him. The player must not necessarily agree with the characters attitude, but he will more likely understand it, if you provide a detailed explanation for his behaviour. 
The more you think in detail the more realistic your character will be. You are the one to decide how much detail your character needs. But in general the main characters in your game should posses more detail and depth, than any character in a supporting role.&lt;br /&gt;

=== Motivation &amp; Alignment ===

Understanding the WHY of things is a good start to understand the motivation behind decisions your character makes. Motivation is the force that drives all of your characters, may it be good or evil. What is the motivation of the plumber Mario to take all the efforts? To rescue the princess and stop Bowser. What is Bowser`s motivation? To take over the Mushroom Kingdom. Both of them are driven by their motivation.
To understand the motivation of a character, and eventually agree with it, you need to know as much about the character as possible. Giving your character an alignment will help to understand his actions and might even help to understand and clarify his motivation. 
SuperMario wants to save the princess, never does any bad things and therefore is easily classified as good. So is Bowser. He embodies everything which is considered bad, so he is the bad guy, period. 
But saying “Well, he is a bad guy, and that’s why he is doing bad things.” won’t do the trick for more detailed characters. The more detailed a character gets, the more complicated it is to classify him as good or evil. Some people do the right things for the wrong reasons and some do the wrong things for the right reasons. Who is the good and who is the bad guy?
To help you align your character to a side, you should look at his intention. When he is doing a good thing and furtermore intended to do a good thing, he is probably a good guy. But no one is entirely good or purely evil. Most characters are neutral until their actions proove them to be good or evil. Here is a  list of the three stereotypes and their attributes to help you classify your character:&lt;br /&gt;


==== Good ====
::* does the right things for the right reasons
::* loves and respects life in every form
::* tries to help others
::* puts others interests over its own
::* sticks to the law
::* is driven by the wish to do the right thing even when not knowing what the right thing is&lt;br /&gt;


Be careful when creating your Hero. There would be no fun running through the game being invincible, being too strong or beeing too clever. If things are too easy, players will loose interest very fast. To make him interesting a hero must not be perfect. He should have some weaknesses and flaws the player can identify with. Most heros don’t even know they are heros. They can be just like you and me, living their lives and doing their daily work. Suddenly something happens and they simply react. Driven by their inner perception of what is right and wrong, driven by their alignment, they react in a way which slowly transforms them into what we would call a hero. Frodo for example never chose to be a hero, he was chosen and became a hero while fullfilling the task he was given.
A hero needs to grow with his challenges. And exactly that is what makes the hero so interesting for the player. The change that happens and the fact that the player witnesses the transformation from the normal guy to the saviour of the world. While creating your character, keep in mind that every hero has skills and talents that enable him to fullfill his task. Some of them are special or even unique which make the hero appear special. But what really makes the hero interesting and appealing to the player are his flaws and merits. A knight in shiny armor, a huge sword and a big shield who slays dragons seems  impressive and adorable. But giving him flaws and merits like, beeing afraid of small spiders make him much more realistic and bring him closer to the player.&lt;br /&gt;

==== Neutral ====

::* sometimes does the right things			
::* sometimes behaves selfish and does the wrong things
::* hard to say on which side they are - sometimes they dont know themselves
::* even though they call themselves neutral their actions sometimes prove otherwise
::* good alignment for sidekicks of hero and villain - Devils advocat
::* Anti-Heros can be neutral and pushed from one side to the other&lt;br /&gt;
 

Neutral characters dont choose a side per se. They base their decisions and actions on their mood at a apecific point. Most characters are neutral until they have to decide which way to go. And after that descision they can still change their mind again. Whatever suits them best.&lt;br /&gt;


==== Evil ====
		
::* is selfish
::* greedy, insane or pure evil
::* shows no interest for others
::* puts his own goals infront of everything else
::* must have a strong motive
::* the reader must love to hate him simply cuz he embodies everything we hate or never would consider doing&lt;br /&gt;


The bad guy is motivation number one for every hero. Either he threatens peace and harmony, or he kidnappes the princess, or he wants to destroy the world or whatever. He actualy makes the hero become a hero. The villain does not always think of himself as bad person, he is convinced that what he is doing is right (in his world) and the hero, in his eyes, is the bad guy trying to ruin everything. Point of view is very important.
Sometimes the bad guy is’nt bad because he chose to be, but rather was forced to, by complicated circumstances. Whether or not you tell the player, is totally up to you. There are different ways to aproach the creation of the bad guy. Either you say he is a bad guy and does all the things bad guys do. In that case the player probably won’t build up a closer relation to the bad guy. He is just the one that needs to be whiped out in order to restore peace and harmony. Or you create your bad guy more sophisticated. Disguise him in a way so the player does not recognize him as the bad guy from the beginning. Or you give him some features that make him appear nice in a certain way. For example he loves his dog and would do everything for him. Or you create an inner conflict which throws him from side to side. Something that might let the player feel with the bad guy. Keep in mind that the bad character should also have skills, talents, flaws and merits to make him as realistic as possible.&lt;br /&gt;


For more detailed information about archetypes, their features and use in stories check [[:w:Archetype|Archetypes]].


=== Resumé Character Development===

At the end of the day it’s your character. You alone decide how he will look, how he will behave and how he will react. And because you spend many hours thinking about how your character should be like, it is important to take care about the player understanding your intention. The more detail a character gets, the more interesting he will be. The more interesting a character is, the more the player will like him. The more the player likes your character the more he will enjoy the game.It is pretty easy to overload a character with all features fitting a single alignment. Make the bad guy the most evil creature you can imagine, or make your hero the shiniest of all white knights. But the more you mix up your characters the more relistic he will be. However you decide and whatever character you create, make sure it fits your story and your purpose.


== Story Writing / Story Telling ==

Writing a story often begins with an idea. Where that idea comes from may differ though. Either you want to make a game out of a movie or a book you like, you want to create something totally new, or you want to make a sequel of an existing game. Depending on the source of your idea, different things are to be considered when writing. In general one can say, writing a story and creating a game should go hand in hand. It’s never a good idea to clamp a story to an already existing game design and vice versa. Both, Design and Story grow and therefore it’s a good idea to make them grow parallel.&lt;br /&gt;


=== Adapting a movie or a book ===

When adapting a movie or a book you necessarely need to take things from the movie. Either the story, the main characters, the setting or all of it. Otherwise it would’nt be an adaptation. If you want to adapt the whole movie you need to be clear of certain things. Yo need to stay true to the original material. When doing so you need to be aware of  that not everything that is working good in a movie works for a game. Some parts of the story are moving on without the character even being present. You have to fill in that information with cutscenes or videos which take the player out of the game. That’s no big deal in a movie because you sit and watch it anyway and don’t interact with it. It can be frustrating for a player though, to not be able to interact in a specific situation. Another point to think about is the fact that the player might know the end of the game already due to the fact he knows the movie. This could take away some thrill but on the other hand could make the player identify with the hero because he is doing all the things the hero does in the movie.&lt;br /&gt;



=== Creating a sequel ===

Main reason for creating a sequel of a game is the success the original game already had. There is an existing market with fans and maybe even working merchandise. Furthermore there already is a name, so that sequels of games mostly start with a little bonus on their side. The flip side of sequels are the expectations the fans have. The new title has to be bigger, faster, better… simply more. Often better graphics, bigger explosions, better sound and cooler style are not enough to guarantee the success of a sequel. There are certain ways to approch a sequel. First one is to simply take what was working in the last part, rehash it a bit, don’t add new features but just continue the story. That’s no guarantee for failure, but certainly leads in that direction. A better way to do it is to look for the key features of the original game, polish them up, place them in a new setting and create a game which relates to the original but can also stay on its own. The good thing is that you don’t have to start from scratch, but can use much of the work already done for the original. So you have more time to focus on the details which where neglected or not even thought of  in the original. Focus on the main character, give him more depth, add to his story. Take some of his abilities and think of new ways to use them. Improve or worsen them. A big bonus is that you already know what exactly was good about the original and what was bad. Take the good things, add more of them and whipe out the bad stuff. But just taking and polishing up what was there before will not be enough. Add more content by adding more story and detail to your characters. Add more features but don’t overload the game.&lt;br /&gt;


=== Creating a whole new story ===

When creating a whole new story you are quite free to do whatever you want. Keep in mind certain things though. If you want to create a game which shall be successful and should sell good you need to know what kind of games are played at the moment and why. You should consider how the players think and what they want. Next thing to consider is what kind of story do you want and then choose an appropriate game-style to match your story. Decide for a genre ([[:w:Game_genre Video|Game Genres]] / [[Game_Creation_with_XNA/Game_Creation/Types_of_Games|Types of Games]]). Not all genres are able to transport the story of your game. Already existing genres might have content which serve your needs and are already established. On the other hand genres do have boundaries which are not easy to cross. Whatever genre and style you choose for your game, stick to it throughout the whole game.&lt;br /&gt;


=== How to actually write a story ===

Every story needs a title, a prolog, a main part and an epilog. Furthermore a story needs characters, because no story without character and no character without story. This seems a bit flat but that’s all there is to it. Lets dive a bit deeper into the single parts.&lt;br /&gt;


==== Title ====

The title should fit your story. It should create an interest to play the game. It should partially reveal what the game is about but not say to much to keep the thrill.&lt;br /&gt;


==== Prologue ====
 

The [[:w:Prologue|prologue]] usually starts with a description of the game world as it is. The player becomes a first impression and a feeling for the setting. A good [[:w:Prologue|prologue]] rouses the players desire to explore. Actually everything is in order. Furthermore the prologue gives background details needed to understand what is going on.&lt;br /&gt;


==== Main part ====

The main part usually starts with a call to adventure or a reason to start playing. Whatever that my be in your story. Either the princess gets kidnapped, your character’s village gets destroyed by Dark Riders, or your character simply wants to break out of his world. Referring to [[:w:Joseph_Campbell|Joseph Campbell's]] [[:w:Monomyth|Monomyth]] the hero refuses this first call to adventure and needs further persuasion to finally start his journey. But as for games the player wants to play, he wants to explore and wants to take the journey. That’s why he plays the game. So the call of adventure gets our character going. On this journey the character is faced with multiple challenges he has to overcome in order to come a step closer to his final goal. (Whatever that is…). With every challenge the character passes he will grow stronger and will come closer to his goal. But every challenge which is overcome, is followed by an even greater challenge. [[:w:Lee_Sheldon_(writer)|Lee Sheldon]] writes in his book Character Development and Story Telling for Games:&lt;br /&gt;


::::''“We have our crisis then. A major change is going to occur. Only one? No. As we move through the story, crisis follows crisis, each one escalating tension and suspense.&lt;br /&gt;
::::''Every one of these crises needs an additional element a climax. Egri says, “crisis and climax follow each other, the last one always on a higher plane than the one before…&lt;br /&gt;

::::''…Resolution is simply the outcome of the climax that is a result of the crisis. The story is built from this three-step dance. Every one of these crises has reached a&lt;br /&gt;
::::''climax and has been resolved, only to have the stakes raised higher, and the next crisis always looming as even more profound.“''&lt;br /&gt;



But challenges should not always be slaying evil creatures or escape from a trap. Personal sacrifice, or the loss of a loved companion can be a challenge as well. Most of you might remember Gandalf falling to his assumed death in the Mines of Moria while fighting the Balrog. But Frodo and his fellowship decided to keep their eyes on the goal, grow with the challenge and move on. Challenges can also be to collect certain things, learn how craft or solve puzzles. And each challenge has a small reward, may it be experience, a new weapon, a new companion or just something that makes your character stronger and prepares him for his “final battle”. Small challenges or quests keep the player motivated. Furthermore the character should meet several other characters. All of them will have their own intend and influence on him. Some want to help him advance on his journey and some of them want to hinder or even destroy him.

Usually the main part ends with the final encounter and the ultimate reward. May it be the Lord Deamon you slay, the princess you rescue or the world you save. Again referring to [[:w:Joseph_Campbell|Joseph Campbell's]] [[:w:Monomyth|Monomyth]] this is attended by a personal sacrifice your character has to make. The hero is willing to give away his life to save the princess and to complete his task.&lt;br /&gt;


==== Epilogue ====

The [[:w:Epilogue|epilogue]] describes how the character receives the The ultimate Boon, his way home and how the story ends. Sometimes games leave an open end in order to be continued some day. Some games like [[:w:Mmorpg|MMORPG]] do not even have a “real” end. The story itself may end or pause until the next expansion is released, but the game continues.

== Inverse Kinematics ==
Inverse Kinematics (IK) is related to skeletal animation.  Examples are the motion of a robotic arm or the motion of animated characters.  [http://www.3dkingdoms.com/ik.htm Inverse Kinematics for Humanoid Skeletons Tutorial] and [[w:Inverse_kinematics|Inverse kinematics on Wikipedia]].

An example could be the simulation of a robotic arm with the XNA framework.  This chapter should worry more about the mathematical background, whereas the chapter Character Animation will deal more with the models coming from 3D modellers.

If you want to move an arm of robotics or animated characters to a certain direction this entity is mostly modeled as a rigid multibody system consisting of a set of rigid objects which are called links. These links are connected by joints. To control the movement of this rigid multibody and get it into the destined direction inverse kinematics is often used. 

The goal of inverse kinematics is to place each joint at its target. For that the right settings for the joint angles need to be found. The angles are represented by a vector &lt;ref name = &quot;buss&quot;&gt;Samuel R. Buss: [http://math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/ikmethods/iksurvey.pdf Introduction to Inverse Kinematics with Jacobian Transpose, Pseudoinverse and Damped Least Squares methods].&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Inverse kinematics is very challenging since there may be several possible solutions for the angle or none. In case of a solution complex and expensive computations could be required to find it &lt;ref name = &quot;rotenberg&quot;&gt; Steve Rotenberg: [http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:Z8SfEv2_cfwJ:graphics.ucsd.edu/courses/cse169_w05/CSE169_12.ppt+Inverse+Kinematics+%28part+1%29,+Computer+Animation%3B+Steve+Rotenberg&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=de&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESjRrDmfWoY4NMAJf1zHlQwQ3MX_bBLe6HVL0W2oP28JSk_CvGWzdYeGbjfX_Xmv9mcPJx9zDf91XFyJVqULYAcoBWKGBgKKcio_Vw6sTYAU30GLOdIJ7fJZDFJq5_QGQ-1JED0I&amp;sig=AHIEtbSbDyX18f6Dn8W0vPDDMldzcYzIBg Inverse kinematics (part 1)]&lt;/ref&gt;.  
Many different approaches for solving that problem exist:

* Jacobian transpose method
* Pseudoinverse method
* Damped Least Squares (DLS)
* Selectively Damped Least Square (SDLS)
* Cyclic Coordinate Descent 


It is a big effort to implement the Jacobian based methods because they require enormous mathematical knowledge and many prerequisites like classes for matrices with m columns and n rows or singular value decomposition. An Example for implementation can be found [http://www.math.ucsd.edu/~sbuss/ResearchWeb/ikmethods/ here].
It was created by  Samuel R. Buss and Jin-Su Kim.

All methods mentioned above except the Cyclic Coordinate Descent are based upon the Jacobian matrix which is a function of the joint angle values and used to determine the end position. They discuss the question of how to choose the angle. The values of the angles need to be altered until a value approximately equal to the target value is reached. 

Updating the values of the joint angles can be used in two ways:


1)	Each step perform a single update of the angle values (using equation) so that joint follows the target position. &lt;br /&gt;
2)	The angles are updated iteratively until it is close to a solution &lt;ref name=&quot;buss&quot;/&gt; &lt;br /&gt;


The Jacobian can only be used as an approximation near a position. The process of calculating the Jacobian must therefore be repeated in small steps until the desired end position is reached.  


Pseudo Code:


&lt;code&gt;while (e is too far from g) {

		Compute J(e,Φ) for the current pose Φ 

		Compute J-1	                        // invert the Jacobian matrix

		Δe = β(g - e)		// pick approximate step to take

		ΔΦ = J-1 • Δe	// compute change in joint DOFs

		Φ = Φ + ΔΦ	// apply change to DOFs

		Compute new e vector	// apply forward kinematics to see where we ended up

}&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rotenberg&quot;/&gt; 


The following methods deal with the issue of choosing the appropriate angle value.

=== Jacobian transpose method ===
The idea of the Jacobian transpose method is to update the angles by equation using the transpose instead of the inverse or pseudoinverse (since an inversion is not always possible)&lt;ref name=&quot;buss&quot;/&gt; .  
With this method the change to an angle can be computed directly by looping through it.
It avoids expensive inversion and singularity problems but converges towards a solution very slowly. The motion of this method closely matches the physics unlike other inverse kinematics solutions which can result in an unnatural motion &lt;ref name = &quot;taba&quot;&gt;Mike Tabaczynski: [http://www.mendeley.com/research/jacobian-solutions-inverse-kinematics-problem/#page-1 Jacobian Solutions to the Inverse Kinematics Problem]&lt;/ref&gt;.  

=== Pseudoinverse method ===
This method sets the angle values to the pseudoinverse of the Jacobian. 
It tries to find a matrix which effectively inverts a non-square matrix. It has singularity issues which tend to the fact that certain directions are not reachable.
The problem is that the method first loops through all angles and then needs to compute and store the Jacobian, pseudoinvert it, calculate the changes in the angle and last apply the changes &lt;ref name = &quot;rotenberg2&quot;&gt; Jeff Rotenberg: [http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:uOW6YBBG4AMJ:graphics.ucsd.edu/courses/cse169_w05/CSE169_13.ppt+Inverse+Kinematics+%28part+2%29,+Computer+Animation%3B+Steve+Rotenberg&amp;hl=de&amp;gl=de&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEEShQWg4xidDYD8KtL_KONJFwJSwQPS2sxXqvOZ_MFFDvxLLtsaZ83kjotirCShr0-Gi5v7sKAzKsoxmIQ74r29UXXY8VzY9Zgly1KtLy5yekRhM4SJaf_-AI3gjZbLVlauwJ69xk&amp;sig=AHIEtbTpkE9y-5qU9rIZiYHfXlRoL-IBFg Inverse kinematics (part 2)]&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== Damped Least Squares (DLS) ===
This method avoids certain problems of the pseudoinverse method. It finds the value of the angle that minimizes the quantity rather than just the one finding the minimum vector. The damping constant must be chosen carefully to make the equation stable &lt;ref name=&quot;buss&quot;/&gt;.  

=== Selectively Damped Least Square (SDLS) ===
This method is a refinement of the DLS method and needs fewer iterations. 

=== Cyclic Coordinate Descent ===
The algorithms based on the inverse Jacobian Matrix are sometimes unstable and fail to converge. Therefore another method exists. The Cyclic Coordinate Descent adjusts one joint angle at a time. It starts at the last link in the chain and works backwards iteratively through all of the adjustable angles until the desired position is reached or the loop has repeated a set number of times. The algorithm uses two vectors to determine the angle in order to rotate the model to the desired spot. This is solved by the inverse cosine of the dot product. Additionally, to define the rotation direction the cross product is used &lt;ref name = &quot;lander&quot;&gt;Jeff Lander: [http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/nsp/course/15-464/Spring07/assignments/jlander_gamedev_nov98.pdf Making Kine More Flexible]&lt;/ref&gt;.  A concept demonstration of the method can be watched [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvuO9ZHGr6k here]

Here is a sample implementation:


First we need an object that represents a joint.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;

    {

        private Cuboid cuboid;

        /// &lt;summary&gt;

        /// this will be used instead
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        public float lastAngle = 0;

        private Vector3 worldCoordinate, destination;
        
        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// where the bone does point at
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        public Vector3 Destination
        {
            get { return destination; }
            set { destination = value; }
        }

        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// the bone's source position
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        public Vector3 WorldCoordinate
        {
            get { return worldCoordinate; }
            set { worldCoordinate = value; }
        }

        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// Generates a bone by another bone's end
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        /// &lt;param name=&quot;lastBone&quot;&gt;the bone's end for this bone's source&lt;/param&gt;
        /// &lt;param name=&quot;destination&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
        public Bone(Bone lastBone, Vector3 destination) : this(lastBone.Effector, destination)
        {
        }

        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// Generates a bone at a coordinate in 
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        /// &lt;param name=&quot;worldCoordinate&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
        /// &lt;param name=&quot;destination&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
        public Bone(Vector3 worldCoordinate, Vector3 destination)
        {
            cuboid = new Cuboid();
            this.worldCoordinate = worldCoordinate;
            this.destination = destination;
        }
&lt;/source&gt;

These are the fields and constructors which we need for our bone class. The field cuboid is the 3D model which represents our bone. The destination and worldCoordinate describe the joints. The worldCoordinate shows the position of the bone. The destination is the targeted position. The first constructor contains the settings for both vectors. The second constructor takes the world position and the target position (also called end effector) and generates a new world position for the new bone from them.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// calculate's the bone's appearance appropiate to its world position
        /// and its destination
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        public void Update()
        {

            Vector3 direction = new Vector3(destination.Length() / 2, 0, 0);
            
            cuboid.Scale(new Vector3(destination.Length() / 2, 5f, 5f));
            cuboid.Translate(direction);

            cuboid.Rotate(SphereCoordinateOrientation(destination));
            cuboid.Translate(worldCoordinate);

            cuboid.Update();
        }
 &lt;/source&gt;

The update method scales the cuboid with the length of the destination vector with the width of 5 and depth of 5. It translates the cuboid by its half length to get the rotation pivot and rotates it by the sphere coordinate angles of the destination vector and translates it to its world coordinate.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// Draws the bone's appearance
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;

        public void Draw(GraphicsDevice device)
        {
            cuboid.Draw(device);
        }
 &lt;/source&gt;

The draw method draws the updated vector.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// generates the bone's rotation by unsing sphere coordinates
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        /// &lt;param name=&quot;position&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;
        /// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
        private Vector3 SphereCoordinateOrientation(Vector3 position)
        {
            float alpha = 0;
            float beta = 0;
            if (position.Z != 0.0 || position.X != 0.0)
                alpha = (float)Math.Atan2(position.Z, position.X);

            if (position.Y != 0.0)
                beta = (float)Math.Atan2(position.Y, Math.Sqrt(position.X * position.X + position.Z * position.Z));

            return new Vector3(0, -alpha, beta);
        }

&lt;/source&gt;


[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system Spherical coordinate system]

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// the bone's destination is local and points to the world's destination
        /// so this function just subtract's the bone's world coordinate from the world's destination

        public void SetLocalDestinationbyAWorldDestination(Vector3 destination)
        {
            this.destination = destination - worldCoordinate;
        }

        /// &lt;summary&gt;
        /// the bone's source plus the bone's destination vector
        /// &lt;/summary&gt;
        /// &lt;returns&gt;&lt;/returns&gt;
        public Vector3 Effector
        {
            get 
            {
                return worldCoordinate + destination;
            }
        }
    }
}

&lt;/source&gt;
The rest of the bone class is getters and setters.

The BoneChain class repressents a list of bones which are always connected once. On the one hand you can add new bones and every bone's source is the last bone's destination on the other hand you can use the cyclic coordinate descent to change the bones' positions. The class works with a list which contains the bones their coordinates. The class has two modes. The first is the creation mode where one bone is created after another and they keep connected. The other mode is the CCD (described further below).

                //if it is the first bone it will create the bone's source at the destination point
                //so it need not to start at the coordinates(0/0/0)
                if (bones.Count == 0)
                {
                    lastBone = new Bone(v, Vector3.Zero);
                    bones.Add(lastBone);
                }
                else
                {
                    Bone temp = new Bone(lastBone, v);
                    bones.Add(temp);
                    lastBone = temp;
                }
            }

= Introduction =

After finishing to develop your Xbox game, your aim will be to make as many people as possible to buy and enjoy your game to get at least the money back which you have invested into the game and at best some reward.
Microsoft itself offers a platform for downloading games which can be used to distribute games - it contains two sections, where independent developers can submit their creations.
This Book gives information about the whole platform, the special independent developers sections, describe the ways how to publish a game successfully and provides some informations how Microsoft generally promotes the Xbox to attract more users.



= Xbox Games + Marketplace =

== General ==

The Xbox Marketplace is a platform, where users can purchase games, download videos, game demos, Indie Games (will be treated in a separate chapter) and some additional content like mappacks or themes for the XBox 360 [[Wikipedia:Xbox_360#Dashboard | Dashboard]]. It was launched in November 2005 for Xbox and 3 years later, in November 2008, for Windows OS. Since 11th August 2009 it's possible to download Xbox 360 Games. The content will be saved on the Xbox 360's hard drive or an additional memory unit.


== Payment ==

The Xbox Marketplace has it's own currency: &quot;Microsoft Points&quot;. So users can purchase content without a credit card and credit card transaction fees can be avoided for Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.1up.com/news/xbl-wtf-pay-exact-change&lt;/ref&gt;
Microsoft Points are offered in packages of different quantities, from 100 up to 5000 while 80 points are worth US$1 &lt;ref&gt;http://thewrongadvices.com/2007/03/05/xbox-live-points-converter/&lt;/ref&gt; and can be purchased with credit card or Microsoft Point Cards in retail locations and since May 2011 by PayPal in supported regions.
Some points of criticism are that users have to buy usually more points then they actually need and that they obscure the true costs of the content:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''&quot;To buy even a single 99-cent song from the Zune store, you have to purchase blocks of “points” from Microsoft, in increments of at least $5. You can’t just click and have the 99 cents deducted from a credit card, as you can with iTunes. [..] So, even if you are buying only one song, you have to allow Microsoft, one of the world’s richest companies, to hold on to at least $4.01 of your money until you buy another.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://ptech.allthingsd.com/20061109/zune-challenges-ipod/&lt;/ref&gt;''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''&quot;Microsoft is obscuring the true cost of this content. A song on Zune typically costs 79 Microsoft Points, which, yes, is about 99 cents. But it seems to be less because it's just 79 Points.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/zune.asp&lt;/ref&gt;''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These statements are from [[Wikipedia:Zune | Zune]] reviews, a platform to stream and download music and movies, also with Xbox 360, similar to [[Wikipedia:iTunes | iTunes]]. Microsoft Points are the currency of Zune, too and the points can be transfered between Xbox Live Marketplace and Zune accounts.


== Xbox Live Arcade ==

=== General ===

Xbox Live Arcade was launched on 3rd November 2004 for the original Xbox. It's a section of the Xbox Marketplace which accepts games from a wide variety of sources, including indie developers, medium-sized companies and large established publishers who develop simple pick-up-and-play games for casual gamers, for example &quot;Solitaire&quot; or &quot;Bejeweled&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;http://money.cnn.com/2004/10/13/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It starts with 27 arcade games on the beginning, now there are about 400 games available.
In November 2005, Xbox Live Arcade was relaunched on the Xbox 360. It now has an fully integrated [[Wikipedia:Xbox_360#Dashboard | Dashboard]], every arcade title has a leaderboard and 200 [[Wikipedia:Xbox_Live#Gamerscore | Achievement]] points.


=== Publishing an Arcade Game ===

Publishing an Arcade Game can cost a few hundreds of dollars and takes about 4-6 month of time to develop an test for a small team. They have to work closely with the Xbox Live Arcade team on everything from game design and testing to ratings, localization and certification. If everything is finished, the Xbox Live Arcade team puts the game onto Xbox Live. The whole process can be broken down in some steps: &lt;ref&gt;http://xboxlive.ign.com/articles/721/721843p2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Contact''' - Write an email to the Arcade team with the concept, if they are interested they will send some forms to fill in.
* '''Submission''' - Submit the game concept formally with as much information as possible about design, documents, screenshots and prototypes to be discussed in the Arcade portfolio review.
* '''Create''' - After a positive review the developing can start. Tools especially for Arcade game developing are available (for e.g. Achievements and Leaderboards). An Arcade team producer get assigned to work with the developer for working on design, Gamescore and Achievments and a schedule with milestones for showing process to the Arcade team.
* '''Full test''' - Final test with debugging and verification, then the regular Xbox 360 certification to be signed.
* '''Publishing''' - The game is available at the Arcade Game Marketplace now.


== Xbox Live Indie Games ==

=== General ===

Xbox Live Indie Games is a category in the Xbox Marketplace for games from independent developers with [[Wikipedia:Microsoft_XNA | Microsoft XNA]]. The difference to the Xbox Live Arcade Games is, that Indie Games are just tested by the community, has much lower costs of production and they are often very cheap. Currently there are were submitted about 1900 Indie Games since the release at 19th November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://marketplace.xbox.com/en-US/Games/XboxIndieGames&lt;/ref&gt;


=== Publish an Indie Game ===

Before starting to develop an Indie Game, some restrictions should be noted:&lt;ref&gt;http://create.msdn.com/en-US/home/faq&lt;/ref&gt;

* The binary distribution package must be no larger than 150 MB and should be compiled as single binary package.
* The games are priced at 200, 400 and 800 Microsoft Points, games that are larger then 50 MB must be priced at least 400 Microsoft Points.
* Each game needs an eight minute trial period to offer a testing time for users. After the trial time they can decide whether they want to buy this game or not.
* Xbox Live Indie Games have not the same features as the Xbox Live Arcade Games. There are no Achievements or leaderboards available, but they include multiplayer support, game invitation, game informations, Xbox Live Avatars and Party Chat.
* AppHub membership is required


The publishing itself is also a process, but much less complex then for Xbox Live Arcade Games:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3545/sponsored_feature_democratizing_.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3840/sponsored_feature_xbox_live_.php&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Create''' - Develop the game in [[Wikipedia:C_Sharp_(programming_language)|C#]] using the [[Wikipedia:Microsoft_XNA|XNA Game Studio]] framework, to allow the developers to debug and test their game internally before release.
*'''Submission''' - Uploading the package at the App Hub website, add some metadata, specify costs and design the Marketplace offer.
*'''Playtest''' - Other developers of the App Hub community can test the game for one week to give some feedback.
*'''Peer Review''' - Developers check the game for unacceptable content, instability or other things which could block the publishing. Multile reviews are needed to pass the peer review successfully. If a game was declined, it can be resubmitted if the feedback has been used.
*'''Release''' - If the peer review was successful, the game is available in the Marketplace Indie games section. The developer now gets 70% of the profit, Mircosoft 30% (in US$!).


= AppHub =

AppHub is a specific website and community for Xbox Live Indie Games (and Windows Phone) developers. AppHub offers free tools like XNA Game Studio and DirectX Software Development Kit, provides community forums where users can ask questions, give advice, or just discuss the finer points of programming. Code samples provides developers with a jump-start to implementing new features, and the Education Catalog is packed with articles, tutorials, and utilities to help beginners and experts alike.
An App Hub annual subscription for $99 USD provides you with access to the Xbox LIVE Marketplace, where you can sell or give away your creation to a global audience. For students the membership is free if you register at MSDNAA. They also provide a developer dashboard so developers can manage all aspects of how the game appears in marketplace, monitor downloads, and track how much money they've earned.
So the AppHub membership is required to publish an Indie Game. Per year, members can submit up to 10 Indie Games, peer review new Indie Games before they get released and get offered premium deal from partners.



= Xbox Marketing Strategies =

53 million Xbox Consoles have been sold world wide, the Xbox Live community has more than 30 million members and it's getting harder for Microsoft to attract new customer. So they try to gain user from a new target audience and develop some new strategies to get the Xbox into as many homes as possible. Microsoft uses a lot of viral marketing and tries to let users to interact as much as possible in their own Xbox Live community.


== Xbox Party ==

The usual Xbox gamer is male, so there are a lot of women who can be won as new customers. Inspired by &quot;Tupperware Parties&quot;, Microsoft offers the possibility to get an Xbox pack to throw a home party to present the Xbox. Hosts got an Xbox party pack of freebies that included microwaveable popcorn, Xbox trivia game &quot;Scene It? Box Office Smash,&quot; an Xbox universal media remote control, a three-month subscription to Xbox Live, and 1600 Microsoft Points.
The aim is to spread the Xbox and get into a new target audience, everyone wants to have the console all friends are on.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessinsider.com/2009/2/microsoft-throwing-xbox-360-tupperware-parties-to-hook-women-brilliant-msft&lt;/ref&gt;


== Special offers ==

Another strategy is to reach even the last ones of the main target audience who haven't an Xbox yet. A main reason are the costs of an Xbox, a special offer for college students now offers an Xbox 360 to all U.S. college students who buy a Windows 7 PC. By targeting college kids, Microsoft is going after the sexiest demographic. College students ages 18 to 24 spend more than 200 billion dollars a year on consumables. The average student has about $600 a month in disposable income from part-time work, work-study or scholarships. They also typically don’t have mortgages or car payment. Because of this, they are able to spend their money less conservatively than an adult who has those expenses on top of paying back college loans and possibly providing for their families. &lt;ref&gt;http://smallbusiness.uprinting.com/product-marketing-strategy-microsoft-offering-students-free-xbox-360/&lt;/ref&gt;

To promote the marketplace and connect the users of Windows Phones and Xbox closer to each other, Microsoft offers a free Xbox 360 game to developers of Windows Phone Apps, the best App also wins a Windows 7 Phone. It's just available for the first 100 Apps and calles Yalla App-a-thron comeptition.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.yallaapps.com/2011/05/18/yalla-app-a-thon-%E2%80%93-publish-an-app-and-get-an-xbox-360%C2%AE-game/&lt;/ref&gt;


== Promote Indie Game ==

Indie Games are developed usually by independent developers with low costs. The best strategy to advertise for an Indie Game is spreading it as much as possible. Users can rate games in the Marketplace, games with a good rating get downloaded more often. If someone plays an Indie Game, friend in the Xbox Live are able to see that and maybe the game gets spread more and more into the community. Websites like [http://www.indiegames.com IndieGames.com] constantly present popular Indie Games, the aim of every developer should be to get as much attention as possible and to trust into viral marketing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Collision Detection =
'''Collision detection''' is one of the basic components in a 3D game. It is important for a realistic appearance of the game, which needs fast and rugged collision detection algorithms.
If you do not use some sort of collision detection in your game you are not able to check if there is a wall in front of your player or if your player is going to walk into another object.

== Bounding Spheres ==

First we need to answer the question '''&quot;What is a bounding sphere?&quot;'''
The bounding sphere means a ball which has nearly the same center point as the object which is enclosed by the ball. 
A bounding sphere is defined by its center point and its radius. 

In collision detection the bounding spheres are often used for ball-shaped objects like cliffs, asteroids or space ships.

[[Image:Radius.png|thumb|Two spheres are touching]]

Let's take a look at what happens when two spheres are touching. 
The image shows , the radius of each sphere now also defines the distance its center to the opposite sphere's skin.  
The interspace between the centers would be equal to radius1 + radius2.  If the distance would be greater, the two spheres would not touch but  if it would be less, the spheres would intersect.

A feasible way to determine if a collision has occurred between two objects with bounding spheres you can simply find the distance between their centres and see if this is less than the sum of their bounding sphere radius.

Another way to use bounding spheres is to use the balance point of the object as the center point of the bounding sphere. 
Thereby you use the midpoint of all vertices as the centre of the bounding sphere. This algorithm gives you a more exact midpoint than the first way.  

=== XNA Bounding Spheres ===

Microsofts XNA offers a model for you to use by developing your own game called '''&quot;BoundingSphere&quot;'''.
XNA provides this for you so that there is no need to calculate it. Models in XNA are made up of 1 or more meshes. 
When doing collisions you will want to have one sphere that borders the whole model. That means at model load time you will want to loop through all the meshes in your model and expand a main model sphere.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
foreach (ModelMesh mesh in m_model.Meshes)
{
    m_boundingSphere=BoundingSphere.CreateMerged(base.m_boundingSphere, mesh.BoundingSphere);
    ...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

To see if two spheres have collided Xna provides us to use:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
bool hasCollided=sphere.Intersects(otherSphere);
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;


== Bounding Rectangles or Bounding Box ==

[[Image:Bounding box.png|thumb|Bounding box]]
In collision detection handling with rectangles you want to see whether two rectangular areas are in any way touching or overlapping each other. Therefor we need to use the bounding box.
A bounding box is simply a box that encloses all the geometry of a 3D object. We can easily calculate one from a set of vertex by simply looping through all the vertices finding the smallest and biggest x, y and z values. 

To create a bounding box around our model in model space you need to calculate the midpoint an the four corner point of the rectangle we want to enclose. 
Then you need to build a matrix and rotate the four point about the midpoint with the given rotation value. 
After that we need to go through all the vertices in the model keeping a track of the minimum and maximum x, y and z positions. This gives us two corners of the box from which all the other corners can be calculated.  

===XNA Bounding Box ===

Because each model is made from a number of mesh we need to calculate minimum and maximum values from the vertex positions for each mesh. The&quot;ModelMesh&quot; object in XNA is split into parts which provides access to the buffer which is keeping the data of the vertex ('''VertexBuffer''') from which we can get a copy of the vertices using the '''GetData''' call.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public BoundingBox CalculateBoundingBox()
{

// Create variables to keep min and max xyz values for the model
Vector3 modelMax = new Vector3(float.MinValue, float.MinValue, float.MinValue);
Vector3 modelMin = new Vector3(float.MaxValue, float.MaxValue, float.MaxValue);

foreach (ModelMesh mesh in m_model.Meshes)
{
  //Create variables to hold min and max xyz values for the mesh
   Vector3 meshMax = new Vector3(float.MinValue, float.MinValue, float.MinValue);
   Vector3 meshMin = new Vector3(float.MaxValue, float.MaxValue, float.MaxValue);

  // There may be multiple parts in a mesh (different materials etc.) so loop through each
  foreach (ModelMeshPart part in mesh.MeshParts)
   {
     // The stride is how big, in bytes, one vertex is in the vertex buffer
     int stride = part.VertexBuffer.VertexDeclaration.VertexStride;

     byte[] vertexData = new byte[stride * part.NumVertices]; 
     part.VertexBuffer.GetData(part.VertexOffset * stride, vertexData, 0, part.NumVertices, 1); // fixed 13/4/11

     // Find minimum and maximum xyz values for this mesh part
     // We know the position will always be the first 3 float values of the vertex data
     Vector3 vertPosition=new Vector3();
     for (int ndx = 0; ndx &lt; vertexData.Length; ndx += stride)
      { 
         vertPosition.X= BitConverter.ToSingle(vertexData, ndx);
         vertPosition.Y = BitConverter.ToSingle(vertexData, ndx + sizeof(float));
         vertPosition.Z= BitConverter.ToSingle(vertexData, ndx + sizeof(float)*2);

         // update our running values from this vertex
         meshMin = Vector3.Min(meshMin, vertPosition);
         meshMax = Vector3.Max(meshMax, vertPosition);
     }
   }

   // transform by mesh bone transforms
   meshMin = Vector3.Transform(meshMin, m_transforms[mesh.ParentBone.Index]);
   meshMax = Vector3.Transform(meshMax, m_transforms[mesh.ParentBone.Index]);

   // Expand model extents by the ones from this mesh
   modelMin = Vector3.Min(modelMin, meshMin);
   modelMax = Vector3.Max(modelMax, meshMax);
}

// Create and return the model bounding box
return new BoundingBox(modelMin, modelMax);
}

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;



== Terrain Collision ==
[[File:Terrain.png|thumb|Un-even terrain]]
Collision detection with a terrain and an object is different than the collision between objects.

First of all you have to detect the coordinates of your current player (object).
The height map of your terrain gives you a &quot;gap value&quot; which identifies the distance between two sequenced vertices. When dividing your coordinate position through those &quot;gap values&quot; you can detect the vertices at your position. You can get from your heightmapbuffer the 4 vertices squares where you are. Using these datas and your position in this square, you can calculate the best interspace to the terrain so that there is no collision with it.

== Collision Performance ==

Sometimes collision detection slows down a game. It is the most time-consuming component in an application.
Therefor there are data structures as quadtree and octtree.

===Quadtree (2D) ===
A quadtree is a tree structure using a principle called ‘spatial locality’ to speed up the process of finding all possible collisions. 
Objects can only hit things close to them. To advance the performance you should avoid the testing again objects which are far away.
[[File:Octtree.png|thumb|Octtree]]
The easiest way to check for collision is to divide the area which is going to be checked into a consistent grid and declare each object with all intersecting grid cells. 
The quadtree tries to overcome this weakness by recursively splitting the collision space into smaller subregions. Every region is divided exactly into 4 smaller regions of the same size, so you end up having multiple grids with different resolutions, where the number of cells in a region goes go up by a power of two every time the resolution is increased.
So every object resides in the cell (called quad node or quadrant) with the highest possible resolution. A search is made by starting at the object’s node and climb up to the root node.

===Octtree (3D)===

Octtrees work the same way as quadtree. It is used for collision detection in 3D areas.

== 3D Modelling Software ==
There are many different 3D modelling programs.  Some cost money, like Cinema4D or Maya, others are free (Sketchup) or even open source such as Blender.  In this chapter we show how to exports static and dynamic models (animation) from these programs into XNA, what to worry about (such as scaling, maximum number of keyframes and/or bones, etc.), and what else can be done with those tools.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Importing Models ==
''In the previous chapter we learned how and where to find 3D models.  The real problem comes about when you actually want to use them in your game.  There are many issues to worry about.  So here we show you how to import models generated with
* Cinema4D
* Maya
* Blender
* Sketchup
* Others
into your XNA game.''

== Introduction ==

The topic of this short intro is, how to import models in XNA. Why we put this import stuff in the introduction has a simple reason... it is everytime the same with the .x files or with the .fbx files.

====Now, how do we Import the model into the XNA framework?====
First of all, the bones and polygons of your model are limited in XNA:
#Bones: max. 59 up to 79 in 4.0
#Polygons: depends on the hardware

I will show you how to import the model by using the simple code from the msdn.com site. This demo shows the most important methods which we need.
Demo:&lt;br/&gt;
http://create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/skinned_model&lt;br/&gt;

First we need a model:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt; Model currentModel;&lt;/source&gt;

next we take a look at the LoadContent() method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt; protected override void LoadContent()
        {
            // Load the model.
            currentModel = Content.Load&lt;Model&gt;(&quot;ModelName&quot;);

            // Look up our custom skinning information.
            SkinningData skinningData = currentModel.Tag as SkinningData;

            if (skinningData == null)
                throw new InvalidOperationException
                    (&quot;This model does not contain a SkinningData tag.&quot;);

        }&lt;/source&gt;

The LoadContent() method is the only way to import your models. We do not take a look on the animation so far, but this is either the topic.

== Cinema4D ==

Cinema 4D is a 3D modelling tool from Maxon and is comparable with Autodesk Maya. C4D is able to export .fbx files which then can be imported to XNA. There's no possibility to export directely to .x files like in Google's SketchUp.

In the link below you can find helpful links concerning Cinema 4D:
 http://www.der-webdesigner.net/forum/cinema-4d-f3/linksammlung-cinema-4d-t5919.html

=== Exporting in adequate formats ===

==== Simple .fbx file export ====

When you are using the normal .fbx export, sometimes the textures aren't exported as well. It's a bug caused by Maxon's C4D - maybe it works, maybe not.

*File
**Export
***Expot as .fbx

 Settings for the normal import:
 http://iclone-freebies.wikispaces.com/file/view/fbxexport.png/176558803/fbxexport.png

==== Exporting a .fbx file with a plug-in ====

 In the link below you can find an exporting/importing plug-in for C4D:
 http://forums.creativecow.net/readpost/19/873735

 YouTube Turtorial:
 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nX2k81T1eaQ

 Download:
 http://www.cactus3d.com/Plugins.html

Now you can import the .fbx file into your XNA program. It may be more reliable than the export into a .x file.

=== Importing in XNA ===

Actually for XNA it is insignificant whether the file is a .fbx or a .x file. It is only important for the modeler concerning the software he is using.

== Maya ==
[[File:Autodesk logo.svg|thumb]]
Maya is a commercial 3D computer graphics software from Autodesk. It runs an many different operatings systems like Linux, Mac OSX or Windows. Its used for all 3D aplications like video games, animations, films or visual effects. Maya and 3Ds MAX are both from Autodesk, these are consimilar whith each other.

====Is it possible to export .x files from Maya?====
The main ''problem'' in Maya and XNA is that both are written in different languages. Maya is written in OpenGL and XNA is basend on DirectX. According to this ''problem'' it is tricky to import .x files from OpenGL to DirectX but there are tools to manage this, like the cvXporter.

===Exporting in adequate formats===
=====How to Export (.x)?=====
If you use the cvXporter, here are a few steps to use this tool.
&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;Click&lt;/span&gt; http://www.chadvernon.com/blog/resources/cvxporter/ &lt;br/&gt;

Here is an example how to manage the problem if your plug-in doesnt work!
&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;Click&lt;/span&gt; http://www.gamedev.net/topic/383794-exporting-x-files-from-maya-70/ &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;color:red;&quot;&gt;Please do only these steps if the fbx and .x importer doesnt work. I will talk more about the ''fbx importer'' later.&lt;/span&gt;

=====How to Export (.fbx)?=====
The fbx format is the simplest way to export a file which can be used in XNA. Maya doesnt support the fbx file format so we have to use a plug-in.
http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/item?id=10775855&amp;siteID=123112&lt;br/&gt;
This plug-in allows us to export fbx files in Maya.

What an amazing coincidence... Autodesk knows a lot of problems and wrote a whole e-book for fbx files in Maya. So if you have some problems with the fbx exporter, please use this quite useful link.&lt;br/&gt;

== 3ds Max ==
[[File:3ds Max logo.jpg|thumb|]]
3D Studio MAX called 3ds MAX is a commercial 3D modeling tool from Autodeks.In the use and logic between Maya and 3ds Maya are not so many differences. The one and only diffence is 3ds MAX runs only on Windows systems.

==== Is it possible to export .x files from 3ds Max? ====
First of all there is no possibility to export a ''.x file'' from 3ds Max, but there are a lot of quite useful plug-ins for 3ds Max. One of those is KWXPorts.

http://www.kwxport.org/

This tool allows you to ''put the x into 3ds Max''.
XNA support also the FBX Format as well. But there could be some problems wiht the animations and textures of your model.

===Exporting in adequate formats===
===== How to export? =====
*First download the plug-in from the web-source above and install the tool.
''...a few minutes later...''
*In 3ds Max
**File--&gt;
***Export--&gt;
****KWXPort(format)--&gt;
***** The KWXPort Export Options
#Geometry
##Import the Normalt(lightning)
##Make Y up (for the right alignment)
##Export flight-handed Mesh (the mesh from the model)
#Materials
##Export Materials
##Export Textures
#Animations
##Export Animation: There is a list of all your animations, if you setup some of them in 3ds Max.Your have the option to give names to the different animations and put these animations in the correct frames from your hole animation.
#Finaly
##Export as Binary(gives us the ''best'' format)

The result is a combination of three files.
#The Texture: ''nameofthemodel.png'' 
#The DirectX File: ''nameofthemodel.x''
#The .X Log-file: ''nameofthemodel.log''
In the log file are quite useful information for us. The number of ''verteces''......and the whole ''bone-structure'' of the model whith the complete hierarchy of these.
The DirectX SDK Viewer is a nice tool to check your .x file. There you have the possibility to see the normals, the textures... on your model from the .x file.

== Blender ==

Blender is the Linux under the 3D modeling software, it is a completely open source program and it runs on all known operating systems.&lt;br/&gt;
You can do anything with blender like in the other commercial tools like Maya and so on.... UV Mapping, rigging, skinning....
and also for animations in games and film.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Here is a list of nice tutorials for Blender in combination with XNA.

====Is it possible to export .x files from Blender?====
Yes Blender is one of the tools whitch support the .x file as a simple option. But not the fbx format whitout a plug-in.

===Exporting in adequate formats===

===== How to export(.x)? =====
#File--&gt;
#Export--&gt;
#DirectX(.x)
The result is a nice .x file from your model.


===== How to export(.fbx)? =====
Here we are, again the only solution is a plugin. What else? Blender supports the script language Python, here is a nice script for the export to xna.&lt;br/&gt;

== Sketchup ==

Sketchup is an opensource software from Google for developing 3D models. There are two different versions available - the &quot;normal&quot; and the Pro Sketchup. In the normal version 3D exporting is restricted supported. You can only export your models into 2D image formats like .jpg, .png, .tif and .bmp or the one and only 3D format COLLADA (.dae). The Pro version allows exports into additional 2D formats (.pdf, .eps, .epx, .dwg, .dxf) and other 3D formats (.3ds, .dwg, .dfx, .fbx, .xsi, .vrml).

=== Exporting in adequate formats ===

==== Simple .fbx file export ====

In Sketchup it is really simple to export 3D files into a .fbx file:
*Select File
**Export
***3D Model
  The Export Model dialog box is displayed (Microsoft Windows).
  In the link below you can find information about the export dialog box and what settings you can conduct:
  http://sketchup.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?answer=114381
*Enter a file name for the exported file in the 'File name' (Microsoft Windows) or 'Save As' (Mac OS X) field.
*Select the FBX export type from the 'Export type' (Microsoft Windows) or 'Format' (Mac OS X) drop-down list.
*(optional) Click on the Options button. The FBX Export Options dialog box is displayed.
*(optional) Adjust the options in the FBX Export Options dialog box.
*(optional) Click the OK button.
*Click the Export button.

Now you can import the .fbx file into your XNA program. It may be more reliable than exporting it into a .x file.

==== Exporting a .x file with a plug-in ====

But there is also another possibility! Thanks to a free plug-in, we can also directely export the 3D model into a .x file to simply importing it into our XNA program.

 In the link below you can find a really nice tutorial which explains step by step the usage of this plug-in:&lt;br /&gt;

== Summary ==

=== What we learnt in this chapter ===
It seems like it is really simple to export models into .fbx or .x files and also to import them into the xna framework. But actually it only seems ike that. When you keep yourself busy with reading forums concerning the importation of 3D models, you have to assert that there are many problems which can occur. Textures are not shown, the models are shown wrong in the xna game...

To avoid those bugs aroused by the modelling software you can work with the free Autodesk Softimage Mod Tool:
 http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/pc/item?id=13571257&amp;siteID=123112

But most of you won't create models themselves. So what about our &quot;Finding free models&quot;-models? In our Introduction the &quot;normal&quot; way of importing is explained, also that for the xna framework the file extension is irrelevant.

Thus I will concentrate on the pros&amp;cons of the export of these files.

=== But is it better to export to .fbx or to .x files? ===

The diffrence between these two:
*FBX represents an entire scene within a modeling tool, with animations, modifiers, geometry and other properties, in fairly high detail
*The .X format stores only the data needed to render animated geometry at runtime - there is no explicit support for things like cameras, lights, morphers or modifiers in the format

More details about the difference can be found in the link below

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Version Control Systems =
== Overview ==

A version control system (also called revision control or source control system) is a software used to track changes in documents and binary files. It is typically used in software development to manage source code files. For every change,  a unique ID, a timestamp and the user who changed the file is saved. Thus, changes between two different versions can be easily compared and also who changed the file and when. Some systems also provide means to comment a specific version (to mark what has been changed) or give it a unique name (such as &quot;Beta 1&quot;, or &quot;Release Candidate&quot;). Since every change is saved, one can roll back or change to any version that has been saved. This also provides protection against malicious or accidental changes and serves as a backup in case of data loss.&lt;br/&gt;
There are three types of versioning control: Local, centralized and distributed systems.

=== Local Systems ===

Local systems require only a one computer. They are mostly suited for single developers, who want to have control over smaller projects they work on. Probably everyone has already used a local system, if only unintentional. Office programs like Microsoft Office or OpenOffice keep a backup of the currently open files in case of crashes or memory corruption. You may have noticed that for example Microsoft Word offers to recover a previous version of the file in case the computer crashed while the file was open. To accomplish that, the program saves a backup of the currently open file every couple of minutes, usually hidden from the user and regardless whether he also saved his document on purpose. Another example is the shadow copy service of modern Microsoft Windows versions. It keeps copies of system files that can be restored in case a file has been corrupted or damaged by a faulty update.

=== Centralized Systems ===

Centralized systems use a client-server architecture to keep track of changes. This kind of system is usually used to track multiple files or whole programming projects. A server stores an &quot;official&quot; copy of all files, folders and changes on its hard disk. This is also called a repository. A client that wants to participate in the development process first needs to acquire the files stored on a server. This procedure (the initial as well as any further pulls from the server) is called &quot;checkout&quot;, in which the whole content of the repository is copied to the local machine.&lt;br/&gt;
The client now may do changes to any file he wants to, for example adding some new procedures to a project, or improving an algorithm. After all changes are done, he needs to communicate the changes to the server. The upload of the changed files to the server is called a &quot;commit&quot;. The server keeps track of any changes the client made to the repository and adds a new &quot;revision&quot; to the server. Other users that also work on the project need to update their local repositories to the newly committed version on the server. If changes to a file overlap, a &quot;conflict&quot; occurs.  The user then has the opportunity to view the differences and may choose to merge them, depending on the versioning software used.&lt;br/&gt;
It is possible to check out any previous version that has been committed to the server.

=== Distributed Systems ===

Distributed versioning systems don't use a central repository. Instead, every users has it's own local repository, and changes are communicated through patches to other users. However, there may be a common repository where everyone publishes their changes (in most open source projects there is usually an upstream repository, but it is not mandatory). In comparison to centralized systems, which forces synchronization of all changes between all users, distributed systems focus on the sharing of changes.
This has some advantages, but may not be suited for every kind of project. For example, every developer has a local versioning control, that can be used for drafts which aren't important enough to synchronize them to a central server.

== Version Numbering ==

The more complex the project becomes, the more different versions will float around the repositories. If the developer or the team works towards a specific release (for example fixing some bugs) it is a good idea to give each release a unique version number. This helps the user to distinguish between different releases so he can see that he uses the most recent version of an application.

A widely used scheme to number versions is the usage of three digits. The first digit indicates a major version. It should only be changed if large changes occur or a lot of new functions are added. The second digit indicates a minor version. It is increments if some (larger) feature is added or a lot of bugs were fixed. The third digit displays a small change to the code, maybe a critical bugfix that has been overlooked in the previous build and needs to be fixed quickly.
Of course, one can use a totally different scheme for numbering versions, e.g. using only two digits or using the designated date of the release.


== Vocabulary ==
Most versioning software uses the same terminology as other systems, so here is a quick list of commonly used words in software versioning&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control#Common_vocabulary ''Revision control#Common Vocabulary''] Wikipedia. Received 18 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;:

;Branch: A branch is a fork or a split from the currently used code base. This is useful if experimental features are included, or if a specific part of the code gets a major overhaul.
;Checkout: Creating a local copy of any version in the repository.
;Commit: Submitting changed code to the repository.
;Conflict: A conflict can occur if different developers commit changes to the same file, and the system is unable to merge the changes without risking to break something. A conflict must be either resolved (manually), or one of the conflicting changes has to be discarded in favor of another.
;Merge: A merge is an operation where one or more changes are applied to a file. This can for example be the inclusion of a branch into the main code line, or just a small commit to the repository. Ideally, the system can merge the files automatically without any problems, but in some cases a conflict (see above) may occur.
;Repository: Contains the most recent data of the project. All changes are submitted into the repository, so that every developer can access the latest version.
;Trunk: The name of the development line, that contains the latest, bleeding-edge code of the project.
;Update: Receiving changed code from the repository, so that the local version is on par with the version in the repository.

= Versioning Software =

Popular version control systems include SVN (Subversion), Git, CVS, Mercurial and a lot more. In this part we will just look at the most widely used (SVN and Git) and explain how to use them with Visual Studio to organize and control your XNA project.

A detailed list and a comparison can be found here: [[:w:Comparison_of_revision_control_software|Comparison of revision control software]]  

== Subversion ==

=== Introduction ===
SVN stands for Subversion and is developed by the Apache Foundation. It is a centralized software versioning and revision control system, which means that it has a  central repository (project archive) that is hosted by a server and clients can access it. When users change a file locally and commit it to the repository, only the changes that were made are transferred and not the whole file. That makes the system very efficient. Also a subversion repository's size is proportional to the number of changes that were made and not the number of revisions. That keeps the repository size to a minimum.&lt;br/&gt;
The file system behind subversion uses two values to address a specific version of a specific file in the file system: the path and the revision. Every revision in a subversion file system has its own root that is used to access contents of that revision. The latest revision is called “HEAD” in SVN.

Checkins in a SVN file system are kept atomic by using transactions. That means the client either commits everything or nothing at all. This helps to avoid broken builds that were caused by check-in errors or faulty transactions. So a transaction can be committed and become the latest revision or it can be aborted anytime. &lt;br/&gt;

Subversion is seen as a further development of CVS, which is another but much older versioning system that is no longer actively developed. It improves some of the issues of CVS such as moving  files and directories or renaming them without loosing the version history. Also branching and tagging is faster in SVN, as it is  just implemented as a copy operation in the repository.


=== Client / Server Concept of SVN ===
[[File:SVN Server Client Structure.png|thumb|Client-Server Concept behind Subversion: The Server organizes a central repository and clients can update their local working copies from it and commit changes to it]]
The concept of a Subversion system is that a repository is hosted on a server and accessed by different SVN Clients through the SVN Server. Each client can checkout a working copy, work on it and submit the changes to the central repository (commit). All the other clients can then update their working copy so it is always synchronized with the newest version in the central repository.

=== Setting up a SVN Server in Windows ===

==== Installing SVN Server ====
First download the Subversion Windows MIS Installer from the official website: http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91&amp;expandFolder=91&amp;folderID=74

The current version is called: Setup-Subversion-1.6.6.msi

Then install Subversion on Windows. To check that the Subversion was successfully installed and configured open a new command window in  Windows (by clicking Start → Execute → Then enter “cmd” and press OK). In the command window type &lt;code&gt;svn help&lt;/code&gt; and you should see some help information if everything is working correctly.

==== Create a SVN Repository with SVN Server and  TortoiseSVN ====
Now we are going to create a  Subversion Repository. To do this we use another tool called TortoiseSVN, which is a popular program to access and work with SVN repositories in Windows . It is a Subversion client that is implemented as a Microsoft Windows shell extension and can be easily used within Windows Explorer.

So first download TortoiseSVN here: http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads.html
And then install. After installation new menu points should have been added to the right-click context menu in Windows Explorer that allow the use of SVN commands directly in Windows.

Then we need to create a new folder where our future repository should be stored by the server. In this example we create a folder: D:\repository

Then right-click on this new folder and choose TortoiseSVN –&gt; Create repository here…  and  TortoiseSVN will create the default structure of an empty SVN repository inside this folder.

Now to add some content to the  repository we will at first create a so called standard layout in a temporary folder and then import this folder into our new repository. So create another folder named D:\structure. Add three subfolders into this folder and call them: trunk, tags and branches. The trunk directory is the main directory of a project and will contain all versioned data.

Now to import the structure folder, right-click on it and choose TortoiseSVN –&gt; Import… . In the opening window insert the following path as “URL of repository”:

&lt;code&gt;file:///D:/repository&lt;/code&gt;

The import message should contain a comment for the version that is being imported into the repository. Write something like “First import” and then click OK. A new window should open and log all the three folders that where imported into the repository.  That is it, you can delete the temporary folder called structure because the data is now in the repository.

==== Setup Subversion Server ====
Furthermore we the security of the new repository  should be adjusted which is especially important when it is used in a network or the internet.
This means setting a security level for anonymous (everybody) and authenciated users (users that have a login and password for the repository) and configuring the user accounts with their passwords.

To do this open the file D:\repository\conf\svnserve.conf in a text editor . All config parameters are commented by default, so if you want to activate one you have to uncomment it by removing the # at the beginning of the line.
The important part is in line 12 and 13:

&lt;code&gt;anon-access = read
auth-access = write&lt;/code&gt;

The setting for the access are read, write and none. In the above case everybody can checkout the current version from the repository but only authenticated users with an account can submit changes. This is the way most open source projects operate so let's keep this setting for the moment.
If you set one or both parameters to none, nobody can read or write from the repository.

Now we just have to add a few authenticated users to test the system. To do this uncomment line 20 in the conf file that says:

&lt;code&gt;password-db = passwd&lt;/code&gt;

This means the database with the login names and passwords can be found in a file called passwd in the same directory as the svnserve.conf. So save the svnserve.conf  and open the default file passwd. A new user is defined in this file by adding a new line with the following scheme:

&lt;code&gt;username = userpassword&lt;/code&gt;

So just create a test account and save the file.

==== Use SVN Server to host a repository ====
Now it is time to use our repository, so let's host it with SVN. Open a window command line window and then execute the following:

&lt;code&gt;svnserve -d -r &quot;D:\repository&quot;&lt;/code&gt;

This should start and enable the SVN Server. Every time you want to use the Server it needs to be started this way, but this is just or test environment where we use the server and client on the same machine. Usually the SVN server is located on a separate server on the internet. 

=== Using a SVN client ===

==== Using TortoiseSVN client to checkout a working copy  ====
We are not going to work directly on the repository, because it belongs to the server and the principle behind SVN is that everybody who works on the projects checks out his own copy and works with it locally (a working copy). Usually the SVN server is a network resource that is used to checkout a copy of the project and submit the changes (commit) that were made locally.

So let's checkout a working copy from our own local SVN server and work with it. We will use TortoiseSVN for that again. Create a new folder in D:\workcopy (or any other path). Right-click on the new folder and choose SVN Checkout in the context menu.

For the URL of the repository fill in:

&lt;code&gt;svn://localhost/trunk&lt;/code&gt;

That means we make a checkout from a SVN server that happens to be set up locally (that's why we can use localhost). The folder trunk contain the latest version. Leave the rest of the settings the way they are (HEAD revision turned on) and click OK.&lt;br /&gt;
If you configured in your security setting that one needs to be an authenticated user to perform a checkout you then have to enter your login and password. Otherwise if you enabled reading for anonymous users you will not be asked.&lt;br /&gt;
A status window will tell you about the successful checkout and the revision number. The checkout is now completed and the content of the repository is now in the work copy directory. But it is empty because there are no files in our repository yet. Just one hidden directory named .svn that contains some internal SVN version history and should not be deleted.

Now we will add a simple file to the working copy and commit it to the repository with TortoiseSVN. Later we will do this directly in Visual Studio with an entire project.&lt;br /&gt;
In Windows Explorer add a text file in the workcopy checkout and then right-click it and choose: TortoiseSVN –&gt; Add…   The icon of the new file should now change from a little question mark to a blue plus symbol (if it does not, refresh with F5).

The file is now marked as something to add in the future but it is not committed yet. This is done by doing a right-click on the workcopy folder and choosing: SVN –&gt; Commit… Enter a comment (this comment should contain a short summary of the changes so it becomes more obvious what has been changed in which version of the file) and click OK. &lt;br /&gt;
You should be asked for the password and login again at this point, but you can also save it so TortoiseSVN will not ask again. It is important that you configure your SVN server so that committing is only possible for authenticated users so it is easier to keep track of who committed changes and prevent unregistered people from making unwanted changes.&lt;br /&gt;
After this step a status window should tell you about the successful commit.

==== Using SVN within Visual Studio with AnkhSVN ====

We already know the SVN Client TortoiseSVN which uses the Windows context menu to integrate SVN into Windows Explorer, but it would be even better if we could use SVN directly in Visual Studio. There are two projects offering this kind of functionality: AnkhSVN and VisualSVN. While VisualSVN is a commercial product that costs 50$ to obtain a personal license, AnkhSVN is open source and free. That is why we will just have a look at  AnkhSVN in this article.&lt;br/&gt;
AnkhSVN supports Microsoft Visual Studio 2005, 2008 and 2010. It provides an interface to perform all the important SVN operations directly within the Visual Studio Development Environment. AnkhSVN can be downloaded here:  http://ankhsvn.open.collab.net/downloads 

Install AnkhSVN and we are ready to go.

The simplest way of using the new repository is to create a new project with Visual Studio and place it inside our workcopy directory. Visual Studio should have automatically recognized that it was created inside an SVN working copy, so the SVN features and the correct address for the repository are already set.

At this point we have created a new project in an repository so all the new files have to be committed at first. To do this  AnkhSVN offers different ways inside the development environment:

* You can now open a window to view and commit changes (View → Pending changes). There you can see a list of all files that need to be committed. Just click on Commit and enter a comment as in TortoiseSVN  and everything should work.

* Another way to commit the project to the repository is by right-clicking on the solution name in the solution explorer and click “Commit solution changes”. In the solution explorer you can also see similar icons to the ones used in TortoiseSVN to show the synchronization status of each file.

* To update changes from the repository, just click update in the Pending changes view. Again there is another way by right-clicking on the solution name in the solution explorer and choosing “Update Solution to latest version” in the context menu.

* To checkout an existing visual studio project from a repository click Open → Subversion Project... Then enter the SVN server adress and find the project file in the repository. 

* Other features of SVN such as merging a branch, switching a branch, locking files and more are available through the context menu in the solution explorer as well.

You don't need to use AnkhSVN to work with Visual Studio projects inside a SVN repository. You can also use the SVN command line tool or TortoiseSVN. The only thing you should be aware of is which files you commit as Visual Studio is creating build and debug files locally on the machine in the solution directory which should not be committed but build freshly on each individuals machine.&lt;br/&gt;
You should commit the *.sln file of a Visual C# solution, but not he *.suo file (both in the main folder of the solution). You should also commit all the other files except the bin and the obj folder. By using right-click in Windows Explorer and choosing TortoiseSVN → Add to ignore list you can set these folders permanently on an ignore list so that they will not be committed to the repository.&lt;br/&gt;
If you use AnkhSVN within Visual Studio you don't have to worry about this as it will automatically just add add and commit the necessary files.

== Git ==
(Introduce principles, talk about client and server software, and how to integrate with Visual Studio.  Show how to use it, also for beginners.)

Git is a distributed version control system. It was developed by the creator of Linux, Linus Torvalds, in 2005. The emphasis of Git lies on speed and scalability with large projects. The size of the project (and thus the size of the repository) has only a minimal impact on the performance of patches&lt;ref&gt;[http://ldn.linuxfoundation.org/article/dvcs-roundup-one-system-rule-them-all-part-2#git DVCS Round-Up: One System to Rule Them All?--Part 2]. Linuxfoundation.org. Received 18. May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Introduction ===
==== Infrastructure of Git ====
Basically, git consists of three major parts that are important when using it. Since git is a distributed system, one has a ''local repository'' which is exactly what it sounds like. This is where all changes are recorded. All your changes are first committed to your local repository, and must then explicitly pushed to a remote repository. 
The files with your code lie in a ''working directory''. Between your working directory and the local repository is a ''staging area'' that gathers all changes, before they are committed to the local repository. It’s like a loading bay, where packets are stored before they are loaded into an airplane.

==== Terminology ====
[[File:git_data_flow.png|thumb|Data flow of git]]
Git uses a slightly different terminology than described in the vocabulary above. Changes are ''added'' to the staging area. A ''commit'' describes the process of adding files to the local repository from the staging area, while a ''push'' sends all changes to the remote repository.
''Fetching'' means to get all changes from the remote repository to the local repository. A ''pull'' directly copies the remote repository to the local repository.
A ''checkout'' reverts changes in your local repository and restores the state of the files either from the staging area, or the local repository.
The diagram to the right illustrates the data flow of git.


=== Usage ===
==== Git on Windows ====

There are two possibilities to use Git, either via command-line or a GUI. Former relies solely on text-based commands and works on all operating systems. Alternatively one can use graphical user interface to manage your sources. While command-line input has its advantages (such as being independent from the operating system), it effectively forces the user to learn the commands (for creating repositories, committing, updating and so on) which can slow down the development process at first. Using a GUI in our case (creating a game with XNA) is beneficial, because we can have tight integration with Visual Studio and can manage the project directly from the development environment.
There are a number of graphical tools for Git under Windows. Since TortoiseSVN is popular with SVN-users, its Git-pendant [http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/ TortoiseGit] may be a choice, but it is currently not really on-par with the SVN version. Thus, I recommend using the [http://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/ Git Extensions]. It features direct integration with Visual Studio and in combination with the [http://gitscc.codeplex.com/ Git Source Control Provider], we can have small icons displaying the status of a file in the project (such as conflicts, committing status…).

==== Install Git Extensions ====

Installation of the Git Extensions is easy, just download the [http://code.google.com/p/gitextensions/downloads/list latest version] including MsysGit (essentially a native port of Git to Windows) and KDiff3 (for comparing and merging files) and start the installer. Be sure to select “Install MSysGit” (required) and “Install KDiff” (recommended) and check if support for your Visual Studio version (2008 in our case) is selected.
After you have started Git Extensions, a checklist might pop up, remembering you to set some parameters. If the path to Git hasn’t been detected, you must point it to its installation folder. Additionally you need to specify a username, E-Mail address and the diff- and mergetools. If everything is ok, the checklist should show every point in green.


== Hosting ==

If you have your own server you can easily set up a SVN Server as described above and host your own repository. However if you work on an open source project of a smaller scale, it is advisable to just use one of the available free open source hosters . There is quite a number of free open source hosters that help to host and distribute open source projects. Most of them supply an SVN version control system and sometimes other systems such as Git or Mercurial.

So these hosters supply not only version control system which is very useful to work together on a project with a team, but  they also help to host a project for public distribution via download. Another advantage is that it is also easier to find more fellow developers for your project via this channel, because it becomes more visible for other open source developers.

An extensive list of open source hosters with a detailed comparison can be found  [[:w:Comparison_of_open_source_software_hosting_facilities|here]]. The most popular are Google Code, SourceForge and GitHub.

=== Hosting at Google Code ===
Project Hosting at Google Code is easy and you don't need to apply and wait to get accepted like at SourceForge. There are just two requirements:

* The project has to be open source.
* You need to be in a country where Google is able to conduct business (which is almost the whole world).

It is restricted to open source, because the goal of Google Code is to help open source developers with no funding that cannot afford hosting. It is recommended that the project is explicitly declared under one of the available open source licenses. So Google Code is the right choice for smaller free time projects that require hosting for efficient team work and distribution.

Every project on Google Code has its own Subversion and Mercurial repository. [[:w:Mercurial|Mercurial]] is another revision control system that is based on a distributed system and also cross-platform. 

Besides the revision control system with the repository and code hosting, Google Code also offers useful extras such as a bug tracking system, a wiki for the project that can be used for documentation and integration with mailing lists at Google Groups. All this is accessible through a simple web interface. For more information read the official Google Code FAQ: http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/FAQ

To get started for you project, you need a Google Account and follow the steps on this page: http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/GettingStarted


=== Hosting at SourceForge.net  ===

SourceForge is the world's largest open source software hosting web site. It was established in 1999 and it hosts more than 230,000 projects so far and has over 2 million registered users. The goal is similar to the goal of Google Code: Provide free services to help people to build and distribute open source software. 

It acts as a centralized location for open source software developers by providing users with several version control systems: SVN, CVS, Git, Mercurial and Baazar. Other features include project wikis, a bug tracking system, a MySQL database and a SourceForge sub-domain.

SourceForge also includes an internal ranking system that makes very active projects more visible to other developers, which is helpful to get more people join your project.

To get hosted at SourceForge you first need to apply to them and accept their terms of use (which involves granting SourceForge a perpetual license). Then the SourceForge team will decided if your project is accepted as a SourceForge project. &lt;br/&gt;
The two important criteria are that your project is producing software, documentation or an aggregate (like a linux distro) of a software and that our project is under one of the open source licenses. If it is not open source it will get rejected.&lt;br/&gt;
Generally it is a bit harder to host a very small scale private project that just started at SourceForge. Google Code is the better option because it requires no acceptance. 

To get started first register an account at [http://sourceforge.net/  SourceForge.net].


=== Hosting at Github ===

Another possibility to host your project is [http://github.com/ Github]. Creating an account and repository is free, as long as your project is open source and publicly available to everyone. You will have about 300 MByte of storage (there are no &quot;hard&quot; limits), so watch out if you push large textures or audio files to the repository. If you need restricted access, you need to pay for it. There are several paid plans available, depending on what you need.
After you have signed up, you need to create a new repository. Give it a name and optionally a description and homepage URL.

Now you need to configure Git Extensions to clone the repository to your computer, which is an awfully extensive task. Follow the [http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/ &quot;Set up SSH Keys&quot;] procedure (the last step is optional, it just checks whether everything is working). Make sure you remember the passphrase you have entered.
Now you need to create a private key file. Start puttygen.exe, select Conversions -&gt; Import. Navigate to the id_rsa file (the one without extension) and select it. Click &quot;Save private key&quot; and store it somewhere, but check that its extension is *.ppk.
Now start Git Extensions, select Clone Repository. Now you need to fill out the fields:

:''Repository to clone'': The SSH address from the source-tab at github. Should be something like &quot;git@github.com:username/projectname.git&quot;
:''Destination'': The folder where the repository is stored. (e.g. D:\Repositories)
:''Subdirectory to create'': The name of the subdirectory where the you files go into (e.g. &quot;XNA Project&quot;, the resulting path is D:\Repositories\XNA Project)

== Shaders and Effects ==

There are pixel shaders and vertex shaders.  You first need to understand the difference, how they work and what they can do for you.  Then you need to learn about the shader language HLSL, its syntax and how to use it.  Especially how to call it from the program.  Finally, you will also learn about the program called FXComposer, which shows you how to load effects, what their HLSL code is, how to modify it, and how to export and use the finished shaders in your game.

=== Development of shaders ===

In the past computer generated graphics were generated by a so called fixed-function pipeline (FFP) in the video hardware. This pipeline offered only a reduced set of operations in a certain order. This proved to be not flexible enough for the growing complexity of graphical applications like games.&lt;br /&gt;
That is why a new [[:w:Graphics_pipeline|graphics pipeline]] was introduced to replace this hard-coded approach. The new model still has some fixed compentents, but it introduced so called shaders. Shaders do the main work in rendering a scene on the screen and can be easily exchanged, programmed and adapted to the programmer's needs. This approach offers full creativity but also more responsibility to the graphics programmer.

There are two kinds of shaders: the [[:w:vertex shader|vertex shader]] and the [[:w:pixel shader|pixel shader]] (in [[:w:OpenGL|OpenGL]] called fragment shader). And with DirectX 10 and OpenGL 3.2 a third kind of shader was introduced: the [[:w:Geometry shader|Geometry shader]] that offers even further possibilities by creating additional, new vertices based on the existing ones.

Shaders describe and calculate the properties of either vertices or pixels. The vertex shader deals with vertices and their properties: their position on the screen, each vertice's texture coordinates, its color and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
The pixel shader deals with the result of the vertex shader (rasterized fragments) and describes the properties of a pixel: its color, its depth compared to other pixels on the screen (z-depth) and its alpha value.

=== Types of shaders and their function ===

Nowadays there are three types of shaders that are executed in a specific order to render the final image. The scheme shows the roles and the order of each shader in the process of sending data from XNA to the GPU and finally rendering an image. This process is called the GPU workflow:

[[File:D3D Pipeline.svg|none|Direct3D Pipeline]]

==== Vertex Shader ====

Vertex shaders are special functions that are used to manipulate the vertex data by using mathematical operations. To do this the vertex shader takes vertex data from XNA as input. That data contains the position of the vertex in the three dimensional world, its color (if it has a color), its normal vector and its texture coordinates. Using the vertex shader this data can be manipulated, but only the values are changed, not the way the data is stored.  &lt;br /&gt;
The most basic function of every vertex shader is transforming the position of each vertex from the three dimensional position in the virtual space to the two dimensional position on the screen. This is done by matrix multiplication with the view, world and projection matrix. &lt;br /&gt;
The vertex shader also calculates the depth of the vertex on the two dimensional screen (z-buffer depth), so that the original three dimensional information about the depth of objects is not lost and vertices that are closer to the viewer are displayed in front of vertices that are behind other vertices.
The vertex shader can manipulate all the input properties such as position, color, normal vectors and texture coordinates, but it cannot create new vertices. But vertex shaders can be used to change the way the object is seen. Fog, motion blur and heat wave effects can all be simulated with vertex shaders.

==== Geometry Shader ====
The next step in the pipeline is the new but only optional geometry shader. The geometry shader can add new vertices to a mesh based on the vertices that were already sent to the GPU. One way to use this is called geometry [[:w:Tessellation|tesselation]] which is the process of adding more triangles to an existing surface based on certain procedures to make it more detailed and better looking.&lt;br /&gt;
Using a geometry shader instead of an high-poly model can save a lot of CPU time, because not all of the vertices that are supposed to be later displayed on the screen have to be processed by the CPU and sent to the GPU. In some cases the polygon count can be reduced to half or a quarter.

If no geometry shader is used the output of the vertex shader goes straight to the rasterizer. If a geometry shader is used, the output also goes to the rasterizer after adding the new vertices.

==== Pixel / Fragment Shader ====
The rasterizer takes the processed vertices and turns them into fragments (pixel-sized parts of a polygon).  Whether a point, line, or polygon primitive, this stage produces fragments to &quot;fill in&quot; the polygons and interpolate all the colors and texture coordinates so that the appropriate value is assigned to each fragment.

After that the pixel shader (DirectX uses the term &quot;pixel shader,&quot; while OpenGL uses the term &quot;fragment shader&quot;) is called for each of these fragements. The Pixel shader calculates the color of an individual pixels and is used for diffuse shading (scene lightning), bump mapping, normal mapping, specular lighting and simulating reflections. Pixel shaders are generally used to provide surfaces with effects they have in real life.

The result of the pixel shader is a pixel with a certain color that is passed to the Output Merger and finally drawn onto the screen.

So the big difference between vertex and pixel shaders is that vertex shaders are used to change the attributes of the geometry (the vertices) and transform it to the 2D screen. The pixel shaders in contrast are used to change the appearance of the resulting pixels with the goal to create surface effects.


=== Programming with BasicEffect Class in XNA ===


Basic Class XNA is very useful and effective if you want to make a simple effect and lighting for your  model. It works like fixed function pipeline(FFP) which offered a limited and unflexible operation. 

To use BasicEffect class we need first to declare an instance of the BasicEffect at the top of the game class.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;BasicEffect basicEffect;&lt;/source&gt;

This instance should be initiliazed inside Initiliaze() methode because we want to initiliaze it  when the program starts. If we do this in another place that could be lead into performance problem.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;basicEffect = 
new BasicEffect(graphics.GraphicsDevice, null);&lt;/source&gt;

Next, we implement some method in the game class to draw a model with BasicEffect class. With the BasicEffect class, we don't have to create EffectParameter object for each variable. Instead, we can just assign these value into BasicEffect'  properties.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
private void DrawWithBasicEffect
(Model model, Matrix world, Matrix view, Matrix proj){    
            
	 basicEffect.World = world;
      basicEffect.View = view;
      basicEffect.Projection = proj;

      basicEffect.LightingEnabled = true;
      basicEffect.DiffuseColor = new Vector3(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
      basicEffect.SpecularColor = new Vector3(0.2f, 0.2f, 0.2f);
      basicEffect.SpecularPower = 5.0f;
      basicEffect.AmbientLightColor = 
		new Vector3(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f);

             basicEffect.DirectionalLight0.Enabled = true;
      basicEffect.DirectionalLight0.DiffuseColor = Vector3.One;
      basicEffect.DirectionalLight0.Direction =
                Vector3.Normalize(new Vector3(1.0f, 1.0f, -1.0f));
      basicEffect.DirectionalLight0.SpecularColor = Vector3.One;
      basicEffect.DirectionalLight1.Enabled = true;
      basicEffect.DirectionalLight1.DiffuseColor =
                new Vector3(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f);
      basicEffect.DirectionalLight1.Direction =
               Vector3.Normalize(new Vector3(-1.0f, -1.0f, 1.0f));
      basicEffect.DirectionalLight1.SpecularColor =
                new Vector3(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f);
}&lt;/source&gt;

After all necesarry properties have been assigned. Now our model should be drawn with BasicEffect class.
Since in a model could be have  more than one  mesh, we use foreach-loop to iterate each mesh of the model

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;private void DrawWithBasicEffect
               (Model model, Matrix world, Matrix view, Matrix proj){ 
 
       ....

       foreach (ModelMesh meshes in model.Meshes)
       {
             foreach (ModelMeshPart parts in meshes.MeshParts)
             parts.Effect = basicEffect;
             meshes.Draw();
       }
}&lt;/source&gt;

To view our model in XNA, we just call the our methode inside Draw() methode.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)
{
     GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.Black);

	DrawWithBasicEffect(myModel, world, view, proj);

	base.Draw(gameTime);
}&lt;/source&gt;


==== Draw texture with BasicEffect Class ====

To draw a texture with BasicEffect class we must enable the alpha property. After that we can assign the texture into the model.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;basicEffect.TextureEnabled = true;
basicEffect.Texture = myTexture;&lt;/source&gt;


==== Create transparency with BasicEffect class ====

First we assign the transparency value into basicEffect properties

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;basicEffect.Alpha = 0.5f;&lt;/source&gt;

then we must tell the GraphicsDevice to enable transparency with this code inside Draw() methode

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;protected void Draw(){
.....

GraphicsDevice.RenderState.AlphaBlendEnable = true;
GraphicsDevice.RenderState.SourceBlend = Blend.SourceAlpha;
GraphicsDevice.RenderState.DestinationBlend = Blend.InverseSourceAlpha;
DrawWithBasicEffect(model,world,view,projection)
GraphicsDevice.RenderState.AlphaBlendEnable = false;
.....

}&lt;/source&gt;

=== Programming your own HLSL Shaders in XNA ===

==== Shading Languages ====

Shaders are programmable and to do that several variations of a C like high-level programming languages have been developed.&lt;br /&gt;
The [[:w:High_Level_Shader_Language|High Level Shading Language (HLSL)]] was developed by Microsoft for the Microsoft Direct3D API. It uses C syntax and we will use it with the XNA Framework.&lt;br /&gt;
Other shading languages are GLSL ( OpenGL Shading Language) that is offered since OpenGL 2.0 and [[:w:Cg_(programming_language)|Cg ( C for Graphics)]] another high-level shading language that was developed by Nvidia in collaboration with Microsoft, which is very similar to HLSL. Cg is supported by FX Composer which is discussed later in this article.

==== The High Level Shading Language (HLSL) and its use in XNA ====

Shaders in XNA are written in HLSL and stored in so called effect files with the file extension .fx. It is best to keep all shaders in one separate folder. So create a new folder &quot;Shaders&quot; in the content node of the Solution Explorer in Visual C#.  To create a new Effect fx-file, simply right-click on the new &quot;Shaders&quot; folder and select Add → New Item. In the New Item dialog select &quot;Effect File&quot; and give the file a suitable name.&lt;br /&gt;
The new effect file will already contain some basic shader code that should work, but in this chapter we will write the shader from scratch, so the already generated code can be deleted.

==== Structure of a HLSL Effect-File (*.fx) ====

As already mentioned, HLSL uses C syntax and can be programmed by declaring variables, structs and writing functions. A Shader in HLSL usually consist of four different parts:

===== Variable declarations =====
Variable declarations that contain parameters and fixed constants. These variables can be set from the XNA application that is using the shader.

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float4 AmbienceColor = float4(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 1.0f);&lt;/source&gt;

With this statement a new global variable is declared and assigned. HLSL offers the standard c data types like float, string and struct but also other shader specific data types for Vectors, Matrices,  Sampler, Textures and so on. The official Reference: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb509587(v=vs.85).aspx MSDN]&lt;br /&gt;
In the example we declared a 4 dimensional vector that is used to define a color. Colors are represented by 4 values that represent the 4 channels (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha) and have a range from 0.0 to 1.0.
Variables can have arbitrary names.

===== Data structures =====
Data structures that will be used by the shaders to input and output data. Usually these are two structures: one for the input that goes into the vertex shader and one for the output of the vertex shader. The output of the vertex shader is then used as the input of the pixel shader. Usually there is no structure needed for the output of the pixel shader, because that is already the end result. If you include a Geometry Shader you need additional structures, but we will just look at the most basic example consisting of a vertex and pixel shader.
Structures can have arbitrary names.

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;struct VertexShaderInput
{
    float4 Position : POSITION0;
};&lt;/source&gt;

This data structure has one variable of the type 4 dimensional vector in it called Position (or any other name).&lt;br /&gt;
POSITION0  after the variable name is a so called semantic. All the variables in the input and output structs must be identified by semantics. A list can be found in the official HLSL Reference: [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb509647(VS.85).aspx MSDN]

===== Shader functions =====
Implementation of the shader functions and logic behind them. Usually that is one function for the vertex shader and one for the pixel shader.

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float4 PixelShaderFunction(VertexShaderOutput input) : COLOR0
{
    return AmbienceColor;
}&lt;/source&gt;

Functions are like in C: They can have parameters and return values. In this case we have a function called PixelShaderFunction (name can be arbitrary) which takes a VertexShaderOutput object as input and returns a value of the semantic COLOR0 and type float4 (4 dimensional vector representing the 4 color channels)

===== Techniques =====
A technique is like the main() method of a shader and tells the graphic card when to use what shader function. Techniques can have multiple passes that use different shader functions, so the resulting image on the screen can be composed with multiple passes.

Example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;technique Ambient
{
    pass Pass1
    {
        VertexShader = compile vs_1_1 VertexShaderFunction();
        PixelShader = compile ps_1_1 PixelShaderFunction();
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;

This example technique has the name Ambient and just one pass. In this pass the vertex and pixel shader functions are assigned and the shader version (in this case 1.1) is specified.

==== First try: A simple ambient shader ====

[[File:Ambient-shader.png|thumb|Ambient-shader]]

The simplest shader is a so called ambient shader that just assigns a fixed color to every pixel of an object so only its outline is seen. Let's implement an ambient shader as a first try.

We start with an empty .fx-File that can have an arbitrary filename. The vertex shader needs the three scene matrices to calculate the two dimensional position of a certain vertex on the screen based on the three dimensional coordinates. So we need to define three matrices inside the fx-file as variables:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float4x4 WorldMatrix;
float4x4 ViewMatrix;
float4x4 ProjectionMatrix;

float4 AmbienceColor = float4(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 1.0f);&lt;/source&gt;

A variable of the type float4x4 is a 4 dimensional matrix. The other variable is a 4 dimensional vector to determine the ambient light color (in this case a gray tone). The color values for the Ambient color are float values that represent the RGBA channels, where the minimum value is 0 and the maximum value is 1.

Next we need the input and output structures for the vertex shader:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;struct VertexShaderInput
{
    float4 Position : POSITION0;
};

struct VertexShaderOutput
{
    float4 Position : POSITION0;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Because it is a very simple shader the only data they contain at the moment is the position of the vertex in the virtual 3D space (VertexShaderInput) and the transformed position of the vertex on the two dimensional screen (VertexShaderOutput). POSITION0 is the semantic type of both positions.

Now we need to add the shader calculation itself. This is done in two functions. At first the vertex shader function:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;VertexShaderOutput VertexShaderFunction(VertexShaderInput input)
{
    VertexShaderOutput output;

    float4 worldPosition = mul(input.Position, World);
    float4 viewPosition = mul(worldPosition, View);
    output.Position = mul(viewPosition, Projection);

    return output;
}&lt;/source&gt;


This is the most basic vertex shader function and every vertex shader should look similar. The position that is saved in input is transformed by multiplying it with three scene matrices and then returning it as the result. The input is of the type VertexShaderInput and the output is of the type VertexShaderOutput. The matrix multiplication function that is used (mul) is part of the HLSL language.

Now all we need is to give the pixel shader the position that was calculated by the vertex shader and color it with the ambient color (based on the ambient intensity). The pixel shader is implemented in another function that returns the final pixel color with the data type float4 and the semantic type COLOR0:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float4 PixelShaderFunction(VertexShaderOutput input) : COLOR0
{
    return AmbienceColor;
}&lt;/source&gt;

So it should become clear why in the end result every pixel of the object will have the same color: because we don't have any lightning yet in the shader and all the three dimensional information gets lost.

To make our shader complete we need a so called technique, which is like the main() method of a shader and the function that is called by XNA when using the shader to render an object:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;technique Ambient
{
    pass Pass1
    {
        VertexShader = compile vs_1_1 VertexShaderFunction();
        PixelShader = compile ps_1_1 PixelShaderFunction();
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;

A technique has a name (in this case Ambient) which can be called directly from XNA. A technique can also have multiple passes, but in this simple case we just need one pass. In one pass it is exactly defined which function of our shader file is the vertex shader and which function is the pixel shader. We do not use a geometry shader here, because in contrast to the vertex and pixel shader it is just optional. Furthermore it is determined which shader version should be used, because the shader models are continually developed and new features are added. Possible versions are: 1.0 to 1.3, 1.4,2.0, 2.0a, 2.0b, 3.0, 4.0.&lt;br /&gt;
For the simple ambient lighting we just need version 1.1, but for reflections and other more advanced effects pixel shader version 2.0 is needed.

The complete shader code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float4x4 WorldMatrix;
float4x4 ViewMatrix;
float4x4 ProjectionMatrix;

float4 AmbienceColor = float4(0.5f, 0.5f, 0.5f, 1.0f);

struct VertexShaderInput
{
    float4 Position : POSITION0;
};

struct VertexShaderOutput
{
    float4 Position : POSITION0;
};

VertexShaderOutput VertexShaderFunction(VertexShaderInput input)
{
    VertexShaderOutput output;

    float4 worldPosition = mul(input.Position, WorldMatrix);
    float4 viewPosition = mul(worldPosition, ViewMatrix);
    output.Position = mul(viewPosition, ProjectionMatrix);

    return output;
}

float4 PixelShaderFunction(VertexShaderOutput input) : COLOR0
{
    return AmbienceColor;
}

technique Ambient
{
    pass Pass1
    {
        VertexShader = compile vs_1_1 VertexShaderFunction();
        PixelShader = compile ps_1_1 PixelShaderFunction();
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;


Now the shader file is completed and can be saved, we just need to get our XNA application to use it for rendering objects.

At first a new global variable of the type Effect has to be defined. Each Effect object is used to reference a shader which is inside a fx-file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;Effect myEffect;&lt;/source&gt;

In the method that is used to load the content from the content folder (like models, textures and so on) the shader file needs to be loaded as well (in this case it is the file Ambient.fx in the folder Shaders):

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;myEffect = Content.Load&lt;Effect&gt;(&quot;Shaders/Ambient&quot;);&lt;/source&gt;

Now the Effect is ready to use. To draw a model with our own shader we need to implement a method for that purpose:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;private void DrawModelWithEffect(Model model, Matrix world, Matrix view, Matrix projection)
        {
            foreach (ModelMesh mesh in model.Meshes)
            {
                foreach (ModelMeshPart part in mesh.MeshParts)
                {
                    part.Effect = myEffect;
                    myEffect.Parameters[&quot;World&quot;].SetValue(world * mesh.ParentBone.Transform);
                    myEffect.Parameters[&quot;View&quot;].SetValue(view);
                    myEffect.Parameters[&quot;Projection&quot;].SetValue(projection);
                }
                mesh.Draw();
            }
        }&lt;/source&gt;

The method takes the model and the three matrices that are used to describe a scene as parameters.
It loops through the meshes in the model and then trough the mesh parts in the mesh. For each part it assigns our new myEffect object to a property that is called &quot;Effect&quot; as well. &lt;br /&gt;
But before the shader is ready to use, we need to supply it with the required parameters. By using the Parameters collection of the myEffect-object we can access the variables that were defined earlier in the Shader file and give them a value. We assign the three main matrices to the equivalent variable in the shader by using the SetValue() method.
After that the mesh is ready to be drawn with the Draw() methode of the class ModelMesh.

So the new method DrawModelWithEffect() can now be called for every model of the type Model to draw it on the screen using our custom shader! The result can be seen in the picture. As you can see, every pixel of the model has the same color because we have not used any lightning, textures or effects yet.

It is also possible to change fixed variables of the shader directly in XNA by using the Parameters collection and the SetValue() method. For example to change the ambient color in the shader in the XNA application the following statement is needed:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;myEffect.Parameters[&quot;AmbienceColor&quot;].SetValue(Color.White.ToVector4());&lt;/source&gt;

==== Diffuse shading ====

[[File:Diffuse and ambient shader.png|thumb|Diffuse and ambient shader combined]]

[[File:Diffuse-only-shader.png|thumb|Only diffuse shader with no ambient lighting]]

Diffuse shading renders an object in the light that is coming from a light emitter and reflects off the object's surface in all directions (it diffuses). It is what gives most objects their shading, so that they have brightly lit parts and darker parts creating a three dimensional effect that was lost in the simple ambient shader. Now we will modify the previous ambient shader to support diffuse shading as well.
There are two ways to implement diffuse shading, one way uses the vertex shader the other uses the pixel shader. We will look at the vertex shader variant.

We need to add three new variables to the previous ambient shader file:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float4x4 WorldInverseTransposeMatrix;
float3 DiffuseLightDirection = float3(-1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
float4 DiffuseColor = float4(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);&lt;/source&gt;


The variable WorldInverseTransposeMatrix is another matrix that is needed for the calculation. It is the transpose of the inverse of the world matrix. With the ambient lighting only we did not have to care about the normal vectors of the vertices, but with the diffuse lighting this matrix becomes necessary to transform the normals of a vertex to do lighting calculations.&lt;br/&gt;
The other two variables are used to define the direction where the diffuse light comes from (first value is X, second value Y and third Z in the 3D space) and the color of the diffuse light that bounces off the surface of the rendered objects. In this case we use simply white color and the light emits in the direction of the x-axis in virtual space.

The structures for VertexShaderInput and VertexShaderOutput need some small modification as well. We have to add the following variable to the struct VertexShaderInput to get the normal vector of the current vertex in the vertex shader input:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
float4 NormalVector : NORMAL0;&lt;/source&gt;

And we add a variable for the color to the  struct VertexShaderOutput, because we will calculate the diffuse shading in the vertex shader, which will result in a color that needs to be passed to the pixel shader:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt; float4 VertexColor : COLOR0;&lt;/source&gt;

To do the diffuse lighting in the vertex shader we have to add some code to the VertexShaderFunction:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;    float4 normal = normalize(mul(input.NormalVector, WorldInverseTransposeMatrix));
    float lightIntensity = dot(normal, DiffuseLightDirection);
    output.VertexColor = saturate(DiffuseColor * lightIntensity);&lt;/source&gt;    

With this code we transform the normal of a vertex so that it is then relative to where the object is in the world (first new line).
In the second line the angle between the surface normal vector and the light that shines on it is calculated. The HLSL language offers a function dot() that calculates the dot product of two vectors, which can be used to measure the angle between two vectors. In this case the angle is equal to the intensity of the light on the surface of the vertex.
At last the color of the current vertex is calculated by multiplying the diffuse color with the intensity. This color is stored in the VertexColor property of the VertexShaderOutput struct, which is later passed to the pixel shader.

At last we have to change the value that is returned by PixelShaderFunction:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;return saturate(input.VertexColor + AmbienceColor);&lt;/source&gt;

It simply takes the color we already calculated in the vertex shader and adds the ambient component to it. The function saturate is offered by HLSL to make sure that a color is within the range between 0 and 1.

You might want to make the AmbienceColor component a bit darker so its influence on the final color is not so big. This can also be done by defining an intensity variable that regulates the intensity of a color. But we will keep things short and simple now and discuss that later.

The complete shader code:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float4x4 WorldMatrix;
float4x4 ViewMatrix;
float4x4 ProjectionMatrix;

float4 AmbienceColor = float4(0.2f, 0.2f, 0.2f, 1.0f);

// For Diffuse Lightning
float4x4 WorldInverseTransposeMatrix;
float3 DiffuseLightDirection = float3(-1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
float4 DiffuseColor = float4(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);

struct VertexShaderInput
{
    float4 Position : POSITION0;
    // For Diffuse Lightning
    float4 NormalVector : NORMAL0;
};

struct VertexShaderOutput
{
    float4 Position : POSITION0;
    // For Diffuse Lightning
    float4 VertexColor : COLOR0;
};

VertexShaderOutput VertexShaderFunction(VertexShaderInput input)
{
    VertexShaderOutput output;

    float4 worldPosition = mul(input.Position, WorldMatrix);
    float4 viewPosition = mul(worldPosition, ViewMatrix);
    output.Position = mul(viewPosition, ProjectionMatrix);
    
    // For Diffuse Lightning
    float4 normal = normalize(mul(input.NormalVector, WorldInverseTransposeMatrix));
    float lightIntensity = dot(normal, DiffuseLightDirection);
    output.VertexColor = saturate(DiffuseColor * lightIntensity);    

    return output;
}

float4 PixelShaderFunction(VertexShaderOutput input) : COLOR0
{
    return saturate(input.VertexColor + AmbienceColor);
}

technique Diffuse
{
    pass Pass1
    {
        VertexShader = compile vs_1_1 VertexShaderFunction();
        PixelShader = compile ps_1_1 PixelShaderFunction();
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;

That is it for the shader file. To use the new shader in XNA we have to make one addition to the XNA application that uses the shader to render objects:

We have to set the WorldInverseTransposeMatrix variable of the shader in XNA. So right in the DrawModelWithEffect method in the part where the other parameters of the object myEffect are set by using SetValue() we have to set the WorldInverseTransposeMatrix. But before setting it, it needs to be calculated. For that we invert and then transpose the world matrix of our application (Which is multiplied with the objects transformation first, so everything is at the right place).

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt; Matrix worldInverseTransposeMatrix = Matrix.Transpose(Matrix.Invert(mesh.ParentBone.Transform * world));
 myEffect.Parameters[&quot;WorldInverseTransposeMatrix&quot;].SetValue(worldInverseTransposeMatrix);&lt;/source&gt;

That is all that needs to be changed in the XNA code. Now you should have nice diffuse lighting. You can see the result in the pictures. Remember this shader is already using diffuse and ambient lighting, that is why the dark parts of the model are just gray and not black.

If we modify the pixel shader to just return the vertex color without adding the ambient light, the scene looks different (second picture):

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt; return saturate(input.VertexColor);&lt;/source&gt;

The dark parts of the model where there is no light are now completely black because they no longer have an ambient component added to them.

==== Texture Shader ====

[[File:Texture-shader.png|thumb|Texture, Diffusion and Ambient Shader combined]]

Applying and rendering textures on an object based on texture coordinates is also done with shaders. To adapt the previous diffuse shader to work with textures we have to add the following variable:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;texture ModelTexture;
sampler2D TextureSampler = sampler_state {
    Texture = (ModelTexture);
    MagFilter = Linear;
    MinFilter = Linear;
    AddressU = Clamp;
    AddressV = Clamp;
};&lt;/source&gt;

ModelTexture is of the HLSL data type texture and stores the texture that should be rendered on the model. Another variable of the type sampler2D is associated to the texture. A sampler tells the graphic card how to extract the color for one pixel from the texture file. The sampler contains five properties:

* '''Texture:''' Which texture file to use.
* '''MagFilter + MinFilter:''' Which filter should be used to scale the texture. Some filters are faster than others, other filters look better. Possible values are: Linear, None, Point, Anisotropic
* '''AddressU +  AddressV:''' Determine what to do when the U or V coordinate is not in the normal range (between 0 and 1). Possible values: Clamp, Border Color, Wrap, Mirror.

We use the Linear filter which is fast and Clamp, which just uses the value 0 if the U/V value is lesser than 0 and the value 1 if the U/V Value is greater than 1.

Next we add texture coordinates to the output and input structs of the vertex shader so this kind of information can be collected by the vertex shader and forwarded to the pixel shader.

Add to struct VertexShaderInput:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;    float2 TextureCoordinate : TEXCOORD0;&lt;/source&gt;

And add to struct VertexShaderOutput:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt; 
     float2 TextureCoordinate : TEXCOORD0;&lt;/source&gt;


Both are of the type float2 (a two-dimensional vector) because we just need to store two components: U and V. Both variables also have the semantic type TEXCOORD0.

The step of applying the color of the texture to the object happens in the pixel shader, but not in the vertex shader. So in the VertexShaderFunction we just take the textureCoordinate from the input and put it into the output:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;output.TextureCoordinate = input.TextureCoordinate;&lt;/source&gt;

In the  PixelShaderFunction we then do the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float4 PixelShaderFunction(VertexShaderOutput input) : COLOR0
{
	float4 VertexTextureColor = tex2D(TextureSampler, input.TextureCoordinate);
	VertexTextureColor.a = 1;
	
	return saturate(VertexTextureColor * input.VertexColor + AmbienceColor);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The function now calculates the color of the pixel based on the texture. Additionally the alpha value for the color is set separately in the second line, because the TextureSampler does not get the alpha value from the texture.&lt;br /&gt;
Finally in the return statement the texture color of the vertex is multiplied by the diffuse color (which adds diffuse shading to the texture color) and the ambient color is added as usual.


We also need to make a change in the technique function this time. The new PixelShaderFunction is now to sophisticated for pixel shader version 1.1, so it needs to be set to version 2.0:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;PixelShader = compile ps_2_0 PixelShaderFunction();&lt;/source&gt;


The complete shader code for the texture shader:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float4x4 WorldMatrix;
float4x4 ViewMatrix;
float4x4 ProjectionMatrix;

float4 AmbienceColor = float4(0.1f, 0.1f, 0.1f, 1.0f);

// For Diffuse Lightning
float4x4 WorldInverseTransposeMatrix;
float3 DiffuseLightDirection = float3(-1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
float4 DiffuseColor = float4(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);

// For Texture
texture ModelTexture;
sampler2D TextureSampler = sampler_state {
    Texture = (ModelTexture);
    MagFilter = Linear;
    MinFilter = Linear;
    AddressU = Clamp;
    AddressV = Clamp;
};

struct VertexShaderInput
{
    float4 Position : POSITION0;
    // For Diffuse Lightning
    float4 NormalVector : NORMAL0;
    // For Texture
    float2 TextureCoordinate : TEXCOORD0;
};

struct VertexShaderOutput
{
    float4 Position : POSITION0;
    // For Diffuse Lightning
    float4 VertexColor : COLOR0;
    // For Texture    
    float2 TextureCoordinate : TEXCOORD0;
};

VertexShaderOutput VertexShaderFunction(VertexShaderInput input)
{
    VertexShaderOutput output;

    float4 worldPosition = mul(input.Position, WorldMatrix);
    float4 viewPosition = mul(worldPosition, ViewMatrix);
    output.Position = mul(viewPosition, ProjectionMatrix);
    
    // For Diffuse Lightning
    float4 normal = normalize(mul(input.NormalVector, WorldInverseTransposeMatrix));
    float lightIntensity = dot(normal, DiffuseLightDirection);
    output.VertexColor = saturate(DiffuseColor * lightIntensity);    
    
    // For Texture
	output.TextureCoordinate = input.TextureCoordinate;
	
    return output;
}

float4 PixelShaderFunction(VertexShaderOutput input) : COLOR0
{
    // For Texture
	float4 VertexTextureColor = tex2D(TextureSampler, input.TextureCoordinate);
	VertexTextureColor.a = 1;
	
	return saturate(VertexTextureColor * input.VertexColor + AmbienceColor);
}

technique Texture
{
    pass Pass1
    {
        VertexShader = compile vs_1_1 VertexShaderFunction();
        PixelShader = compile ps_2_0 PixelShaderFunction();
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;

Changes in XNA:

In the XNA Code we have to add a new texture by declaring a Texture2D object:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
        Texture2D planeTexture;&lt;/source&gt;

Load the texture by loading a previously added image of the content node (in this case a file called &quot;planetextur.png&quot; that is located in the folder &quot;Images&quot; of the content node of the solution explorer) :

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;planeTexture = Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(&quot;Images/planetextur&quot;);&lt;/source&gt;


And finally assign the new texture to the shader variable ModelTexture in our usual draw method:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;myEffect.Parameters[&quot;ModelTexture&quot;].SetValue(planeTexture);&lt;/source&gt;

The object should then have a texture, diffuse shading and ambient shading as you can see in the sample image.

==== Advanced Shading with Specular Lighting and Reflections ====

[[File:Reflection-shader.png|thumb|Textur, Reflection and Specular Shading combined]]

Now let's create a new more sophisticated effect that looks really nice and real and can be used to simulate shiny surfaces like metal. We will combine a texture shader with a specular shader and a reflection shader. The reflection shader will reflect a predefined environment

The specular lighting adds shiny spots on the surface of a model to simulate smoothness. They have the color of the light that is shining on the surface.&lt;br /&gt;
The difference of specular lighting to the shaders we have used before is that it is not only influenced by the direction the light comes from, but also the direction from which the viewer is looking at the object. So as the camera moves in the scene, the specular lighting is moving around on the surface.

The same goes for the reflection shader, based on the position of a viewer the reflection on an objects surface is changing.&lt;br /&gt;
Calculating  reflections like in the real world would mean to calculate single rays of light bouncing off surfaces (a technique called ray tracing). This requires way to much calculation power which is why we use a simpler approach in real time computer graphics like XNA. The technique we use is called environment mapping and maps the image of an environment onto an object's surface. This environment mapping is moved when the viewers position is changing so the illusion of a reflection is created. This has some limitations, for example the object only reflects a predefined environment image and not the real scene. Therefore the player and all other moving models will not be reflected. This has some limitations, but they are not very noticeable in a real time application.&lt;br /&gt;
The environment map could be the same as the skybox of a scene. More about the skybox in another article: [[Game Creation with XNA/3D Development/Skybox]]. If the environment map is the same as the skybox it will fit to the scene and look accurate, however you can use whatever environment mapping looks good on the model in the scene.

The basis for the following changes is the previously developed texture shader. For specular lighting the following variables need to be added:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float ShininessFactor = 10.0f;
float4 SpecularColor = float4(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);    
float3 ViewVector = float3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
&lt;/source&gt;

The  ShininessFactor defines how shiny the surface is. A low value stands for a surface with broad surfaces highlights and should be used for less shiny surfaces. A high value stands for shinier surfaces like metal with small but very intense surface highlights. A mirror would have an infinite value in theory.&lt;br /&gt;
The  SpecularColor specifies the color of the specular light. In this case we use white light.&lt;br /&gt;
The ViewVector is a variable that will be calculated and set from the XNA applicaton at run time. It tells the shader which direction the viewer is looking at.

For the reflection shader we need to add the environment texture and a sampler as variables:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;Texture EnvironmentTexture; 
samplerCUBE EnvironmentSampler = sampler_state 
{ 
   texture = &lt;EnvironmentTexture&gt;; 
   magfilter = LINEAR; 
   minfilter = LINEAR; 
   mipfilter = LINEAR; 
   AddressU = Mirror; 
   AddressV = Mirror; 
};&lt;/source&gt;


The EnvironmentTexture is the environment image that will be mapped as a reflection on our object. This time a cube sampler is used which is a little bit different from the previously used 2D sampler. It assumes that the supplied texture is created to be rendered on a cube.

No changes need to be made in the VertexShaderInput struct, but two new variables need to be added to the struct VertexShaderOutput:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;    float3 NormalVector : TEXCOORD1;
    float3 ReflectionVector : TEXCOORD2;&lt;/source&gt;


NormalVector is just the normal vector of a single vertex that comes directly from the input. The reflection vector is calculated in the vertex shader and used in the pixel shader to assign the right part from the environment map to the surface. Both are of the semantic type TEXCOORD. There is already one variable of thetype TEXCOORD0 (TextureCoordinate) so we count further to 1 and 2.

In the  VertexShaderFunction we have to add the following commands:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;	 // For Specular Lighting
	output.NormalVector = normal;
	
	// For Reflection
    float4 VertexPosition = mul(input.Position, WorldMatrix);
    float3 ViewDirection = ViewVector - VertexPosition; 
    output.ReflectionVector = reflect(-normalize(ViewDirection), normalize(normal));&lt;/source&gt;


At first the previously calculated normal vector of the current vertex is written to the output, because it is later needed for specular shading in the pixel shader.&lt;br /&gt;
For the reflection the vertex position in the world is calculated along with the direction the viewer looks on the vertex. Then the reflection vector is calculated using the HLSL function reflect() that uses normalized values of the previously calculated normal and ViewDirection vector. 

To the  PixelShaderFunction we add the following calculations for the specular value:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;    float3 light = normalize(DiffuseLightDirection);
    float3 normal = normalize(input.NormalVector);
    float3 r = normalize(2 * dot(light, normal) * normal - light);
    float3 v = normalize(mul(normalize(ViewVector), WorldMatrix));

    float dotProduct = dot(r, v);
    float4 specular = SpecularColor * max(pow(dotProduct, ShininessFactor), 0) * length(input.VertexColor);&lt;/source&gt;

So to calculate the specular highlight the diffuse light direction, the normal, the view vector and the shininess is needed. The end result is another vector that contains the specular component.	

This specular component is added along with the reflection to the return statement at the end of the PixelShaderFunction:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;	return saturate(VertexTextureColor *  texCUBE(EnvironmentSampler, normalize(input.ReflectionVector)) + specular * 2);&lt;/source&gt;

In this case we got rid of the diffuse and ambient component because it is not necessary for this demonstration and looks even better without it in this case. Without the diffuse lighting component, it looks like the light comes from everywhere and reflects on shiny metal.&lt;br /&gt;
So in the return statement the texture color is used along with the reflection and the specular highlight (multiplied by 2 to make it more intense).

The finished shader code:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
float4x4 WorldMatrix;
float4x4 ViewMatrix;
float4x4 ProjectionMatrix;

float4 AmbienceColor = float4(0.1f, 0.1f, 0.1f, 1.0f);

// For Diffuse Lightning
float4x4 WorldInverseTransposeMatrix;
float3 DiffuseLightDirection = float3(-1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
float4 DiffuseColor = float4(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);

// For Texture
texture ModelTexture;
sampler2D TextureSampler = sampler_state {
    Texture = (ModelTexture);
    MagFilter = Linear;
    MinFilter = Linear;
    AddressU = Clamp;
    AddressV = Clamp;
};

// For Specular Lighting
float ShininessFactor = 10.0f;
float4 SpecularColor = float4(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);    
float3 ViewVector = float3(1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);

// For Reflection Lighting
Texture EnvironmentTexture; 
samplerCUBE EnvironmentSampler = sampler_state 
{ 
   texture = &lt;EnvironmentTexture&gt;; 
   magfilter = LINEAR; 
   minfilter = LINEAR; 
   mipfilter = LINEAR; 
   AddressU = Mirror; 
   AddressV = Mirror; 
};

{
    float4 Position : POSITION0;

	// For Reflection

};

VertexShaderOutput VertexShaderFunction(VertexShaderInput input)
{
    VertexShaderOutput output;

    float4 worldPosition = mul(input.Position, WorldMatrix);
    float4 viewPosition = mul(worldPosition, ViewMatrix);
    output.Position = mul(viewPosition, ProjectionMatrix);
    
    // For Diffuse Lighting
    float4 normal = normalize(mul(input.NormalVector, WorldInverseTransposeMatrix));
    float lightIntensity = dot(normal, DiffuseLightDirection);
    output.VertexColor = saturate(DiffuseColor * lightIntensity);

	 // For Specular Lighting
	output.NormalVector = normal;
	
	// For Reflection
    float4 VertexPosition = mul(input.Position, WorldMatrix);
    float3 ViewDirection = ViewVector - VertexPosition; 
    output.ReflectionVector = reflect(-normalize(ViewDirection), normalize(normal));
	
    return output;
}

float4 PixelShaderFunction(VertexShaderOutput input) : COLOR0
{
    // For Texture
	float4 VertexTextureColor = tex2D(TextureSampler, input.TextureCoordinate);
	VertexTextureColor.a = 1;
	
    // For Specular Lighting
    float3 light = normalize(DiffuseLightDirection);
    float3 normal = normalize(input.NormalVector);
    float3 r = normalize(2 * dot(light, normal) * normal - light);
    float3 v = normalize(mul(normalize(ViewVector), WorldMatrix));
    
    float dotProduct = dot(r, v);
    float4 specular = SpecularColor * max(pow(dotProduct, ShininessFactor), 0) * length(input.VertexColor);

	
	return saturate(VertexTextureColor *  texCUBE(EnvironmentSampler, normalize(input.ReflectionVector)) + specular * 2);
}

technique Reflection
{
    pass Pass1
    {
        VertexShader = compile vs_1_1 VertexShaderFunction();
        PixelShader = compile ps_2_0 PixelShaderFunction();
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;


To use the new shader in XNA we need to set 2 additional shader variables from XNA in the draw method:


&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;                    myEffect.Parameters[&quot;ViewVector&quot;].SetValue(viewDirectionVector);
                    myEffect.Parameters[&quot;EnvironmentTexture&quot;].SetValue(environmentTexture);&lt;/source&gt;


But at first the object environmentTexture should be declared and loaded first (as usual):

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;TextureCube environmentTexture;

environmentTexture = Content.Load&lt;TextureCube&gt;(&quot;Images/Skybox&quot;);&lt;/source&gt;

In contrast to the model texture, this texture is not of the type Texture2D but the type TextureCube because in our case we use a skybox texture as environment map. A skybox texture consists not only of one image like a regular texture, but six different images that are mapped on each side of a cube. The images have to fit together in the right angle and be seamless. You can find some skybox textures here: [http://rbwhitaker.wikidot.com/texture-library RB Whitaker Skybox Textures]

Secondly the viewDirectionVector we use to set the ViewVector variable in the reflection shader should be declared in the class as a field:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;Vector3 viewDirectionVector = new Vector3(0, 0, 0);&lt;/source&gt;

It can be calculated this way:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;viewDirectionVector = cameraPositionVector – cameraTargetVector;&lt;/source&gt;

Whereby cameraPositionVector is a 3D vector containing the current position of the camera and  cameraTargetVector is another vector with the coordinates of the camera target.
If for example the camera is just looking at the point 0,0,0 in the virtual space, the calculation would be even shorter:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;viewDirectionVector = cameraPositionVector;
//or
viewDirectionVector =  new Vector3(eyePositionX, eyePositionY, eyePositionZ);&lt;/source&gt;

With all these changes in the XNA game the reflection should look like in the picture. But the appearance largely depends on the environment map used.

==== Additional Parameters ====

Another good idea would be to introduce parameters for the intensity of a shader. For example instead of simply returning the ambient color in the return statement of the pixel shader function in the diffusion shader above:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;return saturate(input.VertexColor + AmbienceColor);&lt;/source&gt;

One could return:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;return saturate(input.VertexColor + AmbienceColor * AmbienceIntensity);&lt;/source&gt;

Whereby AmbienceIntensity is a float between 0.0 and 1.0. This way the intensity of the color can be easily adjusted.
This can be done with every component we have calculated so far (ambient, diffusion, textur color, specular intensity, reflection component).

==== Postprocessing with shaders ====

[[File:Postproessing-red-shader.png|thumb|Post-processing shader in XNA that displays only the red channel]]

Until now we have worked with 3D shaders but 2D shaders are also possible. A 2D image can be modified and processed by a picture editing software such as Photoshop to adapt its contrast, colors and apply filters. The same can be achieved with 2D shaders that are applied on the entire output image that is the result of rendering the scene. 

Examples for the kinds of effects that can be achieved:

* Simple color modifications like making the scene black and white, inverting the color channels, giving the scene a sepia look and so on.
* Adapting the colors to create a warm or cold mood in the scene.
* Blur the screen with a blur filter to create special effects.
* [[:w:Bloom_(shader_effect)|Bloom Effect]]: A popular effect that produces fringes of light around very bright objects in an image simulating an effect known from photography.

So to start we create a new shader file in Visual Studio (call it Postprocessing .fx) and insert the following code for post-processing

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;texture ScreenTexture;
sampler TextureSampler = sampler_state
{
    Texture = &lt;ScreenTexture&gt;;
};

float4 PixelShaderFunction(float2 TextureCoordinate : TEXCOORD0) : COLOR0
{
    float4 pixelColor = tex2D(TextureSampler, TextureCoordinate);
 	
	pixelColor.g = 0;
	pixelColor.b = 0;
	
    return pixelColor;
}
 
technique Grayscale
{
    pass Pass1
    {
        PixelShader = compile ps_2_0 PixelShaderFunction();
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;

As you can see for the post-processing we only need a pixel shader. The post-processing is handled by supplying the rendered image of the scene as a texture which is then used by a pixel shader as input information, processed and returned.&lt;br /&gt;
The function has only one input parameter (the texture coordinate) and returns a color vector of the semantic type COLOR0. In this example we just read the color of the pixel at the current texture coordinate (which is the screen coordinate) and set the green and blue channel to 0 so that only the red channel is left.
Then we return the color value.

Now using this 2D shader in XNA is a bit more tricky.  At first we need the following objects in the Game class:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;        
GraphicsDeviceManager graphics;
SpriteBatch spriteBatch;
RenderTarget2D renderTarget;
Effect postProcessingEffect;&lt;/source&gt;

It is very likely that the  GraphicsDeviceManager and SpriteBatch object is already created in an existing project. However the  RenderTarget2D and  Effect object have to be declared.

Check that the GraphicsDeviceManager object is initialized in the constructor:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);&lt;/source&gt;

And the  SpriteBatch object is initialized in the LoadContent() method. The new shader file we just created should be loaded in this method as well:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);
postProcessingEffect = Content.Load&lt;Effect&gt;(&quot;Shaders/Postprocessing&quot;);&lt;/source&gt;

Finally make sure that the  RenderTarget2D object is initialized in the method Initialize():

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
            renderTarget = new RenderTarget2D(
            				GraphicsDevice,
            				GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters.BackBufferWidth,
            				GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters.BackBufferHeight,
             				1,
             				GraphicsDevice.PresentationParameters.BackBufferFormat
	    );
&lt;/source&gt;


Now we need a method to draw the current scene to a texture (in form of a render target) instead of the screen:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;        protected Texture2D DrawSceneToTexture(RenderTarget2D currentRenderTarget) {
            // Set the render target
            GraphicsDevice.SetRenderTarget(0, currentRenderTarget);

            // Draw the scene
            GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.Black);

            drawModelWithTexture(model, world, view, projection);

            // Drop the render target
            GraphicsDevice.SetRenderTarget(0, null);

            // Return the texture in the render target
            return currentRenderTarget.GetTexture();
        }&lt;/source&gt;


Inside this method we use the draw function that is using our 3D shader (in this case:  drawModelWithTexture()). So we still use all the 3D shaders to render the scene first, but instead of displaying this result directly, we render it to a texture and do some post-processing with it in the Draw() method. After that the processed texture is displayed on the screen. So extend the Draw() method with this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;          protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)
        {
            Texture2D texture = DrawSceneToTexture(renderTarget);

            GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.Black);

            spriteBatch.Begin(SpriteBlendMode.AlphaBlend, SpriteSortMode.Immediate, SaveStateMode.SaveState);
            postProcessingEffect.Begin();
            postProcessingEffect.CurrentTechnique.Passes[0].Begin();

            spriteBatch.Draw(texture, new Rectangle(0, 0, 1024, 768), Color.White);

            postProcessingEffect.CurrentTechnique.Passes[0].End();
            postProcessingEffect.End();
            spriteBatch.End();

            base.Draw(gameTime);
        }&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:Postproessing-5colors-shader.png|thumb|Post-processing shader in XNA that displays only 5 gray tones]]

At first the normal scene is rendered to a texture named texture. Then a sprite batch is started along with the postProcessing effect  that contains our new post-processing shader. The texture is then rendered on the sprite batch with the postProcessing Effect applied to it.

The effect should look like in the picture.

Another simple effect that can be achieved with a post-processing shader is converting the color image to a gray scale image and then reducing it to 4 colors, which creates a cartoon-like effect. To achieve this, the 
PixelShaderFunction inside our shader file should look like this:


&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float4 PixelShaderFunction(float2 TextureCoordinate : TEXCOORD0) : COLOR0
{
    float4 pixelColor = tex2D(TextureSampler, TextureCoordinate);
 
    float average = (pixelColor.r + pixelColor.g + pixelColor.b) / 3; 
    
	if (average &gt; 0.95){
		average = 1.0;
	} else if (average &gt; 0.5){
		average = 0.7;
	}  else if (average &gt; 0.2){
		average = 0.35;
	} else{
		average = 0.1;
	}
        
	pixelColor.r = average;
	pixelColor.g = average;
	pixelColor.b = average;

    return pixelColor;
}&lt;/source&gt;

A gray scale image is generated by calculating the average of the red, green and blue channel and using this one value for all three channels. After that the average value is additionally reduced to one of 4 different values. At last the red, green and blue channel of the output is set to the reduced value. The image is grayscale because the red, green and blue channel all have the same value.

==== Create tansparency Shader ====
[[File:Transparency Shader XNA.png|thumb|Add caption here]]

Create a tranparency shader is easy. We can start with diffuse shader example from above. First we need some variable called alpha to determine the transparency. The value should be between 1 for opaque and 0 for complete transparent.
To implement the transparency shader we  just need some modification in PixelShaderFunction. After all lighting calculation have been done, we must assign the alpha value into result color properties.




&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
float alpha = 0.5f;

float4 PixelShaderFunction(VertexShaderOutput input) : COLOR0
{
    float4 color =  saturate(input.VertexColor + AmbienceColor);
    color.a = alpha;
    return color;
}&lt;/source&gt;

to enable alpha blending we must add some code in technique

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;technique Tranparency {
    pass p0 {
        AlphaBlendEnable = TRUE;
        DestBlend = INVSRCALPHA;
        SrcBlend = SRCALPHA;

        VertexShader = compile vs_2_0 std_VS();
        PixelShader = compile ps_2_0 std_PS();
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;

The complete transparency shader
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float4x4 WorldMatrix;
float4x4 ViewMatrix;
float4x4 ProjectionMatrix;
 
float4 AmbienceColor = float4(0.2f, 0.2f, 0.2f, 1.0f);
 
// For Diffuse Lightning
float4x4 WorldInverseTransposeMatrix;
float3 DiffuseLightDirection = float3(-1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
float4 DiffuseColor = float4(1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
 
struct VertexShaderInput
{
    float4 Position : POSITION0;
    // For Diffuse Lightning
    float4 NormalVector : NORMAL0;
};
 
struct VertexShaderOutput
{
    float4 Position : POSITION0;
    // For Diffuse Lightning
    float4 VertexColor : COLOR0;
};
 
VertexShaderOutput VertexShaderFunction(VertexShaderInput input)
{
    VertexShaderOutput output;
 
    float4 worldPosition = mul(input.Position, WorldMatrix);
    float4 viewPosition = mul(worldPosition, ViewMatrix);
    output.Position = mul(viewPosition, ProjectionMatrix);
 
    // For Diffuse Lightning
    float4 normal = normalize(mul(input.NormalVector, WorldInverseTransposeMatrix));
    float lightIntensity = dot(normal, DiffuseLightDirection);
    output.VertexColor = saturate(DiffuseColor * lightIntensity);    
 
    return output;
}
 
float4 PixelShaderFunction(VertexShaderOutput input) : COLOR0
{
    float4 color =  saturate(input.VertexColor + AmbienceColor);
    color.a = alpha;
    return color;
}
 
technique Diffuse
{
    pass Pass1
    {		
	AlphaBlendEnable = TRUE;
        DestBlend = INVSRCALPHA;
        SrcBlend = SRCALPHA;

        VertexShader = compile vs_1_1 VertexShaderFunction();
        PixelShader = compile ps_1_1 PixelShaderFunction();
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;

==== Other kinds of shaders ====

A few other popular shaders with a short description.

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Bump-map-demo-full.png|Bump Mapping applied on the even surface of a sphere
File:Normal_map_example.png|Adding details back to a low-poly model by using normal mapping
File:Toon-shader.jpg|Toon Shader
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===== Bump Map Shader =====
[[:w:Bump_mapping|Bump Mapping]] is used to simulate bumps on otherwise even polygon surfaces to make a surface look more realistic and give it some structure, additionally to the texture.
Bump Mapping is achieved by loading another texture that contains the bump information and perturbing the surface normals with this information. The original normal of a surface is changed by an offset value that comes from the bump map. Bump maps are grayscale images.

===== Normal Map Shader =====
Bump Mapping is nowadays replaced by [[:w:Normal_mapping|normal mapping]]. Normal mapping is also used to create bumpiness and structures on otherwise even polygon surfaces. But normal mapping handles drastic variations in normals better than bump mapping.&lt;br /&gt;
Normal Mapping is a similar idea to bump mapping: another texture is loaded and used to change the normals. But instead of just changing the normals with an offset a normal map uses a multichannel (RGB) map to completely replace the existing normals. R, G and B values of each pixel in the normal map correspond to the X,Y,Z coordinates of the normal vector of a vertex.&lt;br /&gt;
The further development of normal mapping is called [[:w:Parallax_mapping|parallax mapping]].

===== Cel Shader (Toon Shader) =====
A [[:w:Cel-shaded_animation|Cel Shader]] is used to render a 3D scene in a cartoon-like look so that it appears to be drawn by hand. Cel Shading can be implemented in XNA with a multi-pass shader that builds the result image in several passes.

===== Toon Shader Example =====

[[File:Toon Shader XNA.png|thumb|Toon Shader]]

To create toon shader we can start from diffuse shader. The basic idea behind toon shader is that the light intensity will be divided into several levels. In this example we create the intensity into 5 levels. To represents the lightness level  we need some array variable called toonthresholds and to determine the boundary between levels we use array toonBrightnessLevels.








&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float ToonThresholds[4] = {0.95,0.5, 0.2, 0.03 };
float ToonBrightnessLevels[5] = { 1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.35, 0.01 };&lt;/source&gt;

now in PixelShader we implement the classification of light intensity and assign into it an appropriate color.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float4 std_PS(VertexShaderOutput input) : COLOR0 {

	float lightIntensity = dot(normalize(DiffuseLightDirection),
             input.normal);
    if(lightIntensity &lt; 0)
        lightIntensity = 0;
		
	float4 color = tex2D(colorSampler, input.uv) * 
                   DiffuseLightColor * DiffuseIntensity;
    color.a = 1;
	
    if (lightIntensity &gt; ToonThresholds[0])
        color *= ToonBrightnessLevels[0];
	else if ( lightIntensity &gt; ToonThresholds[1])
        color *= ToonBrightnessLevels[1];
    else if ( lightIntensity &gt; ToonThresholds[2])
        color *= ToonBrightnessLevels[2];
    else if ( lightIntensity &gt; ToonThresholds[3])
        color *= ToonBrightnessLevels[3];
    else
        color *= ToonBrightnessLevels[4];
			return color;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Using FXComposer to create shaders for XNA ===

FX Composer is a integrated development environmet for shader authoring. Using FX Composer to create our own shader is very helpful. With Fx Composer we can see the result soon and it is very efficient to make some experiment with the shader.

==== Using FX Composer shader library into XNA ====
[[File:Metallic Shader XNA.png|thumb|Metal Shader]]


In this example I use FX Composer version 2.5. using FX Composer library into your own XNA is very easy task. Let just start it with example.
Open your FX Composer and create some new Project. In Material click right mouse and choose  „Add Material From File“ and choose metal.fx.

All you need is copy all the codes from metal.fx and create new effect in your XNA project and replace all the content with the codes from metal fx. You can also copy the file metal.fx into put it into your XNA project.

From this, all we need is some modification in XNA class based on variables in metal.fx

in metal.fx you can see this code :

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// transform object vertices to world-space:
float4x4 gWorldXf : World &lt; string UIWidget=&quot;None&quot;; &gt;;
// transform object normals, tangents, &amp; binormals to world-space:
float4x4 gWorldITXf : WorldInverseTranspose &lt; string UIWidget=&quot;None&quot;; &gt;;
// transform object vertices to view space and project them in perspective:
float4x4 gWvpXf : WorldViewProjection &lt; string UIWidget=&quot;None&quot;; &gt;;
// provide tranform from &quot;view&quot; or &quot;eye&quot; coords back to world-space:
float4x4 gViewIXf : ViewInverse &lt; string UIWidget=&quot;None&quot;; &gt;;&lt;/source&gt;

In our XNA Class we must change the ParameterEffect name.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;Matrix InverseWorldMatrix = Matrix.Invert(world);
     Matrix ViewInverse = Matrix.Invert(view);


     effect.Parameters[&quot;gWorldXf&quot;].SetValue(world);
     effect.Parameters[&quot;gWorldITXf&quot;].SetValue(InverseWorldMatrix);
     effect.Parameters[&quot;gWvpXf&quot;].SetValue(world*view*proj);
     effect.Parameters[&quot;gViewIXf&quot;].SetValue(ViewInverse);&lt;/source&gt;

we must also change the technique name in XNA class. Because XNA use directX9 we choose the “technique Simple”

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;effect.CurrentTechnique = effect.Techniques[&quot;Simple&quot;];&lt;/source&gt;

Now you can run the code with metal effect.

the complete function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;private void DrawWithMetalEffect(Model model, Matrix world, Matrix view, Matrix proj){ 
 
     Matrix InverseWorldMatrix = Matrix.Invert(world);
     Matrix ViewInverse = Matrix.Invert(view);
	
	effect.CurrentTechnique = effect.Techniques[&quot;Simple&quot;];
     effect.Parameters[&quot;gWorldXf&quot;].SetValue(world);
     effect.Parameters[&quot;gWorldITXf&quot;].SetValue(InverseWorldMatrix);
     effect.Parameters[&quot;gWvpXf&quot;].SetValue(world*view*proj);
     effect.Parameters[&quot;gViewIXf&quot;].SetValue(ViewInverse);

       foreach (ModelMesh meshes in model.Meshes)
       {
             foreach (ModelMeshPart parts in meshes.MeshParts)
             parts.Effect = basicEffect;
             meshes.Draw();
       }
}&lt;/source&gt;

=== Particle Effects ===
[[File:PointSprite Shader XNA.png|thumb|Point Sprite Shader]]
to create particle effect in XNA we use a point sprite. A point sprite is a resizable textured vertex that always faces the camera. There are several reasons why we use pointsprite for
rendering particles
*''a point sprite only use one vertex. It could reduce a significant number of vertex for a thousand particles.''
*''there is no need to store or set map UV coordinates.it is done automatically.''
*''Point sprites always face camera. So we don't need to bother with angle and view.''

creating a point sprite shader is a very easy, we just need some implementation in pixelshader to define the texture coordinate

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float4 PixelShaderFunction(VertexShaderOutput input) : COLOR0
{
    float2 uv;
    uv = input.uv.xy; 
    return tex2D(Sampler, uv);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

and in a vertexshader we  only needs to return a POSITION0 for the vertex .

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float4 VertexShader(float4 pos : POSITION0) : POSITION0
{
    return mul(pos, WVPMatrix);
}&lt;/source&gt;

to enable the point sprite and set the properties of point sprite we do that in technique.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;technique Technique1
{
    pass Pass1
    {
   	sampler[0]	  = (Sampler);
	PointSpriteEnable = true;		
	PointSize    	  = 16.0f;			
	AlphaBlendEnable  = true;		
	SrcBlend	  = SrcAlpha;	
	DestBlend	  = One;		
	ZWriteEnable	  = false;	
			
        VertexShader = compile vs_1_1 VertexShaderFunction();
        PixelShader = compile ps_1_1 PixelShaderFunction();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

the complete point sprite shader

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;float4x4 World;
float4x4 View;
float4x4 Projection;
float4x4 WVPMatrix;

texture spriteTexture;
sampler Sampler = sampler_state 
{
	Texture   = &lt;spriteTexture&gt;;
	magfilter = LINEAR;					
	minfilter = LINEAR;				
	mipfilter = LINEAR;					
};

struct VertexShaderOutput
{
    float4 Position : POSITION0;
    float2 uv       :TEXCOORD0;
    
};

float4 VertexShaderFunction(float4 pos : POSITION0) : POSITION0
{
   return mul(pos, WVPMatrix);
}

float4 PixelShaderFunction(VertexShaderOutput input) : COLOR0
{
    float2 uv;
    uv = input.uv.xy; 
    return tex2D(Sampler, uv);
}

technique Technique1
{
    pass Pass1
    {
	sampler[0]	  = (Sampler);
	PointSpriteEnable = true;		
	PointSize    	  = 32.0f;			
	AlphaBlendEnable  = true;		
	SrcBlend	  = SrcAlpha;	
	DestBlend	  = One;		
	ZWriteEnable	  = false;	
			
        VertexShader = compile vs_1_1 VertexShaderFunction();
        PixelShader = compile ps_1_1 PixelShaderFunction();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

now lets move to our game1.cs  file. First we need  to declare and load the Effect and the texture. And to store the position vertex we use an array of VertexPositionColor elements. The position of vertex should be initialized with random number.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;Effect pointSpriteEffect;
        VertexPositionColor[] positionColor;
        VertexDeclaration vertexType;
        Texture2D textureSprite;
        Random rand;
        const int NUM = 50;
....

 protected override void LoadContent()
        {
            spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);
            textureSprite = Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt; 
                        (&quot;Images//texture_particle&quot;);
            pointSpriteEffect = Content.Load&lt;Effect&gt;
                        (&quot;Effect//PointSprite&quot;);
            pointSpriteEffect.Parameters
                        [&quot;spriteTexture&quot;].SetValue(textureSprite);
            positionColor = new VertexPositionColor[NUM];
            vertexType = new VertexDeclaration(graphics.GraphicsDevice,
            VertexPositionColor.VertexElements);
            rand = new Random();

            for (int i = 0; i &lt; NUM; i++) {

                positionColor[i].Position = 
                   new Vector3(rand.Next(400) / 10f,
                   rand.Next(400) / 10f, rand.Next(400) / 10f);
                positionColor[i].Color = Color.BlueViolet;
            }

}
&lt;/source&gt;

next step we create  DrawPointsprite method to draw the particle.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;public void DrawPointsprite() {

            Matrix world = Matrix.Identity;
      
            pointSpriteEffect.Parameters
                 [&quot;WVPMatrix&quot;].SetValue(world*view*projection);


            graphics.GraphicsDevice.VertexDeclaration = vertexType;
            pointSpriteEffect.Begin();
            foreach (EffectPass pass in
                pointSpriteEffect.CurrentTechnique.Passes)
            {
                pass.Begin();
                graphics.GraphicsDevice.DrawUserPrimitives
                    &lt;VertexPositionColor&gt;(
                        PrimitiveType.PointList,
                        positionColor,
                        0,
                        positionColor.Length);
                pass.End();
            }
            pointSpriteEffect.End();
        }
&lt;/source&gt;

and we call the DrawPointSprite() methode in Draw() methode
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;  protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)
        {
            GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.Black);
            DrawPointsprite();
            base.Draw(gameTime);
        }
&lt;/source&gt;
to make the position dynamic we make some implementation in Update() methode.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)
        {
            positionColor[rand.Next(0, NUM)].Position =
                new Vector3(rand.Next(400) / 10f,
                   rand.Next(400) / 10f, rand.Next(400) / 10f);
            positionColor[rand.Next(0, NUM)].Color = Color.White;

            base.Update(gameTime);
        }
&lt;/source&gt;
this is very simple pointsprite shader. You can make more sophiscated point sprite with dynamic size and color.

        }
        protected override void LoadContent()
        {
            spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);

            textureSprite =

      <text xml:space="preserve">Games always provided an environment for developing artificial intelligence. So in the last decades it became one of the most important components of games. Nowadays games that have sophisticated AI are state of the art.
Some simpler and some more sophisticated algorithms you will need in many games. 
It is used in many situations, some are:
* control of NPCs
* pathfinding
* dynamic game difficulty balancing
* combats / fights

== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;History&lt;/span&gt; == 

Already in the very beginning of game development, in the 1970s, programmers and developers came face to face with the field of game artificial intelligence. But at this time AI was simple and so to say humble and that status didn’t change until few years ago.
 
:&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;&quot;AI has been quietly transformed from the redheaded stepchild of gaming to the shining star of the industry&quot;&lt;/span&gt; - ''Steve Rabin, AI Game Programming WISDOM, 2002, p. 3''

The first games featuring a single player mode and therefore AI in its very beginning like the Atari game “Qwak!” didn’t have AI like we would describe it today. Enemy movement was mostly predefined and stored as patterns.
Only with the improvement of the hardware like the incorporation of microprocessors, that allowed way more computation, further random elements could be implemented. Games resulting from that were for example Space Invaders, Galaxian, and Pac-Man. Those games presented e.g. an increasing difficulty level, complex and varied enemy movements, events depending on the players input and even different personalities for each enemy. 
Along with the loom of new game genres in the 1990s new AI tools were developed and used. Among these tools were for example finite state machines. 
In the newer games AI became the main aspect of game. 
The improvement of AI didn’t only depend on the given hardware components. Well, in fact it definitely was a very important aspect. There were some problems that couldn’t be solved without significant processor resources. But it should be added that in the beginning of game development programmers simply didn’t take AI overly serious. Mostly AI was done in the very end after completing all the high-priority tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author = Steve Rabin |title = AI Game Programming Wisdom |year = 2002 |publisher = Cengage Learning }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
:&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Today AI climbed up the games ladder to be the highest-priority task.&lt;/span&gt;

== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Techniques&lt;/span&gt; ==
There are countless in-game scenarios crying for artificial Intelligence. So how do you solve chasing, flocking or path finding? Smart programmers and developers puzzled out some clever techniques and algorithm giving your games a touch of brain. Some interesting algorithms and AI situations I will explain in the following. I won't assert a claim to a complete list. But I will present you the basic scenarios you will be faced with. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author = David M. Bourg, Glenn Seemann |title = AI for Game Developers |year = 2004 |publisher = O'Reilly Media }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Chasing and Evading&lt;/span&gt; ===
No matter what kind of game you have chances are that you will be faced with chasing and evading.

==== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Basic Algorithm&lt;/span&gt; ====
The simplest way to describe chasing and evading in form of an algorithm is to firstly find out the distance between predator and prey and than in case of chase decrement it and in case of evade increment it. 

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Chase&lt;/span&gt; || &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Evade&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| &lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
if (predatorPos &gt; preyPos)
  predatorPos --;
else if (predatorPos &lt; preyPos)
  predatorPos ++;
&lt;/source&gt; 
|| 
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
if (preyPos&gt; predatorPos )
  preyPos++;
else if (preyX &lt; predatorPos )
  preyPos-- ?  &gt; ;
&lt;/source&gt; 
|}

Well it works but clearly that is not a very natural approach.

==== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Line-of-Sight Chasing&lt;/span&gt; ====
Way more realistic is to let the predator take a straight line towards the prey. 
[[File:Simple vs line of sight.jpg||none|thumb|simple chasing vs. line of sight chasing|right|400px]]
The algorithm for finding the direct way is a little more complicated. 
You need to find the direct and shortest way without unnecessary steps between predator and prey. Out there are a lot of useful algorithms that could help us out with our problem. Think about those line drawing algorithms build for a pixel environment. Those algorithms are built for finding a direct way from a starting point to a destination. But another criterion our algorithm has to fulfill is to find the shortest way.  So it is time to ask Bresenham. Bresenham’s algorithm offers us what we want. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham's_line_algorithm Here] you are.

==== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Intercepting&lt;/span&gt; ====
Even more effective for the predator could it be for it to intercept the prey at some point along the prey’s trajectory. 
[[File:Intercepting point.jpg|thumb|none|200px|intercepting]]
The intercepting point should be selected depending on the relative positions and velocities of predator and prey. To predict that point you have to consider three values. Those are position, direction and velocity. 

===== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Calculation steps&lt;/span&gt; =====
# Relative velocity (closing velocity)
#: &lt;math&gt;v = vPrey - vPredator&lt;/math&gt;
# Relative distance (range to close)
#: &lt;math&gt;d = posPrey - posPredator&lt;/math&gt;
# Time it will take to travel the relative distance at a speed equal to the closing speed (time to close)
#: &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{ \left| d \right| } { \left| v \right| }&lt;/math&gt;
# Predicted position of the prey (target point)
#: &lt;math&gt;pos = posPrey + (vPrey * t)&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
Vector FindInterceptingPoint(void)
{
  Vector v, d;
  Double t; 
  v = Prey.v - Predator.v; // closing velocity
  d = Prey.pos - Predator.pos; // range to close
  t = d.Magnitude() / v.Magnitude(); // time to close
  return Prey.pos + (Prey.v * t); // target point
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

=== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Pattern Movement&lt;/span&gt; ===
Patterns for different movements and maneuvers are predefined. Computer controlled character using those complex patterns give the illusion of intelligent behavior. The standard algorithm uses lists or arrays of encoded instructions. These instructions tell computer controlled character how to move each step through the game loop.

==== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/span&gt; ====
Following pattern was borrowed from the book &quot;AI for Game Developers&quot; from O'REILLY:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
Pattern[0].turnRight = 0;
Pattern[0].turnLeft = 0;
Pattern[0].stepForward = 2;
Pattern[0].stepBackward = 0;
Pattern[1].turnRight = 0;
Pattern[1].turnLeft = 0;
Pattern[1].stepForward = 2;
Pattern[1].stepBackward = 0;
Pattern[2].turnRight = 10;
Pattern[2].turnLeft = 0;
Pattern[2].stepForward = 0;
Pattern[2].stepBackward = 0;
Pattern[3].turnRight = 10;
Pattern[3].turnLeft = 0;
Pattern[3].stepForward = 0;
Pattern[3].stepBackward = 0;
Pattern[4].turnRight = 0;
Pattern[4].turnLeft = 0;
Pattern[4].stepForward = 2;
Pattern[4].stepBackward = 0;
Pattern[5].turnRight = 0;
Pattern[5].turnLeft = 0;
Pattern[5].stepForward = 2;
Pattern[5].stepBackward = 0;
Pattern[6].turnRight = 0;
Pattern[6].turnLeft = 10;
Pattern[6].stepForward = 0;
Pattern[6].stepBackward = 0;
.
.
.
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

The instruction encoded ins this pattern are:
# move forward 2 distance units
# move forward 2 distance units
# turn right 10 degrees
# turn right 10 degrees
# move forward 2 distance units
# move forward 2 distance units
# turn left 10 degrees
&lt;br /&gt;

=== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Flocking&lt;/span&gt; ===

Sometimes in games it’s more realistic to let non player characters move in cohesive groups. Let’s consider birds, sheep and all these gregarious animals always hiding in the safety of their flock. Or what about those big computer controlled human, troll or orcs units. Flocking definitely is a common performance in games. 
See the clip side that I borrowed from roxlu here http://vimeo.com/5352863.: 

==== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Basic Algorithm&lt;/span&gt; ====
There are some basic flocking algorithms implementing our wished behavior. We will look at the Craig Reynolds algorithm. This implementation is leaderless. All individuals of the boid (term coined by Craig Reynolds referring to simulated flocks) are following the group itself. 

===== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Rules&lt;/span&gt; =====
The algorithm is following three simple rules:

* Separation
*: steer to avoid hitting the neighbors
* Alignment
*: steer so as to align itself to the average heading of the neighbors
* Cohesion
*: steer toward the average position of the neighbors

===== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/span&gt; =====
You can find an explanation of the algorithm and its implmentation here: 
http://oreilly.com/catalog/ai/chapter/ch04.pdf

=== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Path finding&lt;/span&gt; ===
There are thousands of individual path finding problems. You won’t find one algorithm as sure formula for all kind of them. Even the A* algorithm – actually an ideal solutions for many problems – is not the appropriate for every situation. 

==== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Basic algorithm&lt;/span&gt; ====
The algorithms in chapter Chase and Evading do some basic path finding. We clarified that the Line-of-Sight algorithm creates a way more realistic movement. Now let’s have a look at obstacle avoidance: 

===== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Obstacle Avoidance&lt;/span&gt; =====
The easiest way to implement obstacle avoidance is the following: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
if Player In Line of Sight
{
  Follow Straight Path to Player
}
else
{
  Move in Random Direction
}
&lt;/source&gt; 

Problem here is due to its simplicity this will only work with a few obstacles. A little more effective is it to let the character trace around an obstacle: 
When the character borders on an obstacle it traces around it. It stops tracing once the destination is in the characters line of sight.

===== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Breadcrumb Path finding&lt;/span&gt; =====
Here the player itself is defining the way for the non player character. This way the computer controlled player seems very intelligent. The player is leaving markers on the road every step it takes. The non player character will only follow those footsteps. 

===== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Path Following&lt;/span&gt; =====
Path following you will need for example in a car racing game. There is no definite destination to head to. There is only a predefined road that has to be followed. 

===== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Way Point Navigation&lt;/span&gt; =====
Path finding is a very time consuming task. Especially when you have a big environment with a lot of obstacles. Waypoint reduces this problem. The main idea is it to place nodes in the game environment and then use them for inexpensive path finding algorithms.

===== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;A* Path finding&lt;/span&gt; =====
The A* algorithm provides an effective solution to the problem of path finding.

=== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Further Techniques&lt;/span&gt; ===
We looked at a lot of gameplay situations needing an AI approach. But those aren't nearly all. If your curiosity just have a look at O'REILLY's book &quot;AI for Game Developers&quot;

== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Examples&lt;/span&gt; ==
=== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Pong&lt;/span&gt; ===
Pong was firstly released in 1972 by Atari. It consists of a black screen with 2 paddles, one on each side of the screen, and a ball. The paddles are controlled by players who can move them up and down to fetch the ball which is moving from side to side. If one of the players misses the ball, the opponent is credited with one point. The game ends if one players reaches a fixed number of points - e.g. 10 points.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pong&lt;/ref&gt;

=== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;AI in Pong&lt;/span&gt; ===
If you decide to play against the computer you are actually playing against an AI algorithm. 
You are always standing before the decision if you move your paddle up, down or not at all. And so is the computer: 

==== 1st approach ====
An easy solution for this problem is to analyze the current state of the ball (its position and its direction of movement) to decide which move to make with the paddle. By knowing the direction of the ball (an angle in degree) you can determine whether the ball wents up or down on the screen. The computer can now calculate the difference in the y-positions of ball and paddle and decide upon that knowledge to move the paddle down or up to decrease this difference until it is 0 in the best case. If it is nearly 0 then the paddle can stop and wait till the ball movement requires other actions to be taken.

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
int difference = ball.positionY – paddle.positionY;

if(difference &gt;= 5 || difference &lt;= -5)
{
	if(difference &gt; 0)
	{
		paddle.moveDown();
	}
	else
	{
		paddle.moveUp();
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The benefit of this approach is that it is easy to implement. It does not need much calculation effort (good performance) and tends to do some mistakes or gets taken by surprise in some situations. There it seems more human-like and is beatable. One of these mean (for the computer AI) situations is when the paddle follows the ball up and then shortly before the ball reaches the side of the paddle it hits the upper wall and changes its direction to go down. Then it may occur that the paddle is too slow (especially with faster balls in higher levels) to react on this change in direction and loses the ball.

==== 2nd approach ====
The 2nd approach is a little more sophisticated and needs more calculation. All you need is the current position of the ball and its current movement direction - that's what you can get from the game engine. Based on these values it is possible to determine the further way of the ball (including all wall collisions and direction changes) and at the end the position where it could possibly hit the paddle of the AI player. If you got this point - and this point will never change because normal pong has no suddenly occuring situations that could change the direction somehow - you just have to directly move the paddle to this point to catch the ball and kick it back in the opponents half. This approach could also be slightly modified by positioning the paddle in a way it hits the ball at the corners of the paddle to give it a little swerve.

Even if it's the more improved solution to this problem there are some disadvantages. It is more complicated to implement this algorithm, it may need longer and costs more resources to calculate the end position of the ball (maybe too long for slow systems like mobile phones, handhelds, etc.) and the most important point (in my opinion) is that you have a de facto unbeatable and perfect enemy because it always hits the ball as good as it's possible which could be annoying for a real player to compete with.


=== More Examples ===
* eliza
* tic tac toe

== &lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;Difficulties&lt;/span&gt; ==
AI has to be calculated live (during the game), therefore (good) performance is very important to let the game run smoothly. To ensure that there are many simplifications, workarounds, cheats in the algorithms which approximate the ideal behaviour of the player. So they are fast and intelligent at the same time. When performance is an important issue, it is clear that stuff like bruteforcing all possible decisions is not the best way to deal with such situations in game AI.

Another essential fact is that the computer player should not play perfect even if he could. Cheating is a big word in that topic, because the computer knows all facts and has all kinds of information about the game world so it would be possible to let the AI player know things they realistically could not know. The player has to think he plays against a real enemy and not a computer, that is why firstly the AI has to be beatable (not invincible) and furthermore it has to act human-like (do mistakes, act randomly in some situations, etc.). If the AI does not behave in this way the game would be soon very boring for the player or just frustrating if he has no chance to win. Some games use approximation algorithms instead of perfect solutions and implement &quot;wrong&quot; (or worse) decisions in their algorithms.

:&lt;span style=&quot;color:#006400&quot;&gt;half-dozen rules of thumb and heuristics, just enough to give a good gameplay experience&lt;/span&gt;

== Input Devices ==

=== Introduction ===
Input Devices is one of the most important chapters in a handbook for game creation. A computer (or Xbox) game subsists on interaction with the user - that is why there needs be to a method to check the user input and to let game react on this input.

XNA makes it very easy to control the user devices. It offers an easy-to-use and understandable API for access to mouse, keyboard and gamepad. Using this it is possible to write an user-interaction scheme in a short time. Basically XNA offers easy access to:

* Mouse
* Keyboard
* Gamepad

The basic concept is the same for all controller types. XNA provides a set of static classes (one for each type) which can be used to retrieve the status and all properties (e.g. pressed buttons, movements, ...) of the input device.

This detection is usually located in the Update()-method of the game loop to retrieve the status as often as possible. Storing the states of all input devices in class variables allow it to check the status in other methods and classes. It is a common solution to have an array of boolean variables in the class which represent the status of all controllers - namely the pressed buttons on the controller, the mouse movements and clicks and the pressed keys on the keyboard.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
protected override void Update(GameTime gameTime)
{
    KeyboardState kbState = Keyboard.GetState();
    // ...
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Windows vs. Xbox ===
Windows and Xbox games are usually played in a different way. In general a Windows computer is controlled by a mouse and a keyboard, whereas an Xbox is often controlled by a gamepad. Therefore it needs a control structure to decide whether the code is executed on Windows or Xbox to set a default controller for the game.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
#if XBOX
// this code is embedded only in xbox project
#endif
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

But it is also possible to connect a mouse or keyboard to an Xbox as well as to connect an Xbox controller to a Windows computer. So in most of the cases it is better to check for example if a gamepad is connected. Another way of dealing with that problem is to store the user's controller of choice in a variable. So the user may decide which controller he likes to use to play your game.

=== Mouse ===
[[File:Wireless mouse.jpg|thumb|Wireless Mouse]]

At first you have to get an instance of the mouse state by calling the static GetState()-method of the Mouse class. This object now gives you access to a lot of public attributes from the connected mouse.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
MouseState mouse = Mouse.GetState();
bool leftButton = (mouse.LeftButton == ButtonState.Pressed); // left mouse button
bool middleButton = (mouse.MiddleButton == ButtonState.Pressed); // middle mouse button
bool rightButton = (mouse.RightButton == ButtonState.Pressed); // right mouse button
int x = mouse.X; // horizontal mouse position
int y = mouse.Y; // vertical mouse position
int scroll = mouse.ScrollWheelValue; // scroll wheel value
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The state of the mouse buttons is read through the attribute &quot;xxxButton&quot; (where xxx stands for the type - left, middle, right). If you compare this value with ButtonState.Pressed or ButtonState.Released you can retrieve the state of this button. In the example above it stores the state of each button in a boolean variable that is true if the associated button is pressed.

The mouse position on the screen is stored in the X and Y attribute of the mouse object. This value is always positive (as it starts with 0,0 in left upper corner) and may be compared to further mouse positions (in a game logic) to detect a specific movement of the mouse. A simple example would be:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
MouseState mouse = Mouse.GetState();
int x = mouse.X;
int y = mouse.Y;
deltaX = oldX - x; // difference of horizontal positions
deltaY = oldY - y; // difference of vertical positions
oldX = x;
oldY = y;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Most of the modern mouse also have a scroll wheel that is often used in games, for example to zoom, to scroll or to switch between different weapons. The attribute ScrollWheelValue is an integer that represents the scroll state of the mouse.

To recognize the movement of the scroll wheel it is necessary to store some older values and compare them with each other. The sign of this difference indicates the scroll direction and the absolute value indicates the speed of scroll movement.

=== Keyboard ===
[[File:Keyboard de kyr R7309238 wp.jpg|thumb|Cherry Keyboard]]

To check the state of the keys on a keyboard is very simple. At first you have to get an KeyboardState object by calling the static method GetState from the Keyboard class. This instance now lets you retrieve the state of specific keys.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
KeyboardState keyboard = Keyboard.GetState();
bool keyB = keyboard.IsKeyDown(Keys.B); // key &quot;B&quot; on keyboard
bool keyArrowLeft = keyboard.IsKeyDown(Keys.Left); // arrow left on keyboard
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The boolean variables keyB and keyArrowLeft now store &quot;true&quot; if the specific key is pressed right now or &quot;false&quot; if it is not pressed. This method can be repeated for each key that is of interest for the application or game.

It is also possible to directly get an array of all keys of the keyboard that are currently pressed. A call of the method GetPressedKeys returns an array of Keys that can be traversed key by key.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
KeyboardState keyboard = Keyboard.GetState();
Keys[] keys = keyboard.GetPressedKeys(); // array of keys
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Gamepad ===
The gamepad is the most convenient way to play a game on the Xbox. Despite XNA is designed to develop games for Windows as well as for Xbox, the default API only supports the original Xbox controller. Based on that fact you have to decide whether you want to force your user to use (and maybe buy) the Xbox gamepad or if you want to support any other gamepads for example from Logitech.

That might be more comfortable for the user, though it means more coding effort for the developer. In this chapter I want to describe the implementation for both the Xbox controller and all other controllers.

==== Xbox Gamepad ====
[[File:Xbox-360-Wireless-Controller-White.jpg|thumb|Xbox 360 Wireless Controller]]

Accessing this input device is nearly as easy as checking the state of mouse or keyboard. One (and important) difference is that XNA makes it able to connect up to four different gamepads to the Xbox or Windows computer.

So it is (often) necessary to implement a loop over all gamepads that are connected to check their states individually. How this (and more) can be done is explained in the following paragraphs.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
GamePadState[] gamePad = new GamePadState[4];
for(int i = 0; i &lt; 4; i++) { // loop over up to 4 gamepads
    gamePad[i] = GamePad.GetState(i); // get state of gamepad
    if(gamePad[i].IsConnected) {
        // gamepad is connected
    }
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

In this loop you can access all attributes like the buttons (front and shoulder), the digital pad and the two analog sticks. Here is how you do it:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
bool aButton = (gamePad[0].Buttons.A == ButtonState.Pressed); // button A
bool leftDigital = (gamePad[0].DPad.Right == ButtonState.Pressed); // left button on digital pad
int leftStick = gamePad[0].ThumbSticks.Left.X; // horizontal position of left stick
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The rumble effect lets the gamepad vibrate and gives the player a special feedback to his actions in the game. For instance a hit by an opponent in a shooter game or a crash in a racing game could cause such feedback. The second and third parameter control the intensity of the rumbling effect.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
GamePad.SetVibration(int controllerNr, float leftRumble, float rightRumble); // make the controller rumble
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

==== Other Gamepads ====
[[File:Sidewinder gamepad.jpg|thumb|Microsoft Sidewinder Gamepad]]

Other gamepads than the original Xbox controller are not supported by XNA. But it is possible to integrate a support for them with a free library which is called [http://slimdx.mdxinfo.com/ SlimDX].

In addition you need a helper class that can be found [http://slimdx.xnamag.de/article.php?id=25 here] - it uses SlimDX to check the gamepad state of controllers that are not the original Xbox controller.

If you have downloaded, installed and integrated both the SlimDX library and the helper class you can use the following code to check the gamepad states - like you have done with the Xbox controller in XNA.

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
controller = new GameController(this, 0); // number of gamepad
GameControllerState state = controller.GetState();
bool button1 = state.GetButtons()[1]; // button 1 pressed
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== Kinect ===
[[File:Xbox-360-Kinect-Standalone.png|thumb|Xbox 360 Kinect Standalone]]

Kinect is a revolutionary video camera for the Xbox that recognizes your movement in front of the television. This can be used to control games just with your body. Developers can use the Kinect framework to integrate this into their game.

== Use Kinect to create Models ==
Starting with XNA 5.0 (maybe) also the rest of us maybe able to use the Kinect as an input device for our games. Meanwhile, there are many hacks showing how to use the Kinect to scan objects.  This is a great way to create realistic models for new kinds of games.  Imagine scanning yourself and your friend with the Kinect and use those models in your next boxing game.  Or scan your living room and have all your personal furniture show up as interiors in your next game.

== Finding free Sounds ==
There are many sources of free sounds on the net.  This chapter will show you where you can find which sounds and music, and which licences are the right licences for you.  Important is also the help you may need as with respect to what kind of mood do you want to create.  Or if you want to create some random sound or use musac (music that sucks).

Here are a few good sites with many audio samples:

http://www.freesound.org/searchText.php
This site is good because, you can just search a keyword and listen free to any song.

Creating a sound is easy and almost anything we do creates sound.  In musical contexts sound is created by acoustic or electric instruments or analog or digital hardware. To use sounds in a game they must first be recorded and [[w:digitized|digitized]], either in the recording process itself or afterwards.  It is increasingly difficult to find places on earth that are absent of man made sound, so it is easy to understand that games trying to imitate reality ''should'' have sound in almost every sequence, even if only in the background.  Filmmakers record background noise repeatedly over the course of a shoot to increase the authenticity of a film.  There are several basic steps in capturing sound: recording, manipulation/ effecting and playing/ reproduction.  
XNA Game Studio 4 added classes for handling MP3s and capturing and playing back sound from a headset, so even a user's voice can be processed in the same way as a normal recording.
=== Recording ===
In general, sound is recorded in analog or digital form.  Because of its low start up cost and easy, precise editing, digital recording is the more popular form of recording.
[[File:StudioSmall.jpg|thumb|A typical computer based recording studio setup]]
'''Digital audio recording''' is the act of recording a sound by taking [[w:Sample_%28signal%29|discrete samples]] of its wave form and turning them into digital information that can be stored or processed.  Digital recording is typically done on a computer, but can also be done with a stand alone recorder with a hard drive, or a handheld device with flash memory.  [[File:HandHeldRecorder.JPG|thumb|A hand held digital  recorder]]The '''sampling rate''' is measured in Hertz, and is the number of times a second a sound is sampled. The '''[[w:Audio_bit_depth|bit depth]]''' , measured in bits, is ''how much'' information is sampled, each time a sample is taken. Higher bit depths offer a more accurate approximation of a wave form.  A &quot;CD quality&quot; audio recording is 16 bits, at a 44.1 kHz sampling rate.  Generally, the highest quality digital recordings are 24 bit at 192khz.  Historically, due to space limitations, games were limited to [[w:8-bit_%28music%29|8 bit]] recordings.  These &quot;classic&quot; game sound effects and music are easily distinguished from their more modern counterparts.  It is comparatively easy to record digitally, for several reasons.  Digital recording, in its most basic form, requires only a computer.  With the use of [[w:Plugins|plugins]], a computer can generate most of the sound a user might need.  More elaborate setups might include an audio interface, for recording live instruments or midi signals.  Live (microphone or instrument input) and computer generated sound can be seamlessly mixed in audio software.  Editing is nonlinear and is also simple.  [[File:MetalZone001.ogg|thumb|a mixture of slide guitar, bass guitar and software plugins]]A user can cut, copy and paste pieces of a recording and arrange them as desired.  These functions can also be performed across projects and platforms.  
'''Compression'''
Until recently, MP3 was by far the most popular form compressing an audio file.  MP3s are satisfactory for a game if they are primary compressions (i.e. the first time a full quality audio file has been compressed) above a 160 kbps [[w:Bit_rate|bit rate]].  Any bit rate below that begins to sound &quot;lossy.&quot; As of version 4, XNA Game Studio has WAV and MP3 importer classes, meaning a game's sound quality is basically up to the creator.

'''Analog audio recording''' is the act of recording a sound wave in its entirety, as an electronic signal, typically onto magnetic tape.  Before an analog recording can be put on CD or used in a game, it must be digitized.  The signal can be recorded with less noise if this conversion is done during recording rather than as a separate step.  This form of recording is typically ruled out by modern musicians, due to the expense and the time it requires. The need for an engineer, mixing board, tape machine, tape reels and sound room, contribute to the cost.  Editing is more laborious because it is linear.  That is, an engineer cannot simply copy one good part of a recording to multiple parts of a song.  Editing means physically cutting the tape, or rerecording part by part.
[[File:MicTLM103.jpg|thumb|A condenser microphone]]
'''Microphones''' use a similar principle the the human eardrum to receive sound.  Inside a microphone, a membrane or set of ribbons is displaced by a sound wave and triggers an electrical signal, also a wave form.  That is, a microphone translates the sound wave (most often vibrating air) into an electrical wave form, using magnets to generate the electrical signal.  There are two general kinds of microphone.  Dynamic microphones, which are passive, needing no external power to send electrical signals.  Condenser microphones need an external power source called phantom power to function. This is commonly 48 volts and is sent to the microphone through its cable from a mixer or microphone amplifier.

'''[[w:MIDI|MIDI]]''' allows separate external synthesizers and other audio equipment to communicate with each other and was an essential part of any studio until USB began replacing its hardware in the early 2000's.

'''Acoustic instruments''' are the predecessors to electric instruments and need no [[w:Amplifier|amplification]] to be heard.  They are recorded by using a microphone to pick up their sound.

'''Electric instruments''' (e.g. guitars and bass guitars) use the vibration of strings over magnetic coils to generate an electrical signal.  To be heard, these signals must be amplified and sent through loudspeakers, which vibrate the air.  When struck without amplification, the strings also make sound waves but they are not strong enough to be heard more than a few meters away from the instrument being played.  The [[w:Overtones|overtones]] and harmonics created by stringed instruments, especially by a piano, are extremely difficult to emulate using digital technology.  
[[File:MotuDAC.jpg|thumb|A rack mountable audio interface]]
An '''audio interface''' (AI), or '''[[w:Sound_card|sound card]]''', converts the analog signals it receives into digital information a computer can process.  These analog signals are usually generated by microphones, electric instruments or synthesizers.  Computers can generate digital sound signals and do not need to be sent through an AI in order to be processed.  In order for the signals being processed by the computer (analog or digital) to be heard, they need to be sent back out through an AI that converts the digital signals back into analog signals and then through loudspeakers or headphones.

'''Recording software''' or [[w:Music_sequencer|sequencer]] processes the signals that are generated by a computer or converted using an AI and can produce signals using plugins.  These plugins can also emulate analog effects or instruments.  The sound options available to a game creator, have increased with recording software performance.  Historically, creators were limited to very small sound file size.  Modern game stations have more processing power and random access memory and can handle much larger, higher quality sound files.  It is commonplace for bands to license songs to video game makers for game soundtracks.

Traditionally, '''[[w:Sound_effects|sound effects]]''' were recorded in much the same way as music; in a studio with someone performing the sound (e.g. breaking glass or footsteps) in front a microphone.  In recent years, with the availability of innumerable sound sample libraries, game makers, like filmmakers, use mostly  prerecorded samples for sound effects.  Sound effects are extremely important to a players experience of a game, especially in realistic games where sounds are required to be as authentic as possible.

=== Reproduction ===

Sound reproduction uses much the same process as recording, but in reverse.  A tape or record is played or digital file read and converted back into sound waves.  This is usually done with speakers or headphones.  Accurate sound reproduction is vital to the experience of a game.
[[File:HeadphoneTypes.jpg|thumb|around-ear and in-ear headphones]]
'''Speakers''' and '''headphones''' are the rough equivalent of microphones but are used for sound output, instead of sound input.  The electrical signals being played back are sent through an [[w:Amplifier|amplifier]], which strengthens the signal, through a cable to speakers, where a magnet is used to set the speaker's membrane in motion.  This membrane vibrates the air, sending sound waves into the space in in front of and behind the membrane.  Speakers are usually contained in some sort of housing, which needs to be tuned for accurate sound reproduction.  Housings for headphone speakers come in three general types: over-ear, around-ear, and in-ear.  These types have two configurations.  They can be open, which projects sound outward, as well as into the ear, or closed which blocks outside noise and keeps sound from escaping.
[[File:SpeakerAdamANF.jpg|thumb|A typical &quot;nearfield&quot; studio monitor]]

=== Audio Effects ===
Audio effects are used to change existing sounds which are recorded or generated by software or by synthesizers and are usually user configurable.  Traditionally they were encased in boxes, or [[w:Effects_pedal|pedals]], that could be activated with the foot of a musician during a musical performance or in larger [[w:19-inch_rack|rack mountable]] formats for use in a recording studio.  Software plugins are able to emulate most formerly hardware based effects. 
[[File:PedalMetalZone.jpg|thumb|A distortion pedal]]
*'''Filter'''
The filter is a commonly used effect. Its function is to cut off frequencies above or below a defined frequency, known as the cutoff. The resulting frequency can be amplified and is known as resonance. 
There a different types of filters and there are many different approaches to build these with many individual characteristics. We only differ between their cutoff types:
#'''Lowpass filter'''
Allow lower frequencies through to the output stage, cutting higher frequencies.
#'''Highpass filter'''
Allow higher frequencies through to the output stage, cutting lower frequencies.
#'''Bandpass filter'''
#'''Notch filter'''

*'''Equalizer'''
Boosts or cuts certain frequency bands in a signal.
*'''Delay'''
Repeats an incoming signal to the output stage making the output sound like and [[w:Echo_%28phenomenon%29|echo]] of the original input.
*'''Reverb'''

*'''Flanger'''
*'''Phaser'''
*'''Chorus'''
*'''Unisono'''
*'''Distortion'''
Manipulates or deforms an incoming signal.
*'''Waveshaping'''

=== Synthesizer ===
Synthesizers use electronic circuits to generate electric signals.  They can be analog, digital or a combination of both.

*'''Subtractive synthesis'''
Most analog and digital synthesizers use this common approach of subtractive synthesis. The essence of these synthesizers are one ore more oscillators with a rich filled frequency spectrum of overtones. These sounds can be filtered by low-pass, band-pass, high-pass or notch filter.

*'''Additive synthesis'''
Instead of filtering overtones like the subtractive synthesis does, we are adding overtones to the base note.

*'''FM synthesis''' 
Also called frequency modulation synthesis is an approach which has its origin in telecommunications engineering. The main idea is to create overtones by manipulating a carrier wave's frequency by an other modulating wave. So the carrier wave's frequency gets higher, where the modulation wave's position is positive and gets lower, where the modulation wave'postion is negative.

*'''PM synthesis'''
Phase modulation synthesis is very similar in its acoustic results to frequency modulation. Instead of manipulating the frequency of the carrier wave, its phase gets manipulated by a modulation wave.

*'''Wavetable synthesis'''
A wavetable is mostly a bunch of samples and an oscillator picks a small window of these samples and repeats this part of information. This window can be moved while it's playing.

*'''Granular synthesis'''
The granular synthesis is also based on an existing sample wave file like the wavetable synthesis, but this wave sample is cut it many small pieces also called grains which are between 1 and 50 milliseconds.

=== Mood in games (with examples)===

*'''Action game'''
:In action games there are only sounds with a simple background music. These has a catchy melody. That means that you have to avoid big score leaps and that the backgroundmusic has to be singable. To get an exciting mood you have to take fast tempo and take . The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_%28music%29 key] has to be in major. So that the melody sounds happy. 
:In addition there has to be a soundnotification, when you get a point or removed a line and so on.
 
;'''E.g. Tetris'''
:The melody of the backgroundmusic is very catchy simple and singable. There are no big score leaps. 
#'''Soundsnotification''':
::-Removing a line: 
::Here could be a space sound. Something like that http://www.flashkit.com/soundfx/Electronic/Other/Spacely_-Daniel_D-8815/index.php

::-turning a shape
::Here could be a short sound. This sound could be a little tick.

== Texture ==
Textures come in many formats, some well known such as bmp, gif, jpg or png, some less known like dds, dib oder hdr formats.  You need to know about UV coordinates and how they get mapped.  Also topics such as texture tiling, transparent textures, and textures are accessed and used in the shader should be discussed.

=== Introduction===

In the context of 3D modeling a texture map is a bitmap that is applied to a models surface. In combination with shaders it is possible to display nearly every possible face and attribute of nearly any material.
The process of texturing is comparable to applying patterned paper to a box.
Multitexturing is the use of more than one texture at a time on one model.

{{BookCat}}

==Texture Coordinates/ UVW Coordinates==

Every vertex has got a xyz-position and  additionally a texture coordinate in the uvw-space (also called uvw-coordinate).&lt;br /&gt;
The uvw-coordinates are used to how to project a texture to a polygon. In case of a 2d- bitmaptexture like they are normally used in computer games there are just the u and v coordinates needed.

In case of mathematical textures (3d noise e.g.) normally the uwv coordinates are needed.

*The uv coordinate (0,0) is the bitmaps left bottom corner
*The uv coordinate (1,1) is the bitmaps right top corner
*If uv coordinates &lt;0 or &gt;1: tiling of a texture

One Vertex could have more than one texturecoordinate: So there is more than one mapping channel used for displaying overlapping textures to represent more complicated structures.

===Tiling===
Tiling is the repetition and the arrangement of the repetition of a texture next to each other, free of overlaps.
If the uv coordinate is &lt;0, the texture will be scaled down and repeated.
If the uv coordinate is &gt;1, the texture will be scaled up.

===Games===
In games there is often just one texture for the whole 3d-model, so there is just one texturecoordinate for one vertex, therefore there is just one mapping channel.

==How to build textures in Photoshop==
===Why?===
Photoshop is in this context generally used for the creation and editing of textures for 3d-models.
Frequently photographs are used to convey a realistic impression. Example: Lizard's skin -&gt; Dragon texture.

===How?===
====Transparent Textures and Color Blending====
Color blending mixes two colors together to produce a third color.

The first color is called the source color which is the new color being added. The second color is called the destination color which is the color that already exists (in a render target, for example). Each color has a separate blend factor that determines how much of each color is combined into the final product. Once the source and destination colors have been multiplied by their blend factors, the results are combined according to the specified blend function. The normal blend function is simple addition.

====Seamless Textures====
Mostly textures have to be tile able. Therefore no edges should be visible if the image is repeated.&lt;br/&gt;
A great, very useful helper is the Photshop filter-&gt;sonstige Filter-&gt; Verschiebungseffekt.&lt;br/&gt;
It is very useful to create edge free patterns.
=====example how to create seamless textures (in Photoshop CS 4)=====


[[File:Tiling1.jpg|ohne|x200px|Example picture]]&lt;br/&gt;
[[File:Tiling2.jpg|ohne|x200px|Add caption here]]&lt;br/&gt;
1) Get the picture border in the middle. Use the Filter • Sonstige Filter • Verschiebungseffekt. The value should be the half length of the edge. ''Do not forget the option &quot;Durch verschobenen Teil ersetzen&quot;!!''
Now you have to retouch the resulting edges.


------------------------------------
'''Typical tools for retouching'''&lt;br/&gt;
Copy and Paste of certain bitmap sections and mask-using&lt;br/&gt;



Stamp and Brush&lt;br/&gt;





------------------------------------
[[File:Tiling3.jpg|ohne|x200px|Add caption here]]&lt;br/&gt;
2) You have to do this a second time, because there are edges at the sides of the picture.
Mark the mid-points of the sides and use the filter &quot;Verschiebungseffekt&quot; a second time. Move the picture by a third or a quarter of the edge length.&lt;br/&gt;
Now the marks and edges are somewhere in the pictures center. Here you have to do the last retouching.

[[File:Tiling4.jpg||ohne|x200px|Add caption here]]&lt;br/&gt;
[[File:Tiling5.jpg||ohne|x200px|Add caption here]]&lt;br/&gt;
Then it looks like this:&lt;br/&gt;

'''Height information/Bump maps&lt;br/&gt;'''
It is a little complicated to get height information from a picture, also not every photo is suitable to get its height-information and to get a bump map. 
Here you find a tutorial how to do it:

==Textures in XNA==
The following nice tutorial how to do it you can find here :
[http://www.riemers.net/eng/Tutorials/XNA/Csharp/Series2/Textures.php http://www.riemers.net/ Tutorials]

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;texture = Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt; (&quot;riemerstexture&quot;);&lt;/source&gt;
This line binds the asset we just loaded in our project to the texture variable!

Now we have to define 3 vertices and to store them in an array. We will need to be able to store a 3d Position and a texture coordinate. The vertex format is VertexPositionTexture.
We have to declare this variable at the top.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt; VertexPositionTexture[] vertices;&lt;/source&gt;

Now we define the 3 vertices of our triangle in our SetUpVertices method we create:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 private void SetUpVertices()
 {
     vertices = new VertexPositionTexture[3];
 
     vertices[0].Position = new Vector3(-10f, 10f, 0f);
     vertices[0].TextureCoordinate.X = 0;
     vertices[0].TextureCoordinate.Y = 0;
 
     vertices[1].Position = new Vector3(10f, -10f, 0f);
     vertices[1].TextureCoordinate.X = 1;
     vertices[1].TextureCoordinate.Y = 1;
 
     vertices[2].Position = new Vector3(-10f, -10f, 0f);
     vertices[2].TextureCoordinate.X = 0;
     vertices[2].TextureCoordinate.Y = 1;
 
      texturedVertexDeclaration = new VertexDeclaration(device, VertexPositionTexture.VertexElements);
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

For every vertex we define it is position in 3D space in a clockwise way.


Next we define which UV-Coordinate in our texture corresponds with the vertex. Remember: the (0,0)texture coordinate us at the top let point of our texture image, the (1,0) at the top right and the (1,1) at the bottom right.


Don’t forget to call the SetUpVertices method from your LoadContent method:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt; SetUpVertices ();&lt;/source&gt;

Now our vertice is set up and our texture image load, now we draw the triangle:&lt;br/&gt;
In the Draw method add this code after our call to the Clear method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 Matrix worldMatrix = Matrix.Identity;
 effect.CurrentTechnique = effect.Techniques[&quot;TexturedNoShading
 &quot;];
 effect.Parameters[&quot;xWorld&quot;].SetValue(worldMatrix);
 effect.Parameters[&quot;xView&quot;].SetValue(viewMatrix);
 effect.Parameters[&quot;xProjection&quot;].SetValue(projectionMatrix);
 effect.Parameters[&quot;xTexture&quot;].SetValue(texture);
 effect.Begin();
 foreach (EffectPass pass in effect.CurrentTechnique.Passes)
 {
     pass.Begin();
 
      device.VertexDeclaration = texturedVertexDeclaration;
     device.DrawUserPrimitives(PrimitiveType.TriangleList, vertices, 0, 1);
 
     pass.End();
 }
 effect.End();&lt;/source&gt;

We need to instruct our graphics card to sample the color of every pixel from the texture image. 
This is exactly what the TexturedNoShading technique of my effect file does, so we set it as active technique. As we didn’t specify any normals for our vectors, we cannot expect the effect to do any meaningful shading calculations.

As explained in Series 1, we need to set the World matrix to identity so the triangles will be rendered where we defined them, and View and Projection matrices so the graphics card can map the 3D positions to 2D screen coordinates.

Finally, we pass our texture to the technique. Then we actually draw our triangle from our vertices array, as done before in the first series.

Running this should already give you a textured triangle, displaying half of the texture image! To display the whole image, we simply have to expand our SetUpVertices method by adding the second triangle:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt; private void SetUpVertices()
 {
      vertices = new VertexPositionTexture[6];
 
      vertices[0].Position = new Vector3(-10f, 10f, 0f);
      vertices[0].TextureCoordinate.X = 0;
      vertices[0].TextureCoordinate.Y = 0;
 
      vertices[1].Position = new Vector3(10f, -10f, 0f);
      vertices[1].TextureCoordinate.X = 1;
      vertices[1].TextureCoordinate.Y = 1;
 
      vertices[2].Position = new Vector3(-10f, -10f, 0f);
      vertices[2].TextureCoordinate.X = 0;
      vertices[2].TextureCoordinate.Y = 1;
 
      vertices[3].Position = new Vector3(10.1f, -9.9f, 0f);
      vertices[3].TextureCoordinate.X = 1;
      vertices[3].TextureCoordinate.Y = 1;
 
      vertices[4].Position = new Vector3(-9.9f, 10.1f, 0f);
      vertices[4].TextureCoordinate.X = 0;
      vertices[4].TextureCoordinate.Y = 0;
 
      vertices[5].Position = new Vector3(10.1f, 10.1f, 0f);
      vertices[5].TextureCoordinate.X = 1;
      vertices[5].TextureCoordinate.Y = 0;
 }&lt;/source&gt;

We simply added another set of 3 vertices for a second triangle, to complete the texture image. Don’t forget to adjust your Draw method so you render 2 triangles instead of only 1:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt; device.DrawUserPrimitives(PrimitiveType.TriangleList, vertices, 0, 2, VertexPositionTexture.VertexDeclaration);&lt;/source&gt;

Now run this code, and you should see the whole texture image, displayed by 2 triangles!

= Finding free Models =
You don't have to create 3D models from scratch. Most objects you may need have already been created, you only need to find them.  For Sketchup and Blender, for instance, there are many available models.  So here we show you how to find 3D models, what to worry about, especially with respect to licencing.

== Finding free Textures and Graphics ==
Where do I find textures and graphics on the internet?  And how do I find the kind of graphics I need?  

Also, important to consider:
Under what licence are these graphics?  What are the constraints for my software, such that I can use them?  Where do I find 'for-sale' graphics, or where can I hire a designer to create custom graphics for my game?

== Heads-Up-Display ==
[[Image:HUD_view.jpg|right|thumb|Head Up Display (HUD) view from FA-18 Hornet.]]
A Heads-Up-Display (short HUD) is any transparent display that presents information without requiring users to look away from their usual viewpoints. The origin of the name stems from the modern aircraft pilots being able to view information with heads &quot;up&quot; and looking forward, instead of angled down looking at lower instruments.

Although they were initially developed for military aviation, HUDs are now used in commercial aircraft, automobiles, and even in todays game design. There the HUD relays information to the player as part of a game's user interface.

This article will feature examples for HUD elements and XNA templates for some of these basic components. Since good sprites are really important for creating a great looking HUD, designing these with professional image processing applications, such as Gimp or Photoshop is vital. Developing the skills will not be part of this article.

=== Introduction ===
==== Application ====
There are many different types of information that can be displayed using a HUD. Below is an outline of the most important stats displayed on video game HUDs

===== Health &amp; lives =====
Health is of extreme importance. Hence this is one of the most important HUD Stats on display. This contains information about the player's character or about NPC's, such as allies and enemies. RTS games (e.g. Starcraft) usually display the health level of all units that are visible on screen. In many action oriented games (first- or third-person shooters) the screen flashes briefly, when the player is attacked, and shows arrows indicating the direction the threat came from.

===== Weapons &amp; items =====
Most action games (first- and third-person shooters in particular) show information about the weapons currently used, ammunition left, other weapons, objects or items that are available.

===== Menus =====
Menus for different game related aspects (e.g. start game, exit game or change settings).

===== Time =====
[[Image:Warzone_2100_-_base.jpg|right|thumb|HUD of the RTS game Warzone 2100.]]
This contains timer counting up or down to display information about certain events (e.g. end of round), records such as lap times or the length of time a player can last in survival based game. HUDS can be used to display in-game time (time, day, year within the game) or even show real time.

===== Context-sensitive Information =====
This contains information that are only shown when necessary or important (e.g. tutorial messages, one/off abilities, subtitles or action events).

===== Game progression =====
This contains information about the player's current game progress (e.g. stats on a gamer's progress within one particular task or quest, accumulated experience points or a gamer's current level). It also includes information about the player's current task.

===== Mini-maps, Compass, Quest-Arrow =====
Games are all about reaching objectives, so HUDs must clearly state them, either in the form of a compass or quest arrow. A small map of the area that can act like a radar, showing the terrain, allies and/or enemies, locations like safe houses and shops or streets.

===== Speedometer =====
Used in most games that feature drivable vehicles. Usually shown only when driving one of these.

===== Cursor &amp; Crosshair =====
The crosshair indicates the direction the player is pointing or aiming to.

==== Examples ====

# [http://feedgrids.com/originals/post/a_look_through_14_beautiful_video_game_hud_designs Beautiful video game HUD designs]
# [http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/149668/the-10-best-huds-in-gaming/ Great HUDs in gaming]
# [http://www.giantbomb.com/no-hud/92-569/games/ Games without using HUDs]

==== Less is more ====
In order to increase realism information normally displayed using a HUD can be instead disguised as part of the scenery or part of the vehicle the player is using. For example, when the player is driving a car that can sustain a certain number of hits, a smoke trail or fire might appear from the car to indicate that the car is seriously damaged and will break down soon. Wounds and bloodstains may sometimes appear on injured characters who may also limp or breathe heavily to indicate that they are injured.

In some cases, no HUD is displayed at all. Leaving the player to interpret the auditory and visual cues in the game world creates a more intense athmosphere.

=== Text in HUD ===
Every font installed on your computer can be used to display text in your HUD. Therefore the font has to be added as an &quot;Existing file&quot; to the project in Visual Studio. Afterwards a .spritefont (XML) file can be found in the content folder of your project. There all parameters, such as style, size or kerning, can be easily configured.
==== Loading fonts ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
SpriteFont spriteFont = contentManager.Load&lt;SpriteFont&gt;(&quot;Path//Fontname&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;
==== Displaying fonts ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
spriteBatch.DrawString(spriteFont, textLabel + &quot;: &quot; + textValue, position, textColor);
&lt;/source&gt;
==== (Semi-)Transparency ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
Color myTransparentColor = new Color(0, 0, 0, 127);
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Background ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
Rectangle rectangle = new Rectangle();
rectangle.Width = spriteFont.MeasureString(text).X + 10;
rectangle.Height = spriteFont.MeasureString(text).Y + 10;

Texture2D texture = new Texture2D(graphicsDevice, 1, 1);
texture.SetData(new Color[] {color});

spriteBatch.Draw(texture, rectangle, color);
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Images in HUD ===
Since there is no concept of drawing on canvas elements, images or sprites are an important element for creating HUDs. XNA supports many different image formats, such as .jpeg or .png (including transparency).
==== Loading Images ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
contentManager.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(&quot;Path//Filename&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

or you could try this one : 

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
contentManager.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(@&quot;Path/Filename&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

With this aproach we use the default &quot;content&quot; folder and the &quot;doubled&quot; (&quot;//&quot;) slash is not necessary.

==== Displaying images ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
spriteBatch.Draw(image, position, null, color, 0 , new Vector2(backgroundImage.Width/2, backgroundImage.Height/2), scale, SpriteEffects.None, 0);             
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Components ===
The following components are templates that are ready to use. They can be easily customized to fit the individual requirements.

==== Bar ====
[[Image:XNA_Bar_HUD_Component.png‎|thumb|right|Bar HUD component in XNA game.]]
===== Information =====
This component displays a bar. I can be used to display any kind of information that is related to percentages (e.g. fuel, health or time left to reach an objective). The current percent value is represented by the length of the colore bar. Accordingly to the displayed value, the color changes from green over yellow to red.

== Sprites ==
==== What are Sprites? ====

Sprites are two dimensional image.The best known sprite is the mouse pointer. 

Sprites are not only used in 2D games but sprites are also used in 3D games for example,

for splash screens, menus, explosions and fire.These graphics based on the followed coordinate system.

[[File:Koordinatensystem.jpg]]

== Creating Sprites ==
[[File:StarFirst.png|thumb|my sprite &quot;star&quot;]]
Important to creating a Sprite you should know that the file can be bmp, png or jpg.
Most suitable are painting programms for creating Sprites such as Adobe Photoshop.
For animations sprite sheets are necessary.
Individual animation steps must be arranged in tabular form in the file.

== Using of Sprites in XNA Games == 

==== Add Sprites ====
add the image to the project
right click on the content file

:&quot;add&quot;
::new element--&gt;&gt; bitmap --&gt;&gt; you can draw in visual studio your own bitmap graphic
::existing element--&gt;&gt; ..select a graphic on your own data structure
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br/ &gt;

Let's create a few Texture2D objects to store our images.
Add the following two lines of code as instance variables to our game's main class:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;Texture2D landscape;
Texture2D star;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


load the images into our texture objects. In the LoadContent() method, add the following lines of code:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;landscape = Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(&quot;landscape1&quot;); // name of your images
star = Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(&quot;star&quot;);&lt;/source&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

==== Using SpriteBatch ====
SpriteBatch is the most important class of 2D drawing. The class contains methods for drawing sprite onto the screen. SpriteBatch have many usefull methods you can find all about these class by [http://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.spritebatch_members.aspx msdna libary].

The standard template of Visual Studio already has added a SpriteBatch object.&lt;br /&gt;

the instance variables in the main:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;SpriteBatch spriteBatch;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

a reference to this SpriteBatch class in the LoadContent() method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;protected override void LoadContent()
{
    // Create a new SpriteBatch
    spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(GraphicsDevice);
 
}
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


'''method Draw()'''--&gt;important

drawing with SpriteBatch&lt;ref&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.spritebatch.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
:SpriteBatch.Draw (Texture2D, Rectangle, Color);
:SpriteBatch.Draw (Texture2D, Vector, Color);&lt;br /&gt;
more about [http://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.spritebatch.draw.aspx SpriteBatch.Draw]&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)
       {
            graphics.GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.CornflowerBlue);

            spriteBatch.Begin();

            spriteBatch.Draw(landscape, new Rectangle(0, 0, 800, 500), Color.White);
            spriteBatch.Draw(star, new Vector2(350, 380), Color.White);//normal
 
            spriteBatch.End();
 
            base.Draw(gameTime);
       }&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

[[File:DrawPicture.jpg]]

==== Make Sprites smaller /bigger /semitransparent and/or rotate ====
SpriteBatch.Draw must be overloaded to reduce or enlarge or rotate or make transparent Sprites.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xnamag.de/article.php?aid=10&lt;/ref&gt;

In the method spriteBatch.Draw() we can give to a color value not only &quot;Color.White&quot; but also RGB and even an alpha value.&lt;br /&gt;
'''API:'''&lt;ref&gt;http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/microsoft.xna.framework.graphics.spritebatch.draw.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
SpriteBatch.Draw Methode (Texture2D, Vector2, Nullable&lt;Rectangle&gt;, Color, Single, Vector2, Single, SpriteEffects, Single)&lt;br /&gt;

public void Draw (
::Texture2D texture,
::Vector2 position,
::Nullable&lt;Rectangle&gt; sourceRectangle,
::Color color,======&gt;//this value can have an alpha value for transparent
::float rotation,====&gt;//this value is the radius at which the graphic is rotate
::Vector2 origin,===&gt;//this value is the point at which the graphic is rotate
::float scale,======&gt;//this value is important to reduce or enlarge sprites
::SpriteEffects effects,
::float layerDepth
)&lt;br /&gt;

more about the parameters find [http://msdn.microsoft.com/de-de/library/ff433988.aspx here]&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;spriteBatch.Draw(star,new Vector2(350,380),Color.White);//normal

spriteBatch.Draw(star,new Vector2(500,(380+(star.Height/2))),null,Color.White,0.0f,new Vector2(0,0),
0.5f,SpriteEffects.None,0.0f);//small

spriteBatch.Draw(star,new Vector2(200,(380-(star.Height/2))),null,Color.White,0.0f,new Vector2(0,0),
1.5f,SpriteEffects.None,0.0f);//bigger

spriteBatch.Draw(star,new Vector2(650,380),null,Color.White,1.5f,new Vector2(star.Width/2,star.Height/2),
1.0f,SpriteEffects.None,0.0f);//rotate

spriteBatch.Draw(star,new Vector2(50,380),new Color(255,255,255,100));//semitransparent
&lt;/source&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

[[File:ChangeStar.jpg]]&lt;br /&gt;

==== Animated Sprites ==== 
First, make a '''sprite sheet''' in which a motion sequence is shown for example go, jump, bend, run .. &lt;br /&gt;


[[File:MakeSpriteSheet.png]]&lt;br /&gt;


Next add a new class named '''AnimateSprite''' and add the follow variables.
    
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;    public Texture2D Texture;     // texture

    private float totalElapsed;   // elapsed time

    private int rows;             // number of rows
    private int columns;          // number of columns
    private int width;            // width of a graphic
    private int height;           // height of a graphic
    private float animationSpeed; // pictures per second

    private int currentRow;       // current row
    private int currentColumn;    // current culmn&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


The class consists of three methods: LoadGraphic (loading of the texture and set the variable), Update (for updating or moving animation) and Draw (to draw the sprite).&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;LoadGraphic&lt;/u&gt;

In this method, the entire variable and the texture are assigned.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;public void LoadGraphic(
      Texture2D texture,
      int rows,
      int columns,
      int width,
      int height,
      int animationSpeed
      )
    {
        this.Texture = texture;
        this.rows = rows;
        this.columns = columns;
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
        this.animationSpeed = (float)1 / animationSpeed;

        totalElapsed = 0;
        currentRow = 0;
        currentColumn = 0;
    }&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xnamag.de/article.php?aid=14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Update&lt;/u&gt;

Here, the animation is updated.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;public void Update(float elapsed)
    {
        totalElapsed += elapsed;
        if (totalElapsed &gt; animationSpeed)
        {
            totalElapsed -= animationSpeed;

            currentColumn += 1;
            if (currentColumn &gt;= columns)
            {
                currentRow += 1;
                currentColumn = 0;

                if (currentRow &gt;= rows)
                {
                    currentRow = 0;
                }
            }

        }
}&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xnamag.de/article.php?aid=14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


&lt;u&gt;Draw&lt;/u&gt;

Here is the current frame is drawn.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;public void Draw(SpriteBatch spriteBatch, Vector2 position, Color color)
    {
        spriteBatch.Draw(
            Texture,
            new Rectangle((int)position.X, (int)position.Y, width, height),
            new Rectangle(
              currentColumn * width,
              currentRow * height,
              width, height),
            color
            );
    }
}&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xnamag.de/article.php?aid=14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;



'''Using in Game'''&lt;br /&gt;

add Code to class Game1&lt;br /&gt;
main:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;AnimateSprite starAnimate;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

LoadContent:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;starAnimate = new AnimateSprite();
starAnimate.LoadGraphic(Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(@&quot;spriteSheet&quot;), 3, 4, 132, 97, 4);&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Update:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;starAnimate.Update((float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalSeconds);&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Draw:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;starAnimate.Draw(spriteBatch, new Vector2(350, 380), Color.White);&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==== Drawing Textfonts ====

add the Font to the project
right click on the content file

:&quot;add&quot;
:: &quot;new element..&quot;
::: SpriteFont


This file is an XML file, in which font, font size, font effects (bold, italics, underline), letter spacing and characters to use are given.&lt;br /&gt;

From these data, XNA created the bitmap font.
To use German characters have to set the end value to 255.&lt;ref&gt;http://rbwhitaker.wikidot.com/drawing-text-with-spritefonts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;


the instance variables in the main:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;SpriteFont font;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

in the LoadContent() method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;font = Content.Load&lt;SpriteFont&gt;(&quot;SpriteFont1&quot;); //name of the Sprite(Look Content)&lt;/source&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

in the Draw() method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
spriteBatch.DrawString(font, &quot;walking Star!&quot;, new Vector2(50, 100), Color.White);&lt;/source&gt; &lt;br /&gt;

== Introduction ==

How do we implement and model a landscape which is based on XNA Framework into our game? This WIKI-entry will deal exactly with this problem. By example it will be shown how to create a landscape using a HeightMap. Furthermore we will create a texture, drag it onto our landscape and write loads of source code. Finally there will be some tips regarding topics related to Landscape Modeling.

A HeightMap (Wikipedia: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap HeightMap]) is nothing else than a greymap. So to say a 2D texture which points out the heights and depths of our landscape. Every pixel of the greymap is between 0 and 255 indicating our elevation. To create such a map use a program like Terragen. 

Terragen is a program used to create photorealistic landscape-images pretty quick. However it also is a perfect tool to create a HeightMap. Terragen is available in 2 versions (date: 05.06.2011) one version which has to be paid for - [http://www.planetside.co.uk/content/view/15/27/ Terragen 2] and a free version [http://www.planetside.co.uk/content/view/16/28/ Terragen Classic]. For our needs the free version is perfectly ok.











== Creating HeightMap ==

Enough of the introduction – let’s get started. After downloading and installing Terragen Classic we can see the following menu:

[[File:Terragen menu.jpg|thumb|none|Terragen menu.]]


On the left hand side we can see the buttons provided by Terragen. First step is to click on „Landscape“ and a new window will open up. Here we click on “Size” to adjust the size of our HeightMap – 257x257 or 513x513. Tip: If you already have a skybox implemented, use the size of your skybox image.
Next we click on “View/Sculpt” to model our HeightMap. You will see a black picture with a white arrow in it – that’s your camera perspective. You can adjust the perspective as you like by moving the arrow to the desired position. To start painting your terrain you need to click on “Basic Sculpting Tool” (1) located at the top left corner of your window. Now you can start to draw your landscape. Something like this should be the result: 

[[File:View sculp.jpg|thumb|none|Landscape View/Sculp window.]]


If you are not satisfied with your result you can always click on “Modify” within your landscape window and adjust certain settings like maximum height of your mountains. Another useful function is “Clear/Flatten” which resets your HeightMap so you can start all over again. When you are done painting your HeightMap, click on the button “3D Preview”. This is what it should look like (depending on what you have drawn):

[[File:3DPreview.jpg|thumb|none|350px|3D Preview window of the HeightMap.]]


To save your HeightMap click on „Export“ in the landscape menu and choose „Raw 8 bits“ as Export Method (1). Click on “Select File and Save…” name your HeightMap and save it to your Hard Drive.

[[File:Terrain Export.jpg|thumb|none|Terrain Export window.]]


We are nearly done with our HeightMap, which is now in .raw format. Finally we need to convert this format into something else by using a program like Photoshop or the free tool “XnView” ([http://www.xnview.de www.xnview.de]). Change your .raw format to .jpg, .bmp or .png because the “default Content Pipeline” from XNA can handle these formats as “Texture2D”.


== Creating Texture ==

What would our landscape be without texture? Therefore, let’s use Terragen to create one. To do so open the “Rendering Controls” within your Terragen menu.

First thing to do is adjust the size using „Image Size“ (1) depending on whatever size you made your HeightMap (512x512 or 256x256). In the Rendering Control Window, at the bottom right corner, position your camera so you can actually see you floor (2). To directly face the floor use the value -90 for pitch (3). This makes you directly look at your floor. Furthermore set the “Detail” – slider (4) to maximum in order to get the highest quality when rendering. Click on “Render Preview” (5) to get a preview of your texture. Alternatively you can open your “3D Preview” again, but your texture will not be shown rendered.

[[File:RenderingControl.jpg|thumb|none|Rendering Control window.]]


Any black spots on your texture will probably be shadows cast on your terrain. Click on the button „Lightning Conditions“ in the Terragen Menu and uncheck „Terrain Casts Shadows“ and „Clouds Casts Shadows“(1) to make them disappear.

[[File:Lightning Conditions.jpg|thumb|none|Lightning Conditions window.]]


Now you are done and can click on „Render Image“ (6) in your “Rendering Control”. Terragen now renders your texture which should look something like this:

[[File:RenderedTexture.jpg|thumb|none|rendered texture]]


You can also change the colour of your texture. To do so click on the “Landscape” button in your Terragen menu. Choose “Surface Map” (1) and click on “Edit” (2). The “Surface Layer” window will open up. Now click „Colour…“(3) to choose your colour. When you are satisfied with your texture save it to your Hard Drive.

[[File:ChangeColour.jpg|thumb|none|Change the texture colour.]]


Play around with the settings, render it and check the changes. If you choose the colour to white, this is what your texture should look like:

[[File:TextureWhite.jpg|thumb|none|Texture with a different colour.]]


Now we are done with the basics and finally reached our first goal – our own HeightMap and texture:

&lt;gallery&gt;

File:OurTexture.jpg|Our texture.
&lt;/gallery&gt;


= Implementation in XNA =

From now on we start working on implementing the HeightMap and the texture into XNA code. But to actually see something we need to start by programming a camera.


== Creating Camera Class ==

We create a new Project in Visual Studio 2008 and add a new class named „Camera“.

We start of by assigning some class variables. A matrix viewMatrix for the camera view and a projectionMatrix for the projection. The projectionMatrix converts the 3D camera view into a 2D image. To position our landscape later on, we will need another matrix terrainMatrix. Furthermore it would be nice if we could move or rotate our camera over our landscape. Therefore we declare Vector3 variables for position, alignment, movement and rotation of our camera.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
        // matrix for camera view and projection
        Matrix viewMatrix;
        Matrix projectionMatrix;

        // world matrix for our landscape
        public Matrix terrainMatrix;

        // actual camera position, direction, movement, rotation
        Vector3 position;
        Vector3 direction;
        Vector3 movement;
        Vector3 rotation;
&lt;/source&gt;


The camera constructor gets parameters to initialize all these variables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt; 
        public Camera(Vector3 position, Vector3 direction, Vector3 movement, Vector3 landscapePosition)
        {
            this.position = position;
            this.direction = direction;
            this.movement = movement;
            rotation = movement*0.02f;
            //camera position, view of camera, see what is over camera
            viewMatrix = Matrix.CreateLookAt(position, direction, Vector3.Up);
            //width and height of camera near plane, range of camera far plane (1-1000)
            projectionMatrix = Matrix.CreatePerspective(1.2f, 0.9f, 1.0f, 1000.0f);
            // positioning our landscape in camera start position
            terrainMatrix = Matrix.CreateTranslation(landscapePosition);
        }
&lt;/source&gt;


Now if you ask yourself what exactly the methods CreateLookAt(), CreatePerspective(), CreateTranslation() are doing, check the class library of XNA Framework -&gt; [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb203940%28v=XNAGameStudio.10%29.aspx XNA Framework Class Library Reference]. All methods are clearly described there. Keep the XNA Framework class library in mind to check all the methods unclear to you, because not all methods used in the source code will be explained in detail.

To exercise this at least once we use the method CreateTranslation(). Go to [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/bb195672%28v=XNAGameStudio.10%29.aspx Matrix.CreatePerspective Method (Single, Single, Single, Single)] and you will find a detailed description of all the parameters used by the method as well as their return values.

[[File:ParametersMatrix.CreatePerspective.jpg|thumb|350px|none|Parameters and return value CreatePerspective() method]]


Back to our camera class. Next step is to create an Update() method which will get a number as parameter. In this method we define the movement and rotation of our camera and calculate our new camera position at the end. We do that because when we create a camera in our Game1.cs later on, we can move our camera by using keyboard inputs. Every keyboard input sends a number which will be processed by the camera’s Update() method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt; 
        public void Update(int number)
        {
            Vector3 tempMovement = Vector3.Zero;
            Vector3 tempRotation = Vector3.Zero;
            //left
            if (number == 1)
            {
                tempMovement.X = +movement.X;
            }
            //right
            if (number == 2)
            {
                tempMovement.X = -movement.X;
            }
            //up
            if (number == 3)
            {
                tempMovement.Y = -movement.Y;
            }
            //down
            if (number == 4)
            {
                tempMovement.Y = +movement.Y;
            }
            //backward (zoomOut)
            if (number == 5)
            {
                tempMovement.Z = -movement.Z;
            }
            //forward (zoomIn)
            if (number == 6)
            {
                tempMovement.Z = +movement.Z;
            }
            //left rotation
            if (number == 7)
            {
                tempRotation.Y = -rotation.Y;
            }
            //right rotation
            if (number == 8)
            {
                tempRotation.Y = +rotation.Y;
            }
            //forward rotation
            if (number == 9)
            {
                tempRotation.X = -rotation.X;
            }
            //backward rotation
            if (number == 10)
            {
                tempRotation.X = +rotation.X;
            }

            //move camera to new position
            viewMatrix = viewMatrix * Matrix.CreateRotationX(tempRotation.X) * Matrix.CreateRotationY(tempRotation.Y) * Matrix.CreateTranslation(tempMovement);
            //update position
            position += tempMovement;
            direction += tempRotation;
        }
&lt;/source&gt;


Finally our camera gets a Draw() method. In this method we pass our landscape to ensure it gets displayed later on.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt; 
        public void Draw(Terrain terrain)
        {
            terrain.basicEffect.Begin();
            SetEffects(terrain.basicEffect);
            foreach (EffectPass pass in terrain.basicEffect.CurrentTechnique.Passes)
            {
                pass.Begin();
                terrain.Draw();
                pass.End();
            }
            terrain.basicEffect.End();
        }
&lt;/source&gt;


Before we can start to write our Terrain.cs class we need to implement the method SetEffects() which is used by the Draw() method. BasicEffect is a class in XNA Framework which provides rendering effects to display objects.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
        public void SetEffects(BasicEffect basicEffect)
        {
            basicEffect.View = viewMatrix;
            basicEffect.Projection = projectionMatrix;
            basicEffect.World = terrainMatrix;
        }
&lt;/source&gt;


Now our Camera.cs class is ready and to actually see something we now start to write our Terrain.cs class.


=== Overview Camera.cs class ===

This is how the complete Camera.cs class should look like.

            }
            //forward (zoomIn)

            }
            //right rotation
            if (number == 8)
            {
                tempRotation.Y = +rotation.Y;
            }
            //forward rotation
            if (number == 9)
            {
                tempRotation.X = -rotation.X;
            }
            //backward rotation
            if (number == 10)
            {
                tempRotation.X = +rotation.X;
            }

            //move camera to new position
            viewMatrix = viewMatrix * Matrix.CreateRotationX(tempRotation.X) * Matrix.CreateRotationY(tempRotation.Y) * Matrix.CreateTranslation(tempMovement);
            //update position
            position += tempMovement;
            direction += tempRotation;
        }

        public void SetEffects(BasicEffect basicEffect)
        {
            basicEffect.View = viewMatrix;
            basicEffect.Projection = projectionMatrix;
            basicEffect.World = terrainMatrix;
        }
                
        public void Draw(Terrain terrain)
        {
            terrain.basicEffect.Begin();
            SetEffects(terrain.basicEffect);
            foreach (EffectPass pass in terrain.basicEffect.CurrentTechnique.Passes)
            {
                pass.Begin();
                terrain.Draw();
                pass.End();
            }
            terrain.basicEffect.End();
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Creating Landscape Class ==

Create a new class and rename it Terrain.cs. Again we start by defining class variables we will need. We will need Texture2D variables for our HeightMap and our texture image as well as variables to work with the textures, especially arrays.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
        GraphicsDevice graphicsDevice;

        // heightMap
        Texture2D heightMap;
        Texture2D heightMapTexture;
        VertexPositionTexture[] vertices;
        int width; 
        int height;

        public BasicEffect basicEffect;
        int[] indices;

        // array to read heightMap data
        float[,] heightMapData;
&lt;/source&gt;


In the constructor of our Terrain.cs we call the GraphicsDevice unit in order to be able to access it in our class.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
        public Terrain(GraphicsDevice graphicsDevice)
        {
            this.graphicsDevice = graphicsDevice;
        }
&lt;/source&gt;


Now we create a method which will get our textures (this will happen from the Game1.cs class and will be explained later) and calls other methods so we get closer to our landscape. So let’s write the missing methods. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
        public void SetHeightMapData(Texture2D heightMap, Texture2D heightMapTexture)
        {
            this.heightMap = heightMap;
            this.heightMapTexture = heightMapTexture;
            width = heightMap.Width;
            height = heightMap.Height;
            SetHeights();
            SetVertices();
            SetIndices();
            SetEffects();
        }
&lt;/source&gt;


We start by implementing the SetHeight() method which will get the greyscale from each pixel of the texture, indicating its actual height, and writes them into the heightMapData[] array. The complete method:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
public void SetHeights()
        {
            Color[] greyValues = new Color[width * height];
            heightMap.GetData(greyValues);
            heightMapData = new float[width, height];
            for (int x = 0; x &lt; width; x++)
            {
                for (int y = 0; y &lt; height; y++)
                {
                    heightMapData[x, y] = greyValues[x + y * width].G / 3.1f;
                }
            }
        }
&lt;/source&gt;


To get the intensity of each greyscale it is suffice to get the value of a single colour, either red, green or blue – which one you choose is up to you. To not get to much difference in altitude you can divide your colourvalue by a value. Hence this line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
heightMapData[x, y] = greyValues[x + y * width].G / 3.1f;
&lt;/source&gt;


It also works the other way around. When you multipliy with a value you will get a higher difference in altitude.

The next two methods deal with the creation of indices and vertices. SetVertice() creates the area of our landscape using triangles. An area consist of two triangles. A triangle can be described by 3 numbers which are called indices. These indices of a triangle are assigned to vertices. If you need a refreshment in that matter go check Riemer’s XNA Tutorials -&gt; [http://www.riemers.net/eng/Tutorials/XNA/Csharp/Series1/Indices.php Recycling vertices using inidices].

In our method some strange mathematical stuff is used to calculate correct indices. Play around a bit and check out what happens when you change certain values.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt; 
        public void SetIndices()
        {
            // amount of triangles
            index = new int[6 * (width - 1) * (height - 1)];
            int number = 0;
            // collect data for corners
            for (int y = 0; y &lt; height - 1; y++)
                for (int x = 0; x &lt; width - 1; x++)
                {
                    // create double triangles
                    index[number] = x + (y + 1) * width;      // up left
                    index[number + 1] = x + y * width + 1;        // down right
                    index[number + 2] = x + y * width;            // down left
                    index[number + 3] = x + (y + 1) * width;      // up left
                    index[number + 4] = x + (y + 1) * width + 1;  // up right
                    index[number + 5] = x + y * width + 1;        // down right
                    number += 6;
                }
        }
&lt;/source&gt;


The SetVertices() method calcualtes the 2D-position for each vertex the texture should be applied. The heights and depths will be assigned using the data from the heightMapData[] array.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
public void SetVertices()
        {
            vertices = new VertexPositionTexture[width * height];
            Vector2 texturePosition;
            for (int x = 0; x &lt; width; x++)
            {
                for (int y = 0; y &lt; height; y++)
                {
                    texturePosition = new Vector2((float)x / 25.5f, (float)y / 25.5f);
                    vertices[x + y * width] = new VertexPositionTexture(new Vector3(x, heightMapData[x, y], -y), texturePosition);
                }
                graphicsDevice.VertexDeclaration = new VertexDeclaration(graphicsDevice, VertexPositionTexture.VertexElements);
            }
        }
&lt;/source&gt;


Now we implement a SetEffects() method in which we use a new shader object of type BasicEffet  (Wikipedia: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shader Shader]). Its texture properties get assigned to our terrain texture and its display gets activated.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt; 
        public void SetEffects()
        {
            basicEffect = new BasicEffect(graphicsDevice, null);
            basicEffect.Texture = heightMapTexture;
            basicEffect.TextureEnabled = true;
        }
&lt;/source&gt;


To actually draw the landscape our terrain.cs class gets an own Draw() method. From here we call the method DrawUserIndexedPrimitives()(from GraphicsDevice class from XNA) which is extremely powerful and contains a pretty long list of parameters. First the type of object that is to be drawn. A collection of triangles is meant when using TriangleList. Followed by our array containing the vertices. The next parameters take the starting point and the ammount of our vertices. Next is the array with our indices and at the end the number of the first triangle and the ammount of triangles.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
        public void Draw()
        {
           graphicsDevice.DrawUserIndexedPrimitives&lt;VertexPositionTexture&gt;(PrimitiveType.TriangleList, vertices, 0, vertices.Length, indices, 0, indices.Length / 3);
        }
&lt;/source&gt;


Last but not least we need to adjust our Game1.cs in which we now call our camera and our terrain to reach or goal to see our landscape.

        }
        
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;


== Adjusting  Game1.cs class ==

Before we start we import our HeightMap as well as our texture image into VisualStudio2008. Right click on content in your project-explorer. Choose &quot;Add&quot; –&gt; &quot;existing Element…&quot; in the menu popping up. Choose your images and import them. You now should see your HeightMap and your texture image listed under Content.
Now create your camera and your terrain as class variables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
        //-------------CAMERA------------------
        Camera camera;

        //-------------TERRAIN-----------------
        Terrain landscape;
&lt;/source&gt;


To let VisualStudio2008 know where to find your images, add the following line to the constructor:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
Content.RootDirectory = &quot;Content&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;


Next initialize your camera and your terrain using the Initialize() method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
            // initialize camera start position
            camera = new Camera(new Vector3(-100, 0, 0), Vector3.Zero, new Vector3(2, 2, 2), new Vector3(0, -100, 256));
                   
            // initialize terrain
            landscape = new Terrain(GraphicsDevice); 
&lt;/source&gt;


If you later dont see anything you might need to adjust your Vector3 vectors which are passed into the camera class.

The following line from the LoadContent() method is used to load the HeightMap and texture image into your terrain class:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
            //load heightMap and heightMapTexture to create landscape
           landscape.SetHeightMapData(Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(&quot;heightMap&quot;), Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(&quot;heightMapTexture&quot;));
&lt;/source&gt;


Because we programmed our camera class forward-looking and want to move our camera over our terrain, we simply need to define the keys for movement in our Update() method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// move camera position with keyboard
            KeyboardState key = Keyboard.GetState();
            if (key.IsKeyDown(Keys.A))
            {
                camera.Update(1);
            }
            if (key.IsKeyDown(Keys.D))
            {
                camera.Update(2);
            }
            if (key.IsKeyDown(Keys.W)) 
            { 
                camera.Update(3); 
            }
            if (key.IsKeyDown(Keys.S))
            {
                camera.Update(4);
            }
            if (key.IsKeyDown(Keys.F))
            {
                camera.Update(5);
            }
            if (key.IsKeyDown(Keys.R))
            {
                camera.Update(6);
            }
            if (key.IsKeyDown(Keys.Q))
            {
                camera.Update(7);
            }
            if (key.IsKeyDown(Keys.E))
            {
                camera.Update(8);
            }
            if (key.IsKeyDown(Keys.G))
            {
                camera.Update(9);
            }
            if (key.IsKeyDown(Keys.T))
            {
                camera.Update(10);
            }
&lt;/source&gt;


Last but not least we need to tell the camera’s Draw() method to draw our landscape.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
            // to get landscape viewable
            camera.Draw(landscape);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;big&gt;Congratualtions&lt;/big&gt; – we are done.

As result of your work you should now see your landscape with your HeightMap and your texture generated by the Debugger. Furthermore you can move your camera over your terrain to confirm to really have heights and depths.

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:LandscapeWithTexture.jpg|Landscape with texture.
File:LandscapeWhiteTexture.jpg|Landscape with a different texture.
&lt;/gallery&gt;


If you are interested in how your landscape looks like as a grid of triangles, go to the SetEffects() method of your Terrain.cs class and modify it like this :

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt; 
        public void SetEffects()
        {
            basicEffect = new BasicEffect(graphicsDevice, null);
            basicEffect.Texture = heightMapTexture;
            basicEffect.TextureEnabled = false;
            graphicsDevice.RenderState.FillMode = FillMode.WireFrame;
        }
 &lt;/source&gt;


&lt;gallery&gt;
File:GridLandscape1.jpg|Landscape as grid.
File:GridLandscape2.jpg|Closer zoom on the landscape.
&lt;/gallery&gt;


Now you can easily replace your whole landscape by simply using a different HeightMap. Same applies for the texture. Just use the new names of your new images as parameters in the SetHeightMapData() method in your Terrain.cs class.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt; 
landscape.SetHeightMapData(Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(&quot;heightMap&quot;), Content.Load&lt;Texture2D&gt;(&quot;heightMapTexture&quot;));
&lt;/source&gt;


== Related topics ==

Unfortunately the Basic-Shader from XNA (BasicEffect) can handle only one texture. To improve your landscape you could now write your own EffectShader file which would handle more than one texture. If you are interested in shaders check [[Game_Creation_with_XNA/3D_Development/Shaders_and_Effects|Game Creation with XNA/3D Development/Shaders and Effects]]. You could make your landscape more interesting using multitexturing.

It is also possible to create a landscape using a 3D Modeling Software and import it as .x or .fbx file. Doing so will require more CPU-Power and knowledge of 3D Modeling Software though. Check [[Game_Creation_with_XNA/3D_Development/Importing_Models|Game Creation with XNA/3D Development/Importing Models]].

Another really complex topic would be collision detection for an object moving on the surface of your landscape. Check [[Game_Creation_with_XNA/Mathematics_Physics/Collision_Detection|Game Creation with XNA/Mathematics Physics/Collision Detection]].
A short introduction using the image below.

[[File:Interpolation.jpg|thumb|none|Interpolation]]


The blue circle is the object (maybe your game character). This object always has to request the y-position of you landscape for the direction it is moving in (green line). To get a smooth movement when the altitude of your landscape changes you need to interpolate (Wikipedia: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpolate Interpolate]) the y-value of your object’s vector at its current position with the new y-value of your landscape’s vector (the destination). The y-value of the landscape in the image changes from 15 to 23.

== Character Animation ==
''Here we have to distinguish between skeletal and keyframed animation.  The main point is to show how to get both types of animation working with XNA.  Special attention should be places on contraints given by the XNA framework (e.g. the shader 2.0 model does not allow more than 59 joints).''

==  Introduction ==
Animation is just an illusion- it is created by a series of images. Each is a little different from the last. We just feel such a group of images as a changing scene.&lt;br/&gt;
''The most common method of presenting animation is as a motion picture or video program, although there are other methods.'' [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animation]&lt;br/&gt;
In Computer based animation there are two forms of it: The little more &quot;classical&quot;, from flip-books known keyframe animation and the skeletal animation, which is by default known from 3d-animation.

== Keyframed Animation ==
[[File:Muybridge_race_horse_animated.gif|thumb|Keyframe Anim.&lt;br /&gt;
http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Muybridge_race_horse_animated.gif]]&lt;br /&gt;
Keyframe animation is an animation technique, that originially was used in classical cartoons.
A Keyframe defines the start- and endpoint of an animation. they are filled with so called interframes or inbetweens.
===History, Tradional Keyframe Animation===
In the traditioal keyframe animation, which e.g. was used for hand-drawn trickfilms, the senior artist (or key artist) would draw the keyframes. (Just the important pictures of an animation)
After testing of the rough animation, he gives this to his assistand, and the assistand does the necessary &quot;inbetweens and the clean up.

===Computergraphics===
In Computergraphics it is the same concept like in cartoon: The keyframes are created by the user and the interframes are supplemented by the computer. 
The &quot;Keyframe&quot; saves parameters such as position, rotation and scale of an object
The following inbetweens are interpolated by the computer.
====Example====
An Object will move from one corner to an other.
The first keyframe shows the object in the top left corner and the second keyframe shows it in the bottom right corner. Everything in between is interpolated.

&lt;gallery Caption=&quot;Example usage&quot;&gt;
Image:Motion Start.gif|&lt;center&gt;The Starting Keyframe&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Motion End.gif|&lt;center&gt;The Ending Keyframe&lt;/center&gt;
Image:Motion Animated.gif|&lt;center&gt;The Completed Animation&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;/gallery&gt;

''The preceding sections mentioned that some key-frame animations support multiple interpolation methods. An animation's interpolation describes how an animation transitions between values over its duration. By selecting which key frame type you use with your animation, you can define the interpolation method for that key frame segment. There are three different types of interpolation methods: linear, discrete, and splined.''
&lt;br/&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/uk-en/library/ms742524.aspx#]

====linear====
The individual segments are pass with constant speed.

====Discrete====
With discrete interpolation, the animation function jumps from one value to the next without interpolation.

====Spline Interpolation====

====Keyframe Animation in XNA====
'''to be edited'''
die einzelnen Parameter werden in einer Liste gespeichert.
Wenn man nun die Länge der Timeline und die anzahl der elemente hat, kann man hier draus schließen, auf welchen Keyframe man zu welcher Zeit zugreifen kann. (in dem der Timeline- Zähler hochgezählt wird und dann der entsprechende keyframe aufgerufen wird, ist es, als ob man z.b. bei einem daumenkino, bei dem 1 seite 1 keyframe ist, auf die enstsprechende Seite blättern würde).

Folgend ist eine klasse dargestellt, mit welcher dies umgesetzt werden kann. Die Quelle ist hier drunter zu finden.

== Skeletal Animation ==

Skeletal animation describes a/ the technique in computer animation which is represented in two parts, the skin part (called mesh) and the skeleton part (called rig). The skind is representet as a combination of sufaces and the skeleton is a combination of bones. These bones are connetect to each oter like real bones and part of a hierarchical set. The result is, you move one bone and the bones which should interact move too. The bones ainmate the mesh (the surfaces) in the same way. While this technique is often used to animate humans or more generally for organic modeling, it only serves to make the animation process more intuitive and the same technique can be used to control the deformation of any object, a building, a car..and so on.

[[File:Sintel-hand.png|thumb|left|Bones(green)]]



''This technique is quite useful for the animators because in all animation systems is this simple technique a port of. So they dont need any comlex algorithms to animate the models. Without this technique it is virtually impossible to animate the mesh in combination with the bones.''&lt;br/&gt;
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skeletal_animation

&lt;br/&gt;
===Rigging=== 

[[File:Blender3D ShuffleStride1.png |thumb|left|Skeleton-Legs)]]&lt;br/&gt;
Rigging is the technique to create a skeleton to animate a model. This ''skeleton'' consists of bones(rigs) and joins which are the connetion between the bones. Regularly you associates this bones and joins with the property of an real skeleton. For example you create first the upper leg as a bone and afterwards you build the knee as a join.&lt;br/&gt;
http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigging_%28Animation%29&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

----


===Skinning===
[[File:Blender3D IKWave.gif|thumb|left|Skin and Bones]]
Skinning is the technique to create a skin which is assigned to a wired frame (the bones) and the movement of the skin is like the movement of the bones.The skinning comes intuitive after the rigging. The differences between skinning and rigging is,skinning is the visual deformation of the body(your model).
Useful is the fact that it is possible to setup every single sufaces, this is very helpful in situations like the motion of an arm. Even you move your arm (or the arm of the model), your skin (the surfaces of the model) interact with the motion differently, determined by the position like at the inside of your elbow or at the outside of your elbow.
It is also possible to simulate muscular movement in this context. http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skinning

====The bones and polygons of your model have a limit in XNA:====
#Bones: 59 up to 79 in 4.0
#Polygons: depends on the hardware

=====Typical programs are:=====
*Motion Builder http://www.autodesk.de/adsk/servlet/pc/index?id=15013088&amp;siteID=403786 &lt;br/&gt;
*3ds Max http://www.autodesk.de/adsk/servlet/pc/index?id=14642267&amp;siteID=403786&lt;br/&gt;
*Maya http://www.autodesk.de/adsk/servlet/pc/index?siteID=403786&amp;id=14657512&lt;br/&gt;


===Animations in XNA===
The simplest way to get animations from your model in XNA is to create animations in your 3d development tool. These animations are automatically a part of your exported .x flile or .fbx file.

A simple way to show the handling with animations in XNA is a nice demo from http://create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/skinned_model.

First we need a model and a animation:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;Model currentModel;
        AnimationPlayer animationPlayer;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The next step is to update the LoadContent() method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;protected override void LoadContent()
        {
            // Load the model.
            currentModel = Content.Load&lt;Model&gt;(&quot;dude&quot;);

            // Look up our custom skinning information.
            SkinningData skinningData = currentModel.Tag as SkinningData;

            if (skinningData == null)
                throw new InvalidOperationException
                    (&quot;This model does not contain a SkinningData tag.&quot;);

            // Create an animation player, and start decoding an animation clip.
            animationPlayer = new AnimationPlayer(skinningData);

            AnimationClip clip = skinningData.AnimationClips[&quot;Take 001&quot;];

            animationPlayer.StartClip(clip);
        }&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

If you setup your clib variable as an array you can save a lot of different animations:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;AnimationClip clips= new AnimationClip[skinningData.AnimationClips.Keys.Count];
clips[0] = skinningData.AnimationClips[&quot;moveleft&quot;];
clips[1] = skinningData.AnimationClips[&quot;moveright&quot;];
clips[2] = skinningData.AnimationClips[&quot;jump&quot;];&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

After that is is easy to call the different animations, for example by dragging the jump key.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;animationPlayer.StartClip(clip[2]);&lt;/source&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

The same applies to all the others animations.

== Summary ==

=== What we learnt in this chapter ===
In this chapter we learned, how to animate our character in two different ways. First the keyframe-animation and than the skeleton-animation. These two techniques are the most important in xna. 

=== But which one is better? ===
Better in this context is the wrong word, lets replace the word &quot;better&quot; with the words &quot;better in which situation&quot;.
Its simple... use the skeleton-animation in 3D and the keyframe-animation in the 2D area.

== Menu and Help ==
Every game needs a game menu, and some games even provide help to the user.  Since for many games they are quite similar it makes sense to think of what most games will need and give some samples here, so that they can be used with small modifications in our game.  Menu's include Starting a new game, saving a game, configuring sound and input devices, etc.  Help maybe context sensitive, or may simply show the use which controls could be used.

      <comment>/* XACT Graphical User Interface */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''XACT (Cross-platform audio creation tool)''' is an audio creation and authoring tool from Microsoft. It comes with a graphical interface that allows sound designers to create audio resources for games, that can be integrated into XNA projects, offering the game developer a convenient way of accessing these sounds. It is part of Microsofts DirectX SDK and XNA Game Studio.
__TOC__
== Sound in XNA ==
To simply play a single audio file XNA you don’t have to use the heavy-weight XACT framework. Just import the file into your project’s Content folder and use Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Media.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;Song mySongsName;
mySong = Content.Load&lt;Song&gt;(&quot;theSongsAssetName&quot;);
MediaPlayer.Play(mySongsName);&lt;/source&gt;

== XACT ==
XACT is Microsoft‘s approach to establish an audio creation tool for all platforms. It can be used to develop software for Windows (XP, Vista and 7) and the Xbox. Technically XACT sits on top of other frameworks, which are specific to a single platform. XACT is not (yet) available on Microsoft’s mobile operating system’s such as (Zune and Windows Phone 7). The basic architecture of XACT looks like this:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
XACT supports playback of “normal” mono and stereo audio as well as of complex three dimensional audio.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
XACT itself consists of three parts. A graphical User Interface which is meant to be used by sound designers. An API to integrate the audio into your code and an command line tool to call some of its functions during the build process.

=== XACT Graphical User Interface ===
XACT’s Graphical User Interface is known as Authoring Tool and is a part of the XNA Game Studio and the DirectX Software Development Kit. It lets you organise sounds in logical units, so they can be accessed easily by name with the API afterwards. Microsoft’s goal was to make the process of organizing the sounds as easy as possible. Designers can edit the sounds without writing any code.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After installing it can be found under All Programs &gt; Microsoft DirectX SDK &gt; DirectX Utilities &gt; Microsoft Cross-Platform Audio Creation Tool (XACT).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
XACT main concept is based on Wave Banks, Sound Banks and Cues. Wave Banks are collections of actual audio files. Sound Banks instead just consist of commands or meta data, which specify cue points and related things. Those cue points are called events in this context. Supported events are play, stop, marker, set volume and set pitch.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
XACT also supports categories. Categories are used to group sounds to specify a certain set of features for those sounds. Each category may have multiple subcategories.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A Wave Bank supports two different modes “In Memory” and “Streaming”. As the name already says “In Memory” loads the complete audio data into the memory. This lets you access cues very fast but is not practical for long audio files, of course.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
XACT supports only uncompressed files in formats like .wav or .aiff (and WMA in newer versions). Inside the Wave Bank you can also specify if the audio data should be stored compressed (as xWMA) or as PCM.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Effects are also available in XACT. It uses a digital sound processor which is described on MSDN. It supports various usual effects like a reverb and a delay.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another feature of XACT are variables. The variables are basically the settings for several usual audio options like volume but also for more advanced ones like distance and orientation angle. Those values can then be modified while playing the sound in the code as described afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The authoring tool saves the data in .xap format which can be used to import the XACT project as an asset into your XNA project. The file does not contain the audio data itself, it only has references, which should stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:XACT Authoring Tool Screenshot.png|XACT Authoring Tool Screenshot]]

=== XACT API ===

The API is providing the interface to be used in the games code. When a .xap project is located in your Content folder the content pipeline makes sure that all needed files are accessible within your code. Nevertheless there are still some objects which must be instantiated in your Initialize() method of your Game class.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Those objects are of type AudioEngine, WaveBank and SoundBank. A basic version can be found on MSDN and looks like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;engine = new AudioEngine(&quot;Content\\PlaySound.xgs&quot;);
soundBank = new SoundBank(engine, &quot;Content\\Sound Bank.xsb&quot;);
waveBank = new WaveBank(engine, &quot;Content\\Wave Bank.xwb&quot;);&lt;/source&gt;

The instantiated AudioEngine object can then be updated inside the Update() method. It has it’s own Update() method, which should be called in there.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To modify 3D sound you can use predefined variables or your own variables specified via the Authoring Tool. This task can be done by using objects of type AudioEmitter and AudioListener.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

=== XACT command line tool ===

The command line tool can be used to build some XACT packages during the build process of your entire game. It is named XACT Auditioning Utility. It can be found in the “Tools” sub folder inside the application’s main folder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It can be also used to test .xap and other files created by the authoring tool.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
== C-Sharp ==
When coding for the XBox with the XNA framework, we will be using C-Sharp (C#) as programming language.  C-Sharp and Java are quite similar, so if you know one, basically you know the other.  A good introduction to C-Sharp is the Wikibook [[C_Sharp_Programming]].

C# has some features that are not available in Java, however, if you know C++ some may look familiar to you:
* properties
* enumerations
* boxing and unboxing
* operator overloading
* user-defined conversion (casting)
* structs
* read-only fields

The biggest difference between C-Sharp and Java probably are the delegates.  They are used for events, callbacks and for threading.  Simply put, delegates are function pointers.

=== Properties === 
This is an easy way to provide getter and setter methods for variables. It has no equivalent in Java, except if you consider the automatic feature of Eclipse to add these methods. Simply consider the following example, notice the use of the value keyword.

=== Enumerations === 
In Java you can use interfaces to store constants. In C# the enumeration type is used for this. Notice that it may only contain integral data types.

=== Boxing and Unboxing === 
This corresponds to Java’s wrapper types and also is available now in Java.  Interesting to notice is that the original and boxed  are not the same.  Also notice that unboxed stuff lives on the stack, whereas the boxed stuff lives in the heap.

=== Operator Overloading === 
This is a feature that you may know from C++, or you might consider the overloading of the ’+’ operator for the Java String class.  In C# you can overload the following operators:
* unary: +, -, !, +, ~, ++, --, true, false
* binary: +, -, *, /, %, &amp;, |, ^, &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;, ==, !=, &lt;, &gt;, &lt;=, &gt;=
For instance for vector and matrix data types it makes sense to overload the '+', '-' and the '*' operators.

=== User-Defined Conversion === 
Java has built-in casting, so does C#. In addition, C# allows for implicit and explicit casting, which means you define the casting behavior. Usually this makes sense between cousins in a class hierarchy.  However, there is a restriction: conversions already defined by the class hierarchy cannot be overridden.

=== Structs === 
Structs basically allow you to define objects that behave like primitive data types. Different from objects, which are stored on the heap, structs are actually stored on the stack. Structs are very similar to classes, they can have fields, methods, constructors, properties, events, operators, conversions and indexers. They can also implement interfaces. However, there are some differences:
* structs may not inherit from classes or other structs
* they have no destructor methods
* structs are passed by-value not by-reference

=== Read-Only Fields === 
When we were discussing the keyword const the difference to Java’s final was that you had to give a value to it at variable declaration time. A way around this is the readonly keyword. However it still has the restriction, that a readonly variable has to be initialized inside the constructor.

=== Delegates ===
Usually, in Java when you pass something to a method, it is a variable or an object. Now in C# it is also possible to pass methods. This is what delegates are all about. Note that delegates are also classes. One good way of understanding delegates is by thinking of a delegate as something that gives a name to a method signature. 

In addition to normal delegates there are also multicast delegates.  If a delegate has return type void, it can also become a multicast delegate.  So if a delegate is the call to one method, then a multicast delegate is the call to several methods, one after the other.

=== Callbacks === 
Callback methods are used quite often when programming C or C++ and they are extremely useful. The idea is instead of waiting on another thread to finish, we just give that thread a callback method, that it can call once its done. This is very important when there are tasks that would take a long time, but we want the user in the meanwhile to do other things. To accomplish this, C# uses delegates.

=== Inheritance ===
Object-oriented concepts in C# are very similar to Java’s. There is a few minor syntax related differences. Only with regard to method overwriting in an inheritance chain, C# provide more flexibility than Java.  It allows for a very fine-grained control over which polymorphic method actually will be called.  For this it uses the keywords 'virtual', 'new', and 'override'. In the base class you need to declare the method that you want to override as virtual.  Now in the derived class you have the choice between declaring the function 'virtual', 'new', or 'override'.

== Game Loop ==
Programming a game consoles (GC) is not quite the same as programming a regular PC.  Whereas PC's have sophisticated operating systems such as Windows, Linux or Mac OS, on a game console we are much closer to the hardware.  This has to do withe the special requirements of games.  We must consider the following differences between PC’s and GC's:
* on a GC usually only one (multithreaded) program is running, thus there is no real OS
* on a GC raw graphics power is needed, but there is no GUI with windows and widgets
* a GC usually has no keyboard, console, sometimes not even a harddisk
Hence, you will find no classes with names like Window, Form, Button or TextBox.  Instead you find classes with names such as Sprite, Texture2D and Vector3.  We talk about Content Pipeline, Textures and Shaders.

Usually, programs for PC's are event driven, meaning the user clicks somewhere something happens.  If the user doesn't click anywhere, nothing happens.  On game consoles (GC) this is a little different.  Here we often find the so-called ''Game Loop''.  For the Xbox 360, or rather the XNA framework, it consists of three methods:
* LoadContent()
* Update( GameTime time )
* Draw( GameTime time )

LoadContent() is called once at the start of the game to load images, sounds, textures, etc.  Update() is used for getting user input, updating the game state, handling AI and sound effects.  Draw() is called for displaying the game.  (MVC Pattern).  The Game Loop then consists of the two methods Update() and Draw() being called by the engine.  They are not neccessarily called in sequence!

= Skybox =
Skyboxes give a game a surrounding and grounding.  Be it a race car, ego-shooter or space simulation, the skybox makes the game feel more realistic.  At its most primitive version it is simply 6 images projected onto the sides of an imaginary cube way out at infinity.  Here we show you how to easily create simple skyboxes.  But skyboxes can be more complex also.  They can be dome shaped, they can simulate dusks and dawns with rising sun.  Also examples for how to create those are given.

==Creating a simple Skybox==
First you will need to create the six images for each cube face. There are several ways to accomplish this. However it depends on what you want in your scene. So you could could take the some digital pictures and generate the skybox from them. Another possibility would be use a skybox someone else created (public domain). Naturally, you have the most freedom if you create everything from scratch. And that’s what we are going to do. In the following our tool of choice will be [http://www.planetside.co.uk/content/view/15/27/ Terragen 2] (non-commercial version).

=== Creating Skybox Images with Terragen 2 ===
&lt;small&gt;My focus is on bringing you quick results rather than in depth information. 
If you have the desire to dig in deeper, please check out the tutorials i have based my guide on.&lt;/small&gt;

Once you have started Terragen, you see the default scene, consisting of a flat planet with an atmosphere.
First thing you want to do is to change this flat space into a more interesting landscape.

[[File:Terragen2 start landscape.png|none|frame|]]

==== Adding Terrain ====
You use [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heightmap heightfields] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_generation procedurals] to generate Terrain in Terragen 2.
===== Using Heightfields =====
* Select the &lt;u&gt;Heightfield generate&lt;/u&gt; node in the Terrain section [[File:Terragen2 terrain layout button.png]]

[[File:Terragen2 heightfield generate.png|none|frame|]]

* Hit the &lt;u&gt;Generate Now&lt;/u&gt; button and wait for the process to complete. The 3D preview now shows the new terrain.
* Enlarge the &lt;u&gt;navigation panel&lt;/u&gt; in the top right corner of the Terragen window [[File:Terragen2 navigation panel.png]]
* It will change to the full navigation control
* You can navigate through the scene using these controls. Play around with the parameters to get a feeling of  how they affect the terrain when you hit the &lt;u&gt;Generate Now&lt;/u&gt; button.
* Then go on and find a position you like e.g. on top of a mountain or hill.
* Locate the the &lt;u&gt;Copy To Current Camera&lt;/u&gt; button in the toolbar below the 3D preview section.  By clicking it you will change the render camera to your current view. Do so.
[[File:Terragen2 copy to camera button.png|none|frame|]]

* Hit the &lt;u&gt;Open Render View&lt;/u&gt; (R) button in the top toolbar and press the &lt;u&gt;Render&lt;/u&gt; button.
[[File:Terragen2 render button.png|none|frame|]]

Wait for the Renderer to complete and enjoy your first rendered view. Now use the &lt;u&gt;navigation controls&lt;/u&gt; to get to position very high above ground so you can see the horizon. You will notice that there is still a lot of flat surface. This is becasue of the limitations of Heightfields. We may want to change this now using Procedurals.

[[File:Terragen2 render1.png|none|frame| Mountains generated by heightfield]]&lt;br /&gt;

===== Using Procedurals =====

* First disable the &lt;u&gt;Heightfield shader&lt;/u&gt; by selecting it and unchecking the &lt;u&gt;Enable&lt;/u&gt; checkbox.
* The surface will be flat again now
* Click &lt;u&gt;Add Terrain&lt;/u&gt; and select &lt;u&gt;Power Fractal&lt;/u&gt;
* A new Power Fractal node will appear in the list. You may want to give it a good name an rename it to „mountains“
* Notice how the complete terrain has changed. mountains everywhere!
* Now select a good view point spot again using the &lt;u&gt;navigation controls&lt;/u&gt;. Choose a spot which has a good combination of altitudes, like a valley surrounded by mountains.
* Then again click the &lt;u&gt;Copy to Current Camera&lt;/u&gt; button in the toolbar below the 3D preview
* Hit the &lt;u&gt;Open Render View&lt;/u&gt; (R) button in the top toolbar and press the &lt;u&gt;Render&lt;/u&gt; button.  
[[File:Terragen2 render2.png|none|frame| Mountains generated by Power Fractal procedural]]

==== Texturing using Shaders ====
Now we will add better colors and textures using Shaders.

===== Modifying the mountain ground color =====
* Open the &lt;u&gt;Shaders&lt;/u&gt; layout [[File:Terragen2 shaders layout button.png]]
* Select the &lt;u&gt;Base colors&lt;/u&gt; node in the list and have a look at the parameters presented when clicking the &lt;u&gt;Colour&lt;/u&gt; tab
* Choose a brown color for the &lt;u&gt;high colour&lt;/u&gt; and adjust the &lt;u&gt;brightness&lt;/u&gt; by adjusting the slider. You can leave the &lt;u&gt;low colour&lt;/u&gt; for now. 

===== Adding a grass like texture =====
* Click the&lt;u&gt; Add Layer&lt;/u&gt; button above the node list and select &lt;u&gt;Surface Layer&lt;/u&gt; from the drop-down menu. A new shader node appears in the list.
* Now go to the&lt;u&gt; Colour Tab&lt;/u&gt; of the newly added shader and use the &lt;u&gt;color picker&lt;/u&gt; to select a green/yellow tone color.
* You may want to rename it to &quot;Grass&quot; as we are going to use this Shader to add Grass to the world.

* Go to the &lt;u&gt;Altitude constraints&lt;/u&gt; tab and turn the &lt;u&gt;Limit maximum altitude&lt;/u&gt; checkbox
* Set the &lt;u&gt;Maximum altitude&lt;/u&gt; to something between 400-500
* Change the &lt;u&gt;Max altitude fuzzy zone&lt;/u&gt; to a value around 100 (sharpness of cut-off at the altitude constraint)

* Go to the &lt;u&gt;Slope constraints&lt;/u&gt; tab and turn the &lt;u&gt;Limit maximum slope&lt;/u&gt; checkbox
* Set the &lt;u&gt;Maximum slope angle&lt;/u&gt; to something around 30 
* Change the &lt;u&gt;Max slope fuzzy zone&lt;/u&gt; to a value around 15

You may want to spend some time adjusting all parameters mentioned above to shape everything the way you like it to be.
Render to see the effects of your adjustments.

===== Controlling the appearance of the grass layer =====
* Go to the &lt;u&gt;Coverage and breakup&lt;/u&gt; tab.  &lt;u&gt;Coverage&lt;/u&gt; controls the amount of the underlying surfaces that will be covered by this layer. &lt;u&gt;Fractal breakup&lt;/u&gt; controls layer distribution. 
* Set Coverage to 0.7 and Fractal breakup to 1 to get a good result, but adjust it as you wish.

As you see it Terragen2 is a mighty tool, but this is just the beginning. You could go on and add snowy mountains, fast valleys and water and then integrate atmospherics and lightning.
We leave it for now and start building our skybox.

[[File:Terragen2 render3.png|frame|none| Rendered image with water, grass and snow textures, an atmosphere and sunlight]]

==== Camera Setup ====
Now you have to decide which point of view you want to present in your projects skybox. Go on an find a good spot using the &lt;u&gt;navigation controls&lt;/u&gt;.

* Click the &lt;u&gt;Renders&lt;/u&gt; layout button at the top of the screen. [[File:Terragen2 renderers layout button.png]]
*Select &lt;u&gt;/Full Render&lt;/u&gt; and then click the &lt;u&gt;add&lt;/u&gt; button. Select &lt;u&gt;Create new camera&lt;/u&gt; in the drop-down menu. Create four more cameras.

Switch to the &lt;u&gt;Cameras&lt;/u&gt; layout [[File:Terragen2 cameras layout button.png]]
Here you will see a list of your new cameras. And the default Render Camera. We will use these six cameras to render all views we need for the skybox. But first we have to configure them:
*Select the first camera and rename it to North. The three position fields describe your actual position and will differ from mine.
* Set the three values of the Rotation field to 0
* Select the Perspective radio button and then the Use horizontal fov radio button. Change the value to 90 degree.

Edit the other cameras as shown in the table below:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! !! Camera01 !! Camera02 !! Camera03 !! Camera04 !! Camera05 !! Camera06
|-
| Name || North || East || South || West || Up || Down
|-
| Position || a/b/c || a/b/c || a/b/c || a/b/c || a/b/c || a/b/c
|-
| Rotation || 0/0/0 || 0/90/0 || 0/180/0 || 0/270/0 || 90/0/0 || 270/0/0
|-
| Perspective || Selected || Selected || Selected || Selected || Selected || Selected
|-
| Horizontal FOV || Selected || Selected || Selected || Selected || Selected || Selected
|-
| Value || 90 || 90 || 90 || 90 || 90 || 90
|-
|}

'''''Note:''' a/b/c is a placeholder for '''your''' position values. Once you have found a camera positon you want to use for the skybox you can just copy the same values to all six cameras.'' 

Go back to to the &lt;u&gt;Renderers&lt;/u&gt; layout [[File:Terragen2 renderers layout button.png]]

* Select the &lt;u&gt;Quick Render&lt;/u&gt; and assign on of the six cameras to it using the &lt;u&gt;add&lt;/u&gt; in the Renderers details view.
* Click &lt;u&gt;Render Image&lt;/u&gt; to see a low quality render of it
* You might want to repeat this to check all cameras

==== Render/Quality Settings ====
There are two pre-configured Renderers in Terragen 2. The Full Render is intended to generate high-quality output. Therefore you will just use it when you want to test how your project really will look like, or you want to render and export. It depends on your settings but expect this renderer to take some time.
The Quick Render is intended to give you a quick impression and therefore the render time is short. Of course you can configure both of them matching your needs, or create additional Renderers. 

Now we are going to configure the Full Render and then create all images for the skybox.

Go to the&lt;u&gt; Renderers&lt;/u&gt; layout [[File:Terragen2 renderers layout button.png]]

* Select the Full Render and change &lt;u&gt;Image Width&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;Image height&lt;/u&gt; to 512
* Choose a camera using the &lt;u&gt;add&lt;/u&gt; button and assign it to the Renderer
* In the&lt;u&gt; Quality tab&lt;/u&gt; set the &lt;u&gt;Detail&lt;/u&gt; parameter to 1
* Now select the first camera from the camera drop-down list and press the Render Image button.
* Wait for the Renderer to finish
* Save the image to your disk by clicking the &lt;u&gt;Save&lt;/u&gt; button. As we are going to use with XNA you might want to save it as Windows Bitmap (.bmp)
* Then render the other cameras

'''&lt;u&gt;'''Note on using GI in your scene:'''&lt;/u&gt;''' &lt;br /&gt;
You might want to turn off GI (Global Illumination) by setting &lt;u&gt;GI relative detail&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;GI sample quality&lt;/u&gt; and &lt;u&gt;GI blur radius&lt;/u&gt; to zero.&lt;br /&gt;
This is because GI can lead to visible edges in your skybox. You may have to adjust your lightning configuration to lighten up you scene. 

[[File:Terragen2 full render configuration.png|none|frame|]]

Once you have rendered all cameras, you might want to align the images in your favorite image editing program, and check how they all fit together.

[[File:Skybox_example.png|none|frame| Skybox images aligned by their position in the skybox]]

== XNA integration ==
=== Creating a skybox cube map ===
One way to get your skybox into your XNA project is to generate a cube map file which you can easily load later on.
A quick and easy way to archive this is by using a tool called [http://developer.amd.com/archive/gpu/cubemapgen/pages/default.aspx CubeMapGen] from ATI.

[[File:ATI CubeMapGen.png|none|frame| Skybox cube map creation with CubeMapGen]]

In CupeMapGen:
* Select &lt;u&gt;D3D Cube&lt;/u&gt; as Export Image Layout
* Select the &lt;u&gt;Skybox&lt;/u&gt; checkbox in the Display section
* Now you can apply your skybox images to the cube faces, by selecting the cube face from the drop-down menu and then loading the corresponding image clicking the &lt;u&gt;Load CubeMap Face&lt;/u&gt; button.

Based on the alignment of the skybox images created earlier, the axis mapping is as follows:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! East !! West !! Up !! Down !! North !! South
|-
| X+ || X- || Y+ || Y- || Z+ || Z-
|}

Save the cube map as DDS file by clicking &lt;u&gt;Save CubeMap (.dds)&lt;/u&gt; button when done.

= Skydome = 
Same concept as a skybox but instead of a cube, a sphere is used. Can be used to simulate atmospherics and sun movement (dawn, dusk).&lt;br /&gt;

== Vectors and Matrices ==
We need to recall some basic facts about vector and matrix algebra, especially when trying to develop 3D games.  A nice introduction with XNA examples can be found in the book by Cawood and McGee. &lt;ref name=&quot;CM09&quot;&gt;S. Cawood and P. McGee (2009). ''Microsoft XNA Game Studio Creator’s Guide''. McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Trigono sine en2.svg|right|thumb|A right triangle showing the relation between opposite, adjacent and hypotenuse.]]
=== Right Triangle ===
Once upon a time there was little Hypotenuse.  He had two cousins: the Opposite and his sister the Adjacent.  Both were usually just known by their nick names 'Sine'&lt;ref&gt; [[Wikipedia:Sine]]&lt;/ref&gt; and 'Cosine'&lt;ref&gt; [[Wikipedia:Cosine]]&lt;/ref&gt;.  They lived together in a ''right triangle'' close to the woods.  They were related through his mother's sister, aunty Alpha.  His father, who was a mathematician, used to say that:
:&lt;math&gt;\sin \alpha = \frac {\textrm{opposite}} {\textrm{hypotenuse}} = \frac {a} {h} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos \alpha = \frac {\textrm{adjacent}} {\textrm{hypotenuse}} = \frac {b} {h}.&lt;/math&gt;

Sometimes he also referred to uncle Tangent (who was married to aunty Alpha) and said that
:&lt;math&gt;\tan \alpha = \frac {\textrm{opposite}} {\textrm{adjacent}} = \frac {a} {b},&lt;/math&gt;
so in a sense uncle Tangent of aunty Alpha was Sine divided by Cosine.  To us that didn't make any sense, but Hypotenuse's father said that was how it always was.

= Ballistics =

If one thinks about ballistics the first couple of things that come to mind are guns and various deadly bullets. But especially in games ballistics can be concerned with the movement of any kind of projectile, from balls to bananas and from coconuts to rockets.  
Ballisitcs help determine how these projectiles behave during movement and what their effects are&lt;ref&gt; [[Wikipedia:Ballistics]]&lt;/ref&gt;. This chapter will show and explain what a game programmer needs to know when programming anything related to projectiles. 
&lt;/br&gt;
== Basic Physics ==
The movement of any projectile will be heavily influenced by its surroundings and the physical laws it should abide by. However, it is important to remember that games do not need to be set on earth and the experience on an alien planet may be completely different from what we know to be valid. Therefore the here listed formulas and explanations may need adjustment to what ever world your are intending to let projectiles move around in. 

==== Mass and Weight==== 
It is a common misunderstanding that mass is the same thing as weight. But while the weight of an object can change depending on the environment it is placed in, the mass of an object will stay the same&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Mass]]&lt;/ref&gt;. Weight (denoted by W) is defined as a force that exist when [[#Gravity|gravity]] effects a mass&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Weight]]&lt;/ref&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;W = m g\,&lt;/math&gt; , where ''g'' is the gravity present and ''m'' denotes the mass of the object

==== Velocity and Acceleration ====
Velocity describes the distance covered by an object through movement over a certain amount of time and the direction of such movement. It is the speed and direction at which your car travels along the Highway or at which a bullet whizzes through the air . Probably the most commonly seen units to denote speed are ''km/h'' and ''m/s''. ''h'' and ''s'' represent a certain amount of time, where ''h'' stands for an hour and ''s'' for a second, ''km'' and ''m'' mean kilometer and meter, the distance traveled during this time interval. Velocity is defined by a vector which specifies the direction of movement and its absolute value is the speed.

Imagening a ball that is thrown, it will not have the same speed through its whole flight. It will speed up after leaving the hand and it will slow down eventually. This is called acceleration. It is the rate by which the speed of an object changes over time. Newton's second Law of motion shows that acceleration depends on the force that is exercised on an object (e.g the force from the arm and hand that throw the ball) and the mass of such object (eg. the ball): &lt;math&gt;F = m a\, \implies a = \frac{F}{m}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The acceleration of such object will be in the same direction as the applied force. The unit for acceleration is distance traveled over time squared, for example ''km/s²''.

==== Gravity ====
Universal gravitation is a force that takes effect between any two objects, drawing them torwards each other. This force depends on the objects' masses as well as their distance to each other.&lt;ref&gt;http://csep10.phys.utk.edu/astr161/lect/history/newtongrav.html&lt;/ref&gt; The general formula to calculate this force looks like this:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2} &lt;/math&gt;   ,where &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m_2&lt;/math&gt; are the objects' masses, ''r'' is the distance and ''G'' the universal gravitational constant&lt;br&gt;
The universal gravitational constant is:&lt;ref&gt;{{CODATA2006|url=http://www.physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Value?bg}}.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;math&gt; G = 6.67428 \times 10^{-11} \ \mbox{m}^3 \ \mbox{kg}^{-1} \ \mbox{s}^{-2} = 6.67428 \times 10^{-11} \ {\rm N}\, {\rm (m/kg)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

When talking about the gravity of earth, the acceleration experienced by a mass because of the existing attractive force, is meant. So gravity is nothing other than acceleration torwards the earth's mid point. This is why an object, dropped from a high building, will continue to be in free fall until it is stopped by another object, for example the ground. The gravity of earth is defined as follows: 
&lt;math&gt;g= G \frac{m_{earth}}{r^2} &lt;/math&gt;  , where ''g'' is the gravity of earth, ''m'' the earth's mass and ''r'' its radius&lt;br&gt;
The earth's gravity on the surface equals approximately 9.8 meters/second².

==== Drag ====
Drag influences the velocity of objects moving through fluids and gases. This force is opposite to the direction of the object's movement and it hence reduces the object's speed over time. It depends on the objects mass and shape as well the density of the fluid. Because the flight path computation is usually simplified you might not end up needing the drag force. You should however consider the fluid and gases your projectile moves in and fiddle around with the scaling factors to get an appropriate flight path.
&lt;/br&gt;

== Projectile Movement ==
In games the world a player acts in is never really a hundred percent accurate representation of the real world. Therefore when programming movement of projectiles it is easier to simplify some of the physics while creating the illusion that the projectile is at least somewhat behaving like a human player would expect it to do. 
No matter if throwing a ball or shooting a torpedo under water there are two general and simplified patterns how projectiles move in games. These movements can be adapted and refined to match the expected movement of a specific projectile.

=== Projectile Class ===
It is advisable to make your own projectile class that includes all projectile specific variables like velocity as well as functions to manipulate and calculate the flight path. The class' basic framework could look something like this:
&lt;source lang=csharp &gt;
public class Projectile{

private Vector3 velocity;   //stores the direction and speed of the projectile
public Vector3 pos;         //current projectile position
private Vector3 prevPos;    //previous projectile position
private float totalTimePassed;         //time passed since start 
public bool bmoving = false;        //if the projectile is moving

///Constants
private const float GRAVITY = 9.8f;

    public void Start(Vector3 direction,int speed, Vector3 startPos){
        this.velocity = speed*Vector3.Normalize(direction);   
        this.pos = startPos;   //in the beginning the current position is the start position
        bmoving = true;
    }
     
    public void UpdateLinear(GameTime time){
        if(bmoving) LinearFlight(time);
    }
    
    public void UpdateArching(GameTime time){
        if(bmoving) ArchingFlight(time);
    }
}

&lt;/source&gt;

To start with something needs to trigger the movement of the projectile, for example the players mouse click. On that event you create a new instance of your projectile class and call Start() to launch the projectile. You will need to keep a reference to this object because the projectiles position is going to be updated every frame and the projectile is redrawn. The update is done be calling either the UpdateLinear or UpdateArching function, depending on the flight path that's wanted. The new position will have to be part of the transformation matrix that is used to draw the projectile in your game world. 

In the Start method the direction vector is normalized to ensure that when multiplied by the speed the result is a velocity vector with the same direction as the initial vector and the absolute value of the desired speed. Remember that the direction vector passed to the Start function is the aim vector of whatever made the projectile move in the first place. Its absolute value can basically be anything when we assume the aim is changeable. Hence, this would not guarantee projectiles of the same kind moving at the same speed, nor would it allow for the player to decide on the force that is excersiced on the projectile before its release, changing its speed accordingly. 

If your projectile is of a form that has an obvious front, end and sides it will become necessary to change the projectiles orientation according to its flight path. Following Euler's rotation theorem, vectors of a rotation matrix have to be unit vectors as well as orthogonal&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikipedia:Rotation representation (mathematics)]]&lt;/ref&gt;. For a linear flight path we could simply take the normalized velocity vector as forward vector of the orientation matrix and construct the matrix's right and up vector accordingly. However, because the projectile's flight direction constantly changes when using an arching flight path it is easier to recalculate the forward vector each update by subtracting the projectile's current position from the position held an update earlier. To do so put the following function in your projectile class. Remember to call it before drawing the projectile and put the result matrix into the appropriate transformation matrix following I.S.R.O.T sequence. This sequence specifies the order by which to multiply the transform matrices, namely the &lt;b&gt;I&lt;/b&gt;dentiy Matrix, &lt;b&gt;S&lt;/b&gt;caling, &lt;b&gt;R&lt;/b&gt;otation, &lt;b&gt;O&lt;/b&gt;rientation and &lt;b&gt;T&lt;/b&gt;ranslation.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;source lang=csharp &gt;
public Matrix ConstructOrientationMatrix(){
    Matrix orientation = new Matrix();

    // get orthogonal vectors dependant on the projectile's aim
    Vector3 forward = pos - prevPos;     
    Vector3 right = Vector3.Cross(new Vector3(0,1,0),forward);
    Vector3 up = Vector3.Cross(right,forward);

    // normalize vectors, put them into 4x4 matrix for further transforms
    orientation.Right = Vector3.Normalize(right);
    orientation.Up = Vector3.Normalize(up);
    orientation.Forward = Vector3.Normalize(forward);
    orientation.M44 = 1;  
    return orientation; 
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;

=== Linear Flight===
[[File:Linear_movement_of_a_projectile.png|thumb| Shows the linear movement of a ball with the velocity of (5,3,2)]]
A linear flight is the movement along a straight line. This kind of movement might be observed when a ball is thrown straight and very fast. Obviously, even a ball like that will eventually fall to the ground if not stopped before. However, if it is for example caught quite early after leaving the throwers hand its flight path will look linear. 
To simplify this movement, acceleration and gravity are neglected and the velocity is the same at all time. The direction of movement is given by the velocity vector and is the same as the aim direction of the gun,hand etc.  

If you have active projectiles in your game, the XNA Update function needs to call a function that updates the position for every active projectile object. The projectile's new position is calculate like this: &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;pos= pos + velocity\times{timePassed} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{XNAGameStudio}}&lt;/ref&gt; , where ''timePassed'' is the time that has passed since the last update. &lt;br&gt;

All this function needs as a parameter is the game time that has passed since the last update. Cawood and McGee suggest to scale this time by dividing it by 90 because otherwise the positions calculated for every frame will be to far apart. 
&lt;source lang=csharp&gt;
private void LinearFlight(GameTime timePassed){
    prevPos = pos; 
    pos = pos + velocity * ((float)timePassed.ElapsedGameTime.Milliseconds/90.0f);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;

=== Arching Flight===
[[File:Arching Flight.jpg|thumb|Shows the simplified arching flight path of a ball]]
The arching flight path is a bit more realistic for most flying objects than the linear flight because it takes gravity into account. Remember that gravity is an acceleration. To calculate the position of a projectile with &lt;b&gt;constant&lt;/b&gt; acceleration and at a certain point in time the formula is:&lt;br&gt; &lt;math&gt;pos =\frac{1}{2} {a}{t}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;  ,where ''a'' is the acceleration and ''t'' the time that has passed&lt;br&gt;
Because gravity pulls the projectile towards earth only the y-coordinate of your projectile will be effected. The projectile's ascenting rate will decrease over time until it stops its climb and turns to fall. However, the x and z coordinates remain uneffected by this and are calculated just the way they are with the linear flight path.
The following formula shows how to compute the y-position: &lt;br&gt; 
&lt;math&gt;{pos_y}= ({pos_y} + {velocity_y}\times{timePassed}) - \frac{1}{2} \times{gravity}\times{totalTimePassed}^{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt; , where ''totalTimePassed'' is the time passed since the projectiles started&lt;br&gt;
The minuend is equal to the linear flight formula, the subtrahend is the downwards acceleration due to gravity. It becomes obvious that the lower the projectile's speed and the further the velocity's direction is pointed towards the ground, the faster gravity will win over. This function will update the projectile's flight path:

&lt;source lang=csharp&gt;
private void ArchingFlight(GameTime timePassed){
    prevPos = pos; 
    // accumulate overall time
    totalTimePassed += (float)timePassed.ElapsedGameTime.Milliseconds/4096.0f ;
    
    // flight path where y-coordinate is additionally effected by gravity
    pos = pos + velocity * ((float)timePassed.ElapsedGameTime.Milliseconds/90.0f);
    pos.Y = pos.Y - 0.5f * GRAVITY * totalTimePassed * totalTimePassed;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

I scaled the time that is added to the overall time down again so the gravity does not take immediate effect. For a speed of 1 scaling by 4096 produces a nice flying path. Also, the compiler hopefully does something sensible and optimises the division by 4096 because it is a multiple of two. You might want to play around with the scaling factors. If your game is not set on earth you should also think about if the gravity constant is different.
&lt;/br&gt;
== Impact ==
Once your projectile is on the move you might want to do some collision checking if you expect it to hit anything. For more information and details on how to do collision detection check out the chapter about [[#Collision Detection|Collision Detection]].
In case a collision is detected it is time to think about what is going to happen to the projectile and the object that was hit. What the impact will look like is highly dependent on what your projectile is. A ball can bounce back, a really fast and small bullet might penetrate the object and keep on moving, a big torpedo on the other hand would probably explode. It is easier to decide in the hit object's class what the appropriate reaction will be when hit and maybe play specified sounds or animation. Otherwise you have to keep track in the projectile class of all effects that the projectile can have on each object in the game.
To keep things simple just include some functions in your projectile class that define a possible behaviour of your the projectile and call the appropriate one from the hit object class when you detect a collision. For example, when a ball hits the ground it would probably simply bounce of. To simulate this behaviour use the following function in your projectile class and call it when you detect the ball reaching the ground. All it does is reflect the incoming direction and reduce the speed. When the speed is zero or smaller the ball has stopped moving and there is no need to keep its flight path updated. The 'reflectionAxis' Vector contains only ones except for the axis along which the direction needs to be inversed, this value will have to be a -1. 

&lt;source lang= csharp&gt;
public void bounce(Vector3 incomingDirection, Vector3 reflectionAxis){
    //reflect the incoming projectile and normalize it so it's &quot;just&quot; a direction
    Vector3 direction = Vector3.Normalize(reflectionAxis* incomingDirection);
    speed -= 0.5f;                   // reduces the speed so the arche becomes lower
    velocity = speed * direction;    // the new velocity vector
    totalTimePassed= 0;                     // gravity starts all over again
    if (speed &lt;= 0)bmoving= false;   // no speed no movement
}
&lt;/source&gt;

A call to this function could look something like this when the ball is supposed to bounce back from the ground, hence its y-direction needs to be inversed:
&lt;source lang= csharp&gt;
ball.bounce(ball.position - ball.previousPosition, new Vector3(1, -1, 1));
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;

= Reusable Components =

== Overview ==
There are many components out there that could be easily used in other games. An example is a 3D Radar Heads Up Display [[http://forums.create.msdn.com/forums/t/12135.aspx 3D Radar HUD]]. In this chapter we want to show some of the most common ones, and especially show links where to find lots of these components. Afterwards we are going to say some words about how to create your own game component using XNA Framework that can be later reused.

== Examples ==
=== Game State Management ===

The [http://create.msdn.com/en-US/education/catalog/sample/game_state_management Game State Management example] represents the menu system of the game and reacts on the user input by switching the screens. The starting point is the main menu with three entries: ''Play'', ''Options'' and ''Exit''. 

In this example, there are several instances of the class &lt;code&gt;GameScreen&lt;/code&gt; that are managed by the &lt;code&gt;ScreenManager&lt;/code&gt; class. The &lt;code&gt;GameScreen&lt;/code&gt; is an abstract class and with its ''Update'', ''HandleInput'' and ''Draw'' methods creates a base for all other screens that are used in the menu system. The other classes representing different screens extend the &lt;code&gt;GameScreen&lt;/code&gt; class. The actual gameplay is also a screen and must be set in the class &lt;code&gt;GameplayScreen&lt;/code&gt;.

The &lt;code&gt;MenuEntry&lt;/code&gt; is a helper class and is used to create a single entry of the menu (class &lt;code&gt;MenuScreen&lt;/code&gt;) which sends an event &lt;code&gt;OnSelectEntry&lt;/code&gt; when being selected. In this example the menu entry is just a string, but you can modify the representation according to your game design. An object of the &lt;code&gt;MenuScreen&lt;/code&gt; class will have a collection of the menu entries and an index of the currently selected entry.

There is an instance of the &lt;code&gt;ScreenManager&lt;/code&gt; class in the &lt;code&gt;Game&lt;/code&gt; class created and two screens are added: the first one for the background and the second one for the main menu.

You can also find some another examples of the main menu in the ''Links'' chapter below, including the similar solution for multiplayer networked game containing menus to maintain the sessions and the error handling.

=== Heads Up Display (HUD) ===
==== Score, Life, Health Bar ... ====

Each game contain several elements that help the player to keep track on the progress. For example, if you got some bonuses, they will be shown on the screen. There other examples could be the health bar, the number of lifes and the score counter. All of them are the common part of a game and can be implemented using the game components.

There is a reusable library [http://moltione.codeplex.com XNA Re-usable UI Components] that provides these components. It consists of four classes:
* &lt;code&gt;Bar&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Counter&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;Timer&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;GenericComponent&lt;/code&gt;

To be able to use the components, download the library, unzip the .dll file and add it to your project as a reference. Now you can create an object of the class you need and set the property values. These are, for example, bar position, score value, etc. In the ''Draw'' method of the class &lt;code&gt;Game&lt;/code&gt; you can now add a call to the instance ''Draw'' method.

The library also provides event handling: if minimum or maximum value is reached, an event will be sent. These events can be overriden, so you can decide what should happen if the player has no lives or no fuel anymore.

The detailed documentation for the library can be found [http://www.neil.copperstream.co.uk/xna/NeilsGameComponents/annotated.html here].

==== 3D Radar ====
[http://forums.create.msdn.com/forums/t/12135.aspx 3D Radar HUD] is an another example of the HUD that shows how to integrate a 3D Radar into the 3D game using 2D Heads Up Display.



== Creating a reusable component ==
OK, we have learned that it is often a very good idea to create a game component if you are writing something that you will probably need in your next project. Now let's talk about how to do it. XNA Framework provides some classes for this purpose and using them you will be able to make a new game component that you can later reuse and/or share.

To do it, create a class that extends either the &lt;code&gt;Microsoft.Xna.Framework.GameComponent&lt;/code&gt; or the &lt;code&gt;Microsoft.Xna.Framework.DrawableGameComponent&lt;/code&gt; class. In the class constructor you have to pass a reference to the &lt;code&gt;Game&lt;/code&gt; instance as a parameter.

You should derive you class from the &lt;code&gt;GameComponent&lt;/code&gt; class if it contains functions working with user input, for example, react on pressing a specific key. In this case there will be two methods to override:
* ''Initialize''
* ''Update''

The &lt;code&gt;DrawableGameComponent&lt;/code&gt; class should be used if there are some content to be drawn on the screen. It extends the previous one and have some more methods, including:
* ''LoadContent''
* ''UnLoadContent''
* ''Draw''

There are some tutorials here that you may want to review in order to learn more about creating game components and to find some examples:

      <text xml:space="preserve">===What are Level Editors===
In general a Level Editor is a piece of software, we can use to create or design levels, games, maps etc..
I will show you two pieces of software which can be used to create a Level, one calls GLEED2D and the second is SAYA-Engine 0.3.

====Description====

XNA LED is a C# level editor created with XNA using xWinForms and outputs an XML file which is possible to load into your project using the Scene.cs class included in the source. 

====These are the current features implemented====
* Snapping
* Dynamic loading of textures during runtime
* Transformations like move, rotation, and scale
* Panning the screen
* Floating toolbox
* Uses xWinForms for GUI
* Save and load from an XML file
* Add Scene.cs class to your game for easy loading of levels
* Just port Scene.cs to any language to be able to use the XML files in that language

; Attributes Editor
: Create a tab on the right that lets you control various properties of each object. 
; Copy, Paste, Redo, Undo
: Full copy, paste, redo, and undo support!
; Show the snapping grid
; List of all objects in the scene
: Scenegraphs, easy renaming of objects.
; Pressing f to pan the camera to an object
; 2D Terrain editing/painting
; 2.5D models
: Place models, create 2.5d games! Start for 3d editing.
;3D Editing

: Editing.... in 3d! In 3D  editor, it is possible to create 2D or 3D scenes in the editor. For 3D
: we are able to import 3D models.
; Entity Editor, placing entities in the Level Editor
: For Entity editor you create a entity, a class, you define physics, shapes, mount, points,                : animation properties. 
: Also, we might add material editing, the texture that let you define all kind of maps, 
: and include  perfect synchronization.

===To create a Levels you can use the software GLEED2D - Generic Level Editor 2D===
Project Description
[[File:Level Editor.jpg|thumb|Level Editor]]
GLEED2D (Generic Level Editor 2D) is a software and is free, written in C# and XNA Game Studio 3.1.
It is a Level Editor for 2D games and is possible to insert textures and items. The Levels are saved in XML format.
Now we can added the special items, you own ideas of  some features.

===Examples for Features===
* undo/ redo
* parallax scrolling 
* placing &amp; editing textures
* multiple layers
* preview in your application 
* several tools 

====To make a XNA Level Editor====
[[File:Level 1.jpg|thumb|Level 1]] 
It is easy to work with this software, you can  create            
easy levels and very fast.
The structure of the levels is that each level consist several 
layers and each layer consist several items.
First I create a layer, on the layer I add the the texture and 
create a primitives for example a circle.
I continue to create more layer and give them a name,
add some texture on it until I am fine with my result. 
It is possible to rename the layer anytime. 
When I select the texture I can do three basic transformation, 
it is move rotation and scale. There are also other properties, 
the Tintcolour, FlipHorizontally and FlipVertically. 
Every action I can Undo and Redu, copy and paste. 
Finally you can save the level in XML file and we can look in XML file.



==Another Software is SAYA-Engine 0.3, you can use for 3D Games in XNA==

Saja Engine 0.3 is a also a software and is free, with this software you can design levels in 2 D and 3 D. Is very easy to work, you can create very fast your levels.

Youtube.com has a lot of tutorials with Saya- Engine, In this website http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NczP1pQev5Q&amp;feature=related you can see how easy is to create a level with this software.

[[File:Saja 03.jpg|thumb|Saja 03]]

When I start to create a level, I add some texture on it. For example the floor will be green, then I put some stones, windows and whatever I like. There is a lot of examples for the texture in Internet, for background and objects. 

[[File:Saya.Level.jpg|thumb|Saya.Level]]

Here are some important points in general about level editors

* Modify level content processor to load textures automatically, so that they don’t need to be added manually
* Implement a camera system to be able to create larger levels and move around them
* Add functionality to the level editor to be able to edit objects once they have been placed
* Implement the Properties tab using the .NET Property Grid control to be able to edit the properties of selected objects

== The Future of Robots ==

In today’s world, technology that is used for robots is ever changing and becoming better.  In the past, robots were merely a dream, a “what if” in what the future might hold in terms of technology.  Each and every day, advances are being made that are making that dream ever so close to becoming a reality. Humans become more experienced because they never want to be confined by the restrictions that are placed upon them, always refusing to obey the limits of limitations.  If one tells a person that he or she cannot do something, then he or she will strive to surpass what others think cannot be done. With planes, helicopters, and other aerial inventions, people have escaped the confines of being restricted to the ground. With rocket ships, humans have shown that they can even escape the confines of the planet, leaving it entirely to a point where they are so high they can look down upon their home world, achieving something that so few can. This type of movement in technology is what pushes the mind to want to create something more because if we can achieve something like space travel, we can do so much more.

There are several robots that already exist in this world today; there are ones that are used for cleaning, some that can dance, and ones that can attach to someone almost like a suit of armor. The Roomba is a robot that is small and circular in size and is designed to clean the floors of a house just like a vacuum. Built by a company called iRobot, the Roomba is made to automatically move around the house, sucking up dirt and grime off of floors and carpets, from edges and corners.  It is also made not to get tangled up in chair legs or tables. There are robots, like the Toyota trumpet-playing robot, that can imitate the movement of human lips to the point that they can play songs on actual instruments, like trumpets.

With such advancements made each and every day, the future of robotics is heading in the direction of building full humanoid-like robots with human skeletal and muscular systems. Scientists are also working on building robots with using neural networks, which are modeled after a human’s nervous system.  This allows a robot to have a “brain” that allows them to learn as they go on with their tasks.  If a robot runs into a desk, for example, because of its neural network, a robot will know not to move in that same direction again to avoid running into the desk again.  This is something that scientists are trying to implement intro android designs, but it is something that is proving difficult.  One problem is trying to get androids to move around on two legs like humans can because robots on legs are more difficult to get moving than robots on wheels; they have to “learn” to balance themselves.  With the rapid pace at which technology is growing, scientists will soon find a way to make these robots more like us.

== Programming Concepts ==
	
Robot programming includes the coded commands which tell the robot when to move, where to go, how fast to move, as well as many other things.  A written program is made up of the instructions that manipulate a robot's actions, and it supplies information concerning necessary tasks.  A user program is composed of a series of instructions that describe the desired behavior.  Programming robots can be a complicated and challenging process.  Since people are now trying to create robots that will save money and better facilitate others to make certain jobs easier, creating user-friendly and unchallenging programming languages is essential.

Robot programming is used to manipulate physical objects in the real world, while representing some data in a model not necessarily part of the real world.  Commands based on some model are causing robots to alter the conditions of the real world as well as the world model itself.  One of the most important concepts in programming a robot is to move the robot the same way a human might move; a robot should be able to move in all directions.  An advanced robotics programming concept is the use of sensors, such as touch, ultrasonic, or light sensors that allow a robot to interact with the real world around it.  Because of these, many robots today have monitors containing built-in programs to communicate with the robot control system and other applications.  Monitors can read a specific sensor to then modify the robot’s actions, such as having a robot move in a particular path or to avoid a person that is walking toward the robot.
	
In an embedded system, the operating system is often called firmware, or software for an embedded system stored in nonvolatile flash memory that provides control over the hardware of the embedded system.  This allows a user to write a program that can be compiled directly on a robot as a compact file, known as bytecode, suitable for execution.  Bytecode cannot be executed directly; instead, the operating system contains an application that looks at each bytecode and converts it to the appropriate functionality.  Based on movement and sensors, robots can now also use cognition to plan its next move.  Based on the coding of a program, a robot can “see” what is coming next and can execute a line or lines of code based on what is going on around the robot.  If the robot feels that it just ran into a chair, say, the robot can then plan to back up and move to go around the chair.  These concepts are what make a robot act as humans would in the real world.



== Robot Control ==

Robot control is the study of controlling robots. Robot control refers to the way that the robot senses and takes action and how the sensors and other parts of the robot work together efficiently. There are many program controls with robots, an almost infinite number of possibilities, and they are limited to a specific number of boundaries when it comes to actual control. There are four basic ways of controlling a robot that are being used today: deliberative control, reactive control, hybrid control, and behavior-based control. For deliberative control, the robot thinks hard first and then acts. With reactive control, a robot does not think, but it just reacts instead.  A robot thinks and acts independently in parallel with hybrid control.  Finally, for behavior-based control, a robot thinks the way it acts. 

These points are explained because each and every robot has its own strengths and weaknesses, so there is no one single approach that is best for controlling robots. There are some trade offs when it comes to controlling robots. The thinking can be slow, but the reaction must be fast. Thinking allows the privilege of being able to look ahead and plan ahead so that any bad actions can be avoided. There is a drawback to thinking, however; because thinking too long can be dangerous because of the fact that it could put the robot in a dangerous situation since it is preoccupied with thinking and not watching out for its surroundings, something like getting run over or falling off a cliff could happen. 

It is because of these tradeoffs that robots act differently from each other. Some are made to think little and act little, while others do not even think at all. These types of decisions are thought of when deciding what purpose the robot will have and the kind of environment it will be placed in. If the purpose of the robot is to react and move quickly, then there will be almost no time at all for thinking, and, in turn, it will not be programmed to think in that manner.  Two examples of robots that have to react and move quickly are soccer playing robots and car robots. The soccer playing robot has to move and react quickly because it has to be able to move around its environment quickly in order to get the ball and try to score a goal. The car robot has to move and react quickly because it needs to be able to move at a certain speed and react quickly in order not to hit anything that may enter in its pathway.

On the other hand, robots that are in an environment where it is not always changing have the time and luxury of being able to think and plan ahead. Examples of these types of robots are robots that are made to play chess, robots that can build objects, and robots that are given the task of watching a warehouse.  The chess playing robot, for example, needs to be able to think and plan ahead because chess is a mind game, and to think and react quickly without taking into consideration every possible detail would result in a quick failure on the robot's part.



== Robot Hardware ==
Since robots are meant to be as human-like as possible, just as humans need their body and heart to function, robots need some sort of hardware.  The hardware of a robot is anything physical used to help the robot operate in a certain way.  The hardware needed to build a robot is diverse.  It depends on what type of robot one is building. If the robot is an automated factory worker the hardware could involve all sorts of sophisticated and heavy industry tools.  If, on the other hand, one is working to build a humanoid or space exploration robot, the hardware can be muscle wire or sensitive lenses, for example.

Robots use many different types of hardware to allow the robots to function in a specific way.  Hardware is what allows a robot to move in a certain way.  Robots use motors in order to move.  Some may only have one motor which allows them to move forward and backward only at a particular speed.  Robots with more than one motor have the added capability to make turns as well.  By allowing one motor to move quicker than another one, the robot can make a turn in the direction of the slower-moving motor.  A programmer can program the motors to move at different speeds, which allows the robot more capacity for work.
	
Robots also have driving mechanisms, which include gears, chains, pulleys, belts, and gearboxes.  The central purpose of the gears and chains is to pass on the rotary movement from one place to another; during this process, there is also a possibility to change the speed or the direction of the movement.  These driving mechanisms can help the robot transfer pressure from one place to another on the robot to keep the weight of the robot uniform.  They can also help the motors move smoothly.  While pulleys and belts also have the same function as gears and chains, pulleys have shapes like wheels that have grooves around their edges.

In order to build a more intelligent robot, one also can install sensors to give a robot more life.  For example, a robot can have a touch sensor that, when programmed, may allow a robot to back away when it runs into an object.  Robots can also use sound sensors to play sounds as well as to hear sounds and respond to them appropriately.  Light sensors allow robots to perform some action or task when they enter a space that has a certain amount of light.  A simple example of this is programming a robot to follow a line; by sensing the darkness of a line, the robot can follow it without straying from the path.  Robots can also use ultrasonic sensors to sense an object or a person in front of it without having to actually touch or run into it.  This may be helpful with especially fragile robots; being able to avoid touching objects may keep pressure off of delicate areas in the build.

Robots also need some sort of a power supply.  In a Lego Mindstorms NXT robot, the power supply is the brick.  It holds the batteries as well as all the ports in order to plug in motors and sensors.  Without the brick, a robot would not be able to move or function in any way.  The brick is the main source of the energy for the robot.

Robots can also be used along with cameras.  Attaching a camera or a microphone to a robot can allow a person to move the robot and see where it is going or hear what it going on in the surrounding areas.  These extra hardware packages can make the robot smarter and more creative.

== Mathematics of Robot Control ==

The mathematics of robot control is what goes on in the brick of a robot that allows it to move and function. A term that is commonly used when talking about the mathematics of controlling a robot is kinematics. Kinematics is the mechanics that describe the motion of objects and systems and when it relates to robots; it is what allows the robot to move. Kinematics is a system of bodies that are linked together by mechanical joints, and the system allows for an object to conduct motion. One example is a crane; kinematics allows a crane to move up and down and open and close in order to scoop up or grab hold of objects.

The fact that this is the mathematics of robot control means that there is science involved that explains how a robot is able to move using the joints or mechanics inside of it and what program or code gives it the power to move. In kinematics, the position of a point is an absolute key when it comes to movement. In order to identify what the position of a point is, one has to identify three other things first: the origin, which is also called the reference point; the difference, or how far away the robot is, from the origin; and the direction of the reference point.

In mathematics for robotics, there is also forward and inverse kinematics. To start, forward kinematics also goes by the name “direct kinematics,” and in forward kinematics, the only things that are given are the angle of each joint and the length of each link. What one has to calculate is the position of any point in the robot’s work volume. When it comes to inverse kinematics, one does the opposite; one is given the length of each joint and the position of the point in work volume, and one has to calculate the angle of each joint.

== Robot Programming Languages ==
	
In order to program a robot, many languages are available to use.  It depends on the knowledge of the programmer.  Many different robot kits or models may work best with certain programming languages, depending on the difficulty of the program and the build of the robot.  Depending on whether a person has knowledge of C, C++, Java, or something else, certain programs may be easier to pick up.
	
ROBOTC is a program based on the C language, and it is very compatible, especially with NXT robots.  It was created by the Robotics Academy at Carnegie Mellon University.  ROBOTC is very easy to learn, and it can be used for easy programs as well as more complex programs.  The programming language contains a debugger that allows programmers to see where their programming mistakes are; this allows for easy editing.  ROBOTC allows a programmer to specify motors, timers, sensors, and variables.
	
Similar to ROBOTC, Not Exactly C, or NXC, is also a C-based program.  NXC programs use the Bricx development environment, which was initially developed for LEGO’s earlier RCX robotics product and has been enhanced to support the NXT.  NXC uses the same firmware as NXT-G, the basic graphical user interface used with LEGO Mindstorms robot kits.  This allows programmers to use a graphical environment and a text environment without having to change the firmware that is loaded on the brick of a robot.  A person can store both NXT-G and NXC programs simultaneously in the same brick.  NXC allows integer variables; however, floating-point variables create problems.
	
Another programming language that is compatible with NXT is ROBOLAB, which is more of a graphical representation of the program, rather than lined text.  Developed at Tufts University, ROBOLAB was originally used for the first generation LEGO Mindstorms RCX microprocessor “brick.”  Like the NXC language, it was expansively improved and modified to function with both the RCX and the second-generation NXT.  This program is useful usually only if you are comfortable with the ROBOLAB platform.  If a programmer is unfamiliar with how it works, there are much easier languages a programmer could choose to utilize.
	
Lejos is a Java- based program, so if a person is more familiar with Java than with C, Lejos is a good language to use with robots.  Just like any other programming language, Lejos programs are written and compiled on a PC.  The compiled programs are then transported to the NXT to be executed.
	
Pblua is also programming language used for robots.  Lua is a relatively new text-based language.  It allows a person to virtually do anything that he or she can do with ROBOTC or NXC; it is just a different programming language that one can learn to broaden their robotics programming language knowledge.



== Obstacle Avoidance ==

Obstacle avoidance is a type of robotic training that allows robots the task of moving on the foundation of the information that is provided by its senses. These methods are used as a different and natural option when the situation is unpredictable with unknowing behavior, or the scenario is dynamic. In these types of situations, the surroundings of a robot may be always shifting and, because of this, the information that the sensor receives can be used to discover the changes that have been made so the robot can continue to adapt and move.

Some of the research that has been done on the subject has identified two major problems with this training. One of them is two vehicles that were placed in troublesome events; there, it showed that the technology being used had limited ability for being suited to the matter at hand. The other reason for the major problems was the robot understanding the role of the characteristic of the vehicle within the obstacle avoidance pattern. The characteristics were dynamics, shape, and kinematics.   

Most of the techniques that have to do with obstacle avoidance do not take in the fact that the kinematic and shape constraints that the vehicle has. The ones working on the vehicle may assume that the vehicle has infinite directional abilities and are doomed when they discover the vehicle cannot do everything that they thought it could. One contribution is a framework that is able to consider both the shape and kinematics together. This obstacle avoidance process is done by abstracting the constraints from the avoidance method.

== Task Planning and Navigation ==

Task planning, which is being able to achieve a goal by performing certain smaller tasks to reach the ultimate goal, involves learning the spatial requirements for a robot to perform basic operations, such as navigation, efficiently and properly.  Because of requirements of robot-environments in the real work force, task planning in robotics should be executed efficiently.

For a robot to plan for a task appropriately, mobile robots usually rely exclusively on spatial information, which it can learn through synchronization of the sensors to obtain and understand information from the outside surroundings, and on trivial domain knowledge, like labels attached to objects and places.  Some robots may have information stored about configured space to determine an appropriate path across the configured space that it is knowledgeable about so that it can navigate around barriers.  Some robots depend on sensors or programmed rules within the code of the robot in order to pick a suitable route to take when moving.  There are also neural network systems that allow a robot to learn as it goes by experimentation.  If the robot runs into an object which forces it to turn around, the robot will know, from now on, that it should not go that way again to avoid the particular obstacle.  Also, there are some algorithms that can derive a path for robots to take to maximize the distance from a specific obstacle.

In order for robots to successfully perform task planning and navigation, the robot must have organized communication between all of its parts, such as the sensors.  Every component of a robot significantly influences the performance.  A robot needs to be able to function without collisions as well as knowing what safe conditions are necessary; this includes making sure the robot does not encounter unsafe temperatures or lights, for example.

For a robot to navigate safely, the robot must become aware of itself in reference to some location.  Being able to avoid running into harmful objects or falling down stairs is crucial to the success of a robot in its task planning.  A program for a robot should include this in the code, whether it is using sensors to become aware of the world or neural networks.  Based on this information, a robot can then plan accordingly in terms of its speed or its turning in different directions.  A robot should also be able to create a continuous motion during its task in order to achieve the goal smoothly.



== Robot Vision ==

The field of robot vision guidance is a field that is developing at a very fast pace. With the benefits of high level and degree technology, it gives savings, reliability, productivity, and safety. Both identification and navigation are used when it comes to robot vision.  Vision applications are generally made for finding a part and positioning it for inspection or robotic handling before another application is performed. There are times when multiple mechanical tools can be replaced with single robot stations by a vision guided robot. 

When a robot needs the vision ability, it takes the combination of calibration, temperature, software, cameras, and algorithms for it to work. The calibration of the systems for robot vision is dependent on application. Those applications can range from simple guidance applications to applications that are more complex that need the data from more than one sensor to work.  Algorithms are things that are always improving and allow for more high level and more complex detection. There are robots that now have collision detection, which is something that tells the system when the robot is about to hit something. This ability allows the robots to work along with robots in areas with obstacles and not have the fear of having a major collision. The robot would stop moving for a bit when it detects another object in its way that is restricting its movement. 

Robot vision simplifies processes making them more straightforward, and, in turn, that cuts costs. Fixturing and hard tooling are both eliminated when robot vision is uses. The products can be identified and the applications can be performed without the need for securing. There are savings in the machinery and labor department. There is no need for labor because the robot now handles its own loading of parts.

There are steps one can take when trying to decide on the right type of robot guidance system.  One should work with an integrator and keep some things in mind. One must make sure that the robot vision is able to connect with the robot system and the applications for it. If something were to disconnect, then that could harm the robot or the product and could cause a loss in quality and production. One must also make sure that the environment that the robot is in is a controlled one so that the robot vision remains aware and sharp.  Finally, one must consider all of the elements in the environment, like the lighting, the chemicals in the air, and the color changes, as they can affect what a robot sees in its vision.

== Knowledge Based Vision Systems ==

A vision system is used in robotics to organize programs to process images and to recognize objects.  In order for this to work properly and to allow a robot system to perform at a desired level in its environment, a vision system should adjust to numerous working circumstances by altering and correcting the limitations that manage the system’s several processing phases.  A knowledge based vision system must decide which vision modules to connect together, and it must be the power source of image acquisition.  Knowledge-based vision systems that analyze knowledge that is given explicitly can be used for this task.
	
For knowledge based vision system, one must give the robot the parameters of the object, such as the curves or corners of a specific object.  From this information, the robot can produce certain controllers.  Based on what the robot was given as well as what it computes on its own, the knowledge based vision system can create a model showing the objects, which can be revised by the user.
	
A knowledge based vision system is responsible for tuning parameters that it comes across, obtaining images through changing shutter speeds of a camera or adjusting the light settings possibly, and observing the system’s configuration to make changes if necessary.  A knowledge based vision system may encounter different types of input data, so it must be able to adjust accordingly to changes it may come across while running.  Through its blueprint, a knowledge-based vision system has the capability to recognize new information about the surroundings in the world and alter its actions consequently.

Knowledge based vision systems, however, can be expensive to use.  Having to collect knowledge, such as images, can be money- and time-consuming.  Knowledge based visions systems still should be researched and altered to work better in dynamic worldly situations.

== Robots and Artificial Intelligence ==

Artificial Intelligence is one of the fields in robotics that harbors the most excitement. When it comes to controversy in the field of robotics, AI is always at the top of the list. While everyone can agree that a robot is capable enough to work on an assembly line, not everyone can agree that a robot can be intelligent on its own. Artificial Intelligence is as hard a term to define as robot. An Ultimate AI would be a man-made machine that has human beings’ intellectual abilities; it would be a recreation of the human thought process. With these abilities, the robot would be able to learn almost anything; it would be able to create its own ideas, learn how to use human language, and reason. Right now, the area of robotics is nowhere near this level of Artificial Intelligence, but it has been making progress in areas of limited AI. 

Computers are already able to solve problems to some degree, as the basic idea of Artificial Intelligence problem solving is very simple. It is the execution that is the complicated part. First the computer, or robot, has to gather the facts of a situation through what a human tells it or through its own sensors. The computer then compares the information to stored data and then decides what the information means. The computer then runs through different types of actions that it could take and decides which action is best suited based on the information that it gathered. It is only capable of solving the problem that it is given and does not have any analytical ability.

The real challenge when it comes to Artificial Intelligence is trying to understand how natural intelligence works. Since scientists do not have a solid model to work from, developing an A.I is not like building an artificial heart. Scientists know that the brain contains billions of neurons and that it’s the electrical connection between the different neurons that allow people to think and learn. What they don’t know is how the connections add up to having higher reasoning or even operations of the low level, and it is this complex circuitry that is difficult to understand.

__FORCETOC__

= Camera =
== Introduction ==
A camera is a very important component in a 3D world, because it represents the viewpoint of the user. At the beginning, two elementary things, the position and the looking direction of the camera must be defined, before XNA can render the content into your 3D world.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== Basics ==
=== Coordinate Systems ===
You need to keep in mind that different graphic systems use different axis systems. XNA uses the right-handed system. X for right, Y for up and Z out of the screen. The conversion of one into another system is done by inverting any, but only one axis.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
=== Degrees and Radians ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Degrees !! PI 
|-
| 45 degrees || 1/4 PI
|-
| 90 degrees || 1/2 PI
|-
| 180 degrees || PI
|-
| 270 degrees || 3/2 PI
|-
| 360 degrees || 2 PI
|}

The math helper functions ''MathHelper.ToDegree(radians)'' and ''MathHelper.ToRadians(degrees)'' can help you by the conversion.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
=== Matrices and Spaces ===
Before any 3D geometry can be rendered, there must be 3 matrices set.

* World Matrix [[File:Model-to-world space.png|thumb|2D Transformation from Object/Model Space into the World Space]]
:Your model from Maya, 3ds Max, etc. consists of a bunch of vertex positions which are in relationship with the center of this object. To use this data, you need to convert it from the so called Object/Model Space into an object in World Space using the World Matrix.

:&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;Matrix worldTranslation=Matrix.CreateTranslation(new Vector3(x,y,z));&lt;/source&gt;

:With this function you create a matrix that transforms the position of the object into World Space by using a vector. After the transformation you can scale, rotate and translate your object. But remember that matrix multiplication is not commutative, you need to do this always in the ''S-R-T'' order in XNA.

* View Matrix [[File:World view space.png|thumb|2D Transformation from World Space to View Space]]
:To watch your world from a certain point, the world must be transformed from its space into the View Space by using the View Matrix.

* Projection Matrix
:The viewed 3D Data which is actually seen, called view frustum, must be converted onto your 2D screen. The View Space must be transformed into the Screen Space by using the Projection Matrix.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== Camera Set Up ==
If you want to visualize your 3D content for the user on a 2D Screen, you need to get a camera to work. You do this by using the above mentioned View and Projection Matrix which transforms the data for your needs.

=== The View Matrix ===
It saves the position and the looking direction of the camera – for this you have to set the Position, Target and Up vectors of your camera. You do this by using the ''Matrix.CreateLookAt'' method:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;viewMatrix = Matrix.CreateLookAt(camPosition, camTarget, camUpVector);&lt;/source&gt;

The three arguments are vectors.
* The position vector is very simple to explain: It displays the position where your camera is located in your 3D world.

* The target vector is very simple to explain too: It displays the point where your camera is looking at in your 3D world.

* The up vector is important. Imagine that you hold a cell phone in your hands which is your camera. Automatically you got a position vector for it. The next step is to focus the target you want to photograph. Now you got concrete values for the position and the target vector, but there are still many ways to hold your cell phone by rotating it to its center. The position and target vectors stay the same but the picture you can take varies because of the rotation. This is the point why you need to declare which way is up. Only if these three vectors are set, you got an exclusive camera.
&lt;br /&gt;
The whole code for this can look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;Matrix viewMatrix;
Vector3 camPosition = new Vector3(x,y,z);
Vector3 camTarget = new Vector3(x,y,z);
Vector3 camUpVector = new Vector3(x,y,z);

viewMatrix = Matrix.CreateLookAt(camPostion, camTarget, camUpVector);&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
=== The Projection Matrix ===
It saves the view frustum, everything from the 3D World that is seen through your camera and should be rendered on your 2D screen.
Take your camera as a point. Now create two rectangles/layers, a near one which is small and a far one which is bigger. Draw a line that starts at the camera point and connects each upper right corner of the rectangles/layers, after that do the same for the other three corners of both rectangles/layers. If you do this you get a pyramid which cone end is the camera point and the bottom is the bigger rectangle/layer. Everything between this is called ''Viewing volume''. The space between the near and the far plane is called ''Frustum''. All details in this ''View Frustum'' are going to be rendered on your 2D screen.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The method to create a Projection Matrix is called ''Matrix.CreatePerspectiveFieldOfView'' and should look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;projectionMatrix=Matrix.CreatePerspectiveFieldOfView(fieldOfView, aspectRatio, nearPlaneDistance, farPlaneDistance);&lt;/source&gt;

* fieldOfView specifies the field of view in y-direction (radian measure)
* aspectRatio is the relationship between View Space Width divided by View Space Height. The aspect ratio of the 2D screen which consist of the rendered 3D world.
* nearPlaneDistance is the distance between camera and near plane
* farPlaneDistance is the distance between camera and far plane
&lt;br /&gt;
The near and far Planes are called clipping planes as well. Keep in mind that big objects in the front could block nearly the most of the 3D world behind, so with this plane they are clipped away. The same applies for very small objects in the far, maybe they are almost unseen, but they need to be rendered. If you want to save resources, clip them.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

=== Notes ===
* The World Matrix calculates every data and their position you would like to render.
* The View Matrix will be calculated every time if there are changes in the position or direction depending on user input
* The Projection Matrix is only calculated when the aspect ratio of the window changes. So this is normally at the start of your game.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
= Lighting =
== Introduction ==
It seems to be pretty easy to light your scene. Attach your 3D objects in your world, use your set of matrices which are mentioned above, bring your lights into by defining their positions, and everything is done. But it isn’t that facile and without a correct set lighting your 3D scene won’t look very realistic.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
== Normals ==
Every 3D objects consists of triangles and these triangles must be lit correctly. To do this you need to specify a normal vector to each of it. Remember to set this accurate; a normal vector shout point out of an object, if it points into it, it won’t be lit right.
With the information of the light direction and the normal direction the graphic card can compute how much light needs to be “drawn” onto the triangles surface. If the light direction and the normal direction is perpendicular there is nothing to lit, the projection is 0. If the two vectors are parallel, the projection is max; the surface will be lit with full intensity.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now you need an instance of the ''VertexPositionColorTexture'' class which should look like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;dataVertices[0] =  new VertexPositionNormalTexture(new Vector3(x,y,z), new Vector3(x,y,z), new Vector2(x,y));&lt;/source&gt;

*one Vector3 for the xyz position
*one Vector3 for the xyz surface normal
*one Vector2 for the uv texture coordinates
&lt;br /&gt;
== BasicEffect ==
If you want to use basic light effects, you can use the ''BasicEffect'' class from XNA. With this you can set up quickly your 3D world with lightning. The code for this can look like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;BasicEffect basicEffect;
basicEffect = new BasicEffect(GraphicsDevice, null);&lt;/source&gt;
Set the variable and instantiate it
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;basicEffect.World = worldMatrix;
basicEffect.View = viewMatrix;
basicEffect.Projection = projectionMatrix;
basicEffect.TextureEnabled = true;&lt;/source&gt;
Set the World, View and Projection matrices which are mentioned above. If you use textures you need to enable them.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;basicEffect.LightingEnabled = true;
basicEffect.AmbientLightColor = new Vector3(0.1f, 0.1f, 0.1f); ;&lt;/source&gt;
Enable the lightning settings and define a ''Ambient color'' so your objects are always lit with light.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;basicEffect.DirectionalLight0.Direction = new Vector3(x,y,z);
basicEffect.DirectionalLight0.DiffuseColor = new Vector3(0, 0, 0.5f);
basicEffect.DirectionalLight0.Enabled = true; 
…&lt;/source&gt;
You can define different light sources (up to three), set a direction and a color and enable them

&lt;br /&gt;
And finally ...
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;effect.Begin();
foreach (EffectPass pass in basicEffect.CurrentTechnique.Passes)
{
   pass.Begin();
   …
   pass.End();
}
effect.End();&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Primitive Objects ==
Points, lines, and triangles are the primitive objects of the graphics card.  Everything else is made up of one of these.  Hence, it is a good idea to start with understanding these, before continuing to delve into more advanced topics.

=== Creating a region from a list of shapes ===

The r command is used to create a region from a list of shapes. Note that the shapes must have been created in the database for the operations to work:

 # Create a region named region1.r that consists of a union
 # of the objects sph1.s and sph2.s
 r region1.r u sph1.s sph2.s

'''Intimate relationship skills''' are techniques which people can use to help in their long-term [[w:intimate relationship|intimate relationship]]s.

All relationships have difficulties; but the difference between those who succeed and those who don't is how they cope with those difficulties.
&lt;!--STYLE TOO MUCH LIKE HOWTO, TOO INSTRUCTIONAL:
 It is heartening that, for those wanting to succeed, the relationship skills below can be learnt.  -- ''Convenience link while redrafting'' -  &lt;sup&gt; [[User_talk:Geoffjw1978/Intimate_relationship_skills#ref3|(3)]]&lt;/sup&gt;
--&gt;

Use of these skills helps to restore intimacy in all its forms, strengthen relationships, intensify the emotional bonds of loved ones and enrich people's lives with hope for the future.

==History of intimate relationship skills==

===Pre-history===
It is safe to say that these relationship skills have a literary history since writing began.

A craftsman was in conflict with his apprentice and chose to write down his frustrations, berating the 
student's lack of diligence.

The written record shows the advice to the apprentice to stop visiting lots of houses, drinking beer in 
each house, spending all his time in the pursuit of pleasure and to put more effort into his work.

A fairly normal occurrence - except this was before 1350BC, and the writing was on papyrus in [[hieroglyphs]].

&lt;!-- Convenience link while redrafting - further verifiability and a quote from the citation here - see WP:VPP --&gt;  
&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geoffjw1978/Intimate_relationship_skills#ref30|(30)]]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Ancient===  
The Greek and Roman philosophers had much to say on intimate relationship skills, the institution of marriage was a bedrock of their society.  For example - [[Socrates]], [[Lucretius]], [[Marcus Aurelius]].
&lt;!-- Where are the citations? I'm sure these philosophers had a lot to say about this issue but references to specific works (which might be found in Wikisource) are needed here.-~~~~ --&gt;

===Present day===   
Research journals and a multitude of long-term studies report their new findings frequently. There is still much to learn and discover.  For a good history, see [[Intimate_relationship#2010s|intimate relationships]].

* Communication of needs

: Active listening is one technique which can be tried by couples who have identified a need for it. 
: Active listening can be useful but a feature to note is that happy couples rarely use active listening techniques in their day-to-day communication. 
: Active listening has been found to make the listener defensive and often turn away from the approach. Training is required to listen. 
: Essentially the technique is for the listener to acknowledge what the criticiser has said by repeating back a summary of the criticism. 
: This communication therapy is based on the assumption that conflicts occur because individuals have failed to truly understand what their partners say to them. 
: Active listening can foster improved communication skills by teaching the couple how to hear what they are saying to each other and how to respond to those statements in positive ways. Once a couple has learned to understand each other, they often find that they can resolve their differences and cooperate to find solutions to their marriage issues that meet their needs.

: '''The &quot;everydayness&quot; of marriage'''

: The happiest wives are those who focus on the quiet rewards that come from the everyday give-and-take of a relationship.

: Unhappy wives often have not learned the lesson of the &quot;everydayness of marriage&quot;.
: Unhappy wives recall an emotional story of the relationship over time, whereas happy wives take a more pragmatic stance. 
: In one study the happiest couples were not those who tried to live a never-ending romance or dwell on wonderful romantic times in their past. The happy couples in the study seemed to understand that meeting romantic myths is one thing, living a smooth-running life is another. 
: The happy wives in the study did not dwell on the past but were generally content with their day to day life together and spoke with hope and continued optimism toward the future. &lt;ref name=&quot;Thrice-Told Tales&quot;&gt;'''Thrice-Told Tales''', by Diane Holmberg, Terri L.

=== Follow [[best practices]] ===

Following the [[best practices]] for happy relationships encompasses keeping in mind the principles below as much as possible.

* '''Build trust''' - one principle which cuts down on lots of rules between those in the relationship. &lt;ref name=&quot;Happy families principles&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title='''Happy families have few rules, lots of ...''' |last=Eveld Knight |first=E.M. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2006 |publisher=Ridder Newspapers |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20060605/ai_n16454356/  |accessdate=24-Apr-2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Convenience link while redrafting - --&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geoffjw1978/Intimate_relationship_skills#ref20|(20)]]&lt;/sup&gt;

* '''Sensitivity to others''' - The principle of recognising that others could be under pressure from a variety of sources. Help can be found by amongst the cures for stress. &lt;!-- todo &quot;cite web&quot; not cite book: --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Survival strategies&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title='''Survival strategies''' - ''ways to cope under pressure'' |last=Mossallanejed, Phd |first=E. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher=psychiatryonline.org |location= |isbn= |page=1 |pages= |url=http://pn.psychiatryonline.org/content/42/3/9.2.full |accessdate=19-Apr-2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Convenience link while redrafting - --&gt; &lt;sup&gt; [[User_talk:Geoffjw1978/Intimate_relationship_skills#ref14|(14)]]&lt;/sup&gt; For example, is everyone getting some exercise?

* A '''happy home''' is important - while running a programme to help problem children in the 1970's the team discovered all of the problem children came from argumentative parents in conflict. &lt;ref name=&quot;Conflict In Intimate Relationships&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Convenience link while redrafting - --&gt; &lt;sup&gt; [[User_talk:Geoffjw1978/Intimate_relationship_skills#ref12|(12)]]&lt;/sup&gt;

* '''Forgiveness, not sulking''' -  Researchers at the Gottman Love Lab could tell within minutes if a relationship would survive by observing how the couple handled their disagreements, conflicts and arguments.
: One of their research conclusions was that after a conflict an essential feature is to quickly return to a normal, civil conversation.  Perhaps even happy and playful. &lt;ref name=&quot;Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work&quot;&gt;'''Seven Principles for Making Marriage Work''', by John Gottman. ''Lessons from the Love Labs.'' P.175&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Convenience link while redrafting - --&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geoffjw1978/Intimate_relationship_skills#ref4|(4)]]&lt;/sup&gt;
: It is key that neither party has stored up resentment and does not sulk about the argument. Clear the air with something fun and positive. Change the subject to something which is not contentious. This is similar to the successful distraction technique used with children to defuse conflict situations. &lt;!-- Convenience link while redrafting - --&gt; &lt;sup&gt; [[User_talk:Geoffjw1978/Intimate_relationship_skills#ref19|(19)]]&lt;/sup&gt;  A helpful approach to avoid this trap is to think about thinking, i.e., &quot;tell yourself to avoid sulking.&quot;  A person who does feel resentful could tell themselves not to sulk by using the [[#Thinking_about_thinking|thinking about thinking]] techniques.

    This observation contradicts those who advocate having a written set of &quot;house rules&quot; on the wall. “House rules” are no silver bullet. 


    Detailed rules do not provide flexibility to cope with sticky situations which arise in the future. One example of the advantage of principles compared with detailed rules would be the English legal system approach. The English legal system has lasted for centuries unaltered. Whereas a written, constitutional, approach requires frequent amendments and often has obsolete rules in it which become irrelevant and ignored over time. These obsolete rules hence water down the authority of the remaining rules. ''TODO: citation needed?''

===Seeking support - one pitfall=== 

Seeking support is generally considered an important way for people to cope with stress.
However there is a pitfall in seeking social support from friends about an intimate relationship. 

Seeking social support from friends has generally been found to be associated with negative outcomes &lt;ref name=&quot;Whiffen 1989&quot;&gt;Whiffen, V. E., &amp; Gotlib, I. H. (1989). '''Stress and coping in maritally distressed and nondistressed couples'''. Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 6, P.327-344.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- also mentioned, but can't find page num: &lt;ref name=&quot;Conflict In Intimate Relationships&quot;&gt;  &lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;&lt;!-- Convenience link while redrafting - --&gt; &lt;sup&gt; [[User_talk:Geoffjw1978/Intimate_relationship_skills#ref12|(12)]]&lt;/sup&gt;. 
It is not recorded in the research whether the couples who ended up in divorce found satisfactory social support or not.
The pitfall is that an intimate relationship is very private and a partner who confides in friends breaks the confidentiality boundaries which a couple have a right to expect. This can cause problems for the relationship. It can be interpreted as a lack of respect for the partner's privacy. Seeking professional support from a relationship-focussed counsellor (e.g., [[Relate]] &lt;!-- Convenience link while redrafting - --&gt; &lt;sup&gt; [[User_talk:Geoffjw1978/Intimate_relationship_skills#ref3|(3)]]&lt;/sup&gt;) should not normally have the same danger. 

In other words - &quot;''your friends are likely to side with you.''&quot;

===Seeking support - relationship therapy=== 

In seeking support via psychological therapy it has been found that the most important factor is the counsellor who performs the counselling. The actual therapy model or &quot;theory&quot; which the counsellor uses is less important.
Amongst [[Family_therapy#Summary_of_Family_Therapy_Theories_.26_Techniques|dozens of techniques]] are several therapy theories which have been empirically proven to be successful in helping intimate relationships - see &quot;Four therapy models which have proven successful&quot;. &lt;ref name=&quot;Four therapy models&quot;&gt;'''Four therapy models which have proven successful''', by Jay Lebow, 2006. ''Scoreboard for Couples Therapies''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Convenience link while redrafting - --&gt; &lt;sup&gt; [[User_talk:Geoffjw1978/Intimate_relationship_skills#ref24|(24)]]&lt;/sup&gt;

However, who delivers the therapy is more important than which particular model the therapist follows. 

Due to this finding there has been a call for a &quot;paradigm shift&quot; in training for therapists and counsellors. Therapists are more successful if they can fit the appropriate advice to the person's worldview. &lt;ref name=&quot;Is Who Delivers the Treatment More Important Than the Treatment Itself?&quot;&gt;'''Is Who Delivers the Treatment More Important Than the Treatment Itself?'''  by Adrian J. Blow, Douglas H. Sprenkle, Sean D. Davis.

A mindful approach has been shown to give the best results for long term success. Being mindful is better than running to a therapist or turning to drink or drugs when problems arise. &lt;ref name=&quot;Mindful approach to depression&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title='''Mindful approach to depression - M-[[CBT]]''' |last=Segal |first=Z.V. |authorlink= |coauthors=et al. |year=2010 |publisher=Archives of General Psychiatry |location= |isbn= |page=4 |pages= |url=http://archpsyc.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/67/12/1256 |accessdate=19-Apr-2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Convenience link while redrafting - --&gt; &lt;sup&gt; [[User_talk:Geoffjw1978/Intimate_relationship_skills#ref28|(28)]]&lt;/sup&gt;

===Selective approach to inclusion===

The skills in this article all have three things in common:

# Rooted in principles which have stood the test of time, thousands of years - from [[Socrates]], [[Marcus Aurelius]] to [[Winston Churchill]].
# Backed by current academic research into intimate relationships - checked by researchers objectively with real people.
# Habits successfully used to cope and thrive under pressure - proven skills drawn from survivors' stories.

The above principles are a demanding hurdle for inclusion in this list of skills. 

This approach has sorted the wheat from the chaff. 

This approach has distilled the best practices across different cultures from centuries of discussion, trial and error. 

The result is an unbiased list of skills.

The skills listed on this page avoid fly-by-night popular psychology, of the kind of &quot;this book will change your life&quot; genre. The skills listed are also wary of solutions shown on quick-fix TV shows.  The nature of TV programmes is to show bite-sized entertainment and the techniques portrayed do not necessarily translate into long term relationship success. 

Inspirational role models can provide insights. The techniques developed by others who have succeeded are included - they can impart the lessons they learnt. For instance, Holocaust survivor [[Viktor Frankl]] who triumphed by forming close friendships with his jailors, even in the midst of the horror of [[Auschwitz]]. &lt;!-- Convenience link while redrafting - --&gt; &lt;sup&gt; [[User_talk:Geoffjw1978/Intimate_relationship_skills#ref13|(13)]]&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Geoffjw1978/Intimate_relationship_skills#ref7|(7)]]&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;!-- list more inspirational role models who have been through hardship successfully - refs needed for:
     - building death railway in Burma

	- aboriginal indigenous tribes in australia
	- innuit 
	- european high alps rescue teams 
	- Himalayan sherpas who spend 3 months away from their wife while taking the herd to market in India.

Glossary removed, see talk page.
==Glossary==

This glossary is a focused attempt at summarising some of the specific jargon used in relationship skills research and social theory.  The jargon terms all appear in the references below and so this glossary assists newcomers to the field to pursue further reading in the sources of this article.

'''Active Listening'''

Active listening is one technique which can be tried by couples who have identified a need for it. 

Active listening can be useful but a feature to note is that happy couples rarely use active listening techniques in their day-to-day communication. 

Active listening has been found to make the listener defensive and often turn away from the approach. Training is required to listen. 

Essentially the technique is for the listener to acknowledge what the criticiser has said by repeating back a summary of the criticism. 

This communication therapy is based on the assumption that conflicts occur because individuals have failed to truly understand what their partners say to them. 

Active listening fosters improved communication skills by teaching the couple how to hear what they are saying to each other and how to respond to those statements in positive ways. Once a couple has learned to understand each other, they often find that they can resolve their differences and cooperate to find solutions to their marriage issues that meet their needs.


'''Affect'''

When the term ''affect'' is used by psychologists it refers to &quot;evoking emotion&quot;, &quot;stirring feelings&quot; or &quot;touching a nerve&quot;.

'''Cinematic Immersion'''

A variety of Active Listening which is useful for people who become defensive when criticised. 

 

'''[[Emotionally focused therapy]] for couples''' (EFT-C) is based on [[attachment theory]] and uses emotion as the target and agent of change. Emotions bring the past alive in rigid interaction patterns, which create and reflect absorbing emotional states.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Determining Parts of Speech==
The part of speech of a word can be identified from its form and meaning. The form of a word refers to the ending it takes and what position it takes in a sentence. Form alone gives us a lot of information on the part of speech of a word. It is sometimes useful to look at the meaning of a word when we need to determine the part of speech.

===Noun===
# A word is a noun if it takes the subject or object position in a sentence.
# Countable nouns have two forms, singular and plural. The plural form of most words is marked by the plural ending (s/es/ies).

===Adjective===

===Adverb===

===Verb===

      <text xml:space="preserve">All the letters on this page have the correct phonic sound except X. Not only is the picture of a xylophone difficult for a child to understand, but the X having the sound of Z is confusing for the learner. The only word starting with the sound  X that I know of is x-ray. Not the best example,(xample!)but at least it is less confusing for the learner. I would suggest that the picture show an x-ray of hands showing crossed fingers making an X.</text>

== → Gaijin ==

{{renameuser2| 1= | 2=Gaijin }}
* Datestamp: 12:34, 2 April 2011 (UTC)
* Reason: This is the name for my global account, and in wikibooks has no edits yet. [[Special:Contributions/210.165.148.173|210.165.148.173]] ([[User talk:210.165.148.173|discuss]]) 12:34, 2 April 2011 (UTC) [[Special:Contributions/210.165.148.173|210.165.148.173]] ([[User talk:210.165.148.173|discuss]]) 12:34, 2 April 2011 (UTC) P.S. To be true, my request is not a merge, but an usurpation. [[Wikibooks:USURP]] redirects here.
*:[[File:Yes_check.svg|15px|link=|alt=]] '''Done'''.  Your account should be autocreated upon login. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:33, 3 April 2011 (UTC)
== HstryQT → LoriLee ==

{{renameuser2| 1=HstryQT
 | 2=LoriLee
 }}
* Datestamp: 15:26, 28 April 2011 (UTC)
* Reason: I'm attempting to let you know that I'd like to usurp this account so that I can claim this username. Since this account has no edits this should not be a problem. See request [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Changing_username/Usurpations#HstryQT_.E2.86.92_LoriLee here]. Thanks.(moved here from [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ALoriLee&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=2088673&amp;oldid=2088670 here] by  &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 15:26, 28 April 2011 (UTC) for completeness.
*:The rename was done at Wikipedia, which would explain the detached account there.  I will usurp the account here blocking SUL.  Please visit [[Special:MergeAccount]] so that things can get back in order under the LoriLee username. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|discuss]]&lt;/small&gt; 18:20, 28 April 2011 (UTC)
::Ah, I see... while I was fiddling around trying to work out why the account appeared to have changed between two times of looking at it at WP (and then having to go off and do my real job) I can now see it was because the account was renamed between me first looking at WP and checking back. Obvious really... &lt;sigh&gt; next time I'll be a bit quicker. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:23, 28 April 2011 (UTC)
== Eric2530 → Eerick2530 ==

{{renameuser2| 1=Eric2530
 | 2=Eerick2530
 }}
* Datestamp: 16:53, 29 April 2011 (UTC)
* Reason: Reason for requested renaming.Wikipedia does not accept current name. [[Special:Contributions/70.36.191.195|70.36.191.195]] ([[User talk:70.36.191.195|discuss]]) 16:53, 29 April 2011 (UTC) [[Special:Contributions/70.36.191.195|70.36.191.195]] ([[User talk:70.36.191.195|discuss]]) 16:53, 29 April 2011 (UTC)

:Do you mean you cannot logon to Wikipedia with your current account, Eric2530? If so, this is because it hasn't been unified. Also, you need to logon here using the account to request the rename so that we know it is you who is requesting it please. Visiting [[Special:MergeAccount]] will create a unified account and allow you to logon on to any project &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 19:51, 29 April 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Structural Functionalism''' is a sociological theory that attempts to explain why society functions the way it does by focusing on the relationships between the various social institutions that make up society (e.g., government, law, education, religion,etc). 

==Detailed Description==
Structural Functionalism is a theoretical understanding of society that posits social systems are collective means to fill social needs. In order for social life to survive and develop in society there are a number of activities that need to be carried out to ensure that certain needs are fulfilled. In the structural functionalist model, individuals produce necessary goods and services in various institutions and roles that correlate with the norms of the society. &lt;ref name=&quot;Gingrich&gt;Gingrich, P. (1999). Functionalism &amp; parsons. Unpublished manuscript, Department of Sociology and Social Studies, University of Regina , Regina, Canada. Retrieved from http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/n2f99.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, one of the key ideas in Structural Functionalism is that society is made-up of groups or institutions, which are cohesive, share common norms, and have a definitive culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hak2007&quot;&gt;Hak, Durk. 2007. &quot;Stark and Finke or Durkheim on Conversion and (Re-)Affiliation: An Outline of a Structural Functionalist Rebuttal to Stark and Finke.&quot; Social Compass. 54, 2:295-312.&lt;/ref&gt; [[w:Robert K. Merton|Robert K. Merton]] argued that functionalism is about the more static or concrete aspects of society,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hak2007&quot;/&gt; institutions like government or religions.  However, any group large enough to be a social [[w:institution|institution]] is included in Structural Functionalist thinking, from religious denominations to sports clubs and everything in between.  Structural Functionalism asserts that the way society is organized is the most natural and efficient way for it to be organized.  

Gender inequality offers a good illustration.  According to Structural Functionalist thought, women being subordinate to men allows the cogs of society to function smoothly as everyone in the society knows his or her respective position in the hierarchy.  The implication, of course, is that, because society is functioning smoothly with gender stratification, such stratification is acceptable and efforts should not be made to change the arrangement.  This example illustrates that Structural Functionalism is generally seen as being supportive of the [[w:status quo|status quo]].  

Another key characteristic of Structural Functionalism is that it views society as constantly striving to be at a state of [[w:equilibrium|equilibrium]], which suggests there is an inherent drive within human societies to ''cohere'' or stick together.  This is known as the cohesion issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hak2007&quot;/&gt;  Societies strive toward equilibrium, not through dictatorial mandate by the leaders of society but rather because the social structure of societies encourages equilibrium.  

For example, [[w:Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow laws]] in the southern United States were a formalized version of informal structural advantages that empowered whites.  Because of the history of slavery in the southern United States, whites had amassed more wealth than blacks.  During slavery, whites controlled the government and all of the major institutions in the South.  After slavery ended, whites continued to control many of these institutions, but because they were outnumbered in some areas by blacks, threatening their dominance, they instituted formal laws, Jim Crow laws, that allowed them to maintain their structural advantages.  And whites were able to pass these laws because they already controlled many of the social institutions instrumental in the passage of laws (e.g., courts, government, businesses, etc.).  Thus, the advantages whites had prior to a change in society allowed them to maintain their advantages after the change through both informal and formal means because of the structure of society.

Structural Functionalism does much to explain why certain aspects of society continue as they always have, despite some phenomena being clearly less beneficial for society as a whole (e.g., Jim Crow laws).  However, Structural Functionalism falls short in explaining opposition to social institutions and social structure by those being oppressed.  

===Assumptions===
There are a number of key assumptions in Structural Functionalist theory.  One of these, that societies strives toward equilibrium, was detailed above.  Another assumption is that institutions are distinct and should be studied individually.{{Fact|This does not seem to fall in line with most explications of Structural Functionalism.}}  Many Structural Functionalists look at institutions individually as though they are divorced from other institutions.  This is a mistake, as institutions are interlinked in society and those employing a structural functionalist approach should be take into consideration the network of relationships that exist between these institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sjoberg&quot;/&gt;

===Definitions of Concepts===
''[[w:Social cohesion|Social cohesion]]'' describes the bonds that bring people together in a society.  In order for groups to be cohesive in a social context, positive membership attitudes and behaviors have to be produced and maintained.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedkin2004&quot;&gt;Friedkin, Noah E. 2004. Social Cohesion. Annual Review of Sociology. 30:409-25.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social cohesion can be looked at on both an individual and group level.  Individual-levels include: an individual’s desire or intention to remain a part of a group, her attitudes and beliefs about the group, the individuals’ intention to sever, weaken, maintain, or strengthen her membership or participation in a groups, and her susceptibility to group influence.  Social cohesion at a group level is directly affected by the individual members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedkin2004&quot;/&gt;

''[[w:Social inequality|Social inequality]]'' refers to any scenario in which individuals in a society do not have equal social status. Areas of potential inequality include voting rights, freedom of speech and assembly, the extent of property rights and access to education, health care, quality housing and other social goods.  Social inequality is an important characteristic of Structural Functionalism as the theory assumes, since inequality exists, there needs to be a certain level of inequality in order for a society to operate.  One possible function of inequality is to motivate people,as people are motivated to carry out work through a rewards system.  Rewards may include income, status, prestige, or power.{{fact}}

''[[w:Interdependence|Interdependence]]'' is a central theme in structural functionalism; it refers to the parts of society sharing a common set of principles.{{Fact}}  Institutions, organizations, and individuals are all interdependent with one another.

''[[w:Social_equilibrium|Equilibrium]]'', in a social context, is the internal and external balance in a society.  While temporary disturbances may upset the equilibrium of society, because of social structure, society will eventually return to a balanced, orderly state.  That society strives toward equilibrium also means that changes happen slowly.{{fact}}

===Propositions===
Propositions are proposed relationships between two concepts.  This section explores some of the propositions of structural functionalism.

One proposition derived from Structural Functionalist theory is that people have [[w:social capital|social capital]], and that greater amounts of social capital translate into benefits.  Well integrated members of an institution (those with substantial social capital) will remain members of the institution in order to maximize the potential of their social capital.  Schepens found support for this proposition by examining religious switching; less than 5% of church members in the Netherlands shift their church associations during their lifetime, conserving and maximizing their social capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sjoberg&quot;/&gt;

One of the assumptions of Structural Functionalism is that a society is cohesive if it consists of various intermediate groups which share the same norms.  This assumption leads to another proposition: The higher the level of integration between these intermediate groups, the more cohesive society will be as a whole. The absence of social cohesion can result in greater violence toward others and one's self.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hak2007&quot;/&gt; 

===General Conceptual Diagram===
The diagram below is a general conceptual diagram of Structural functionalism. It shows that all of the different organizations and institutions in society are interdependent. When one institution in society changes, other institutions accommodate that change by changing as well, though the ultimate effect is to slow overall change. 

[[File:General Diagram_of_Structural-Functionalism.png|thumb|500px|center]]

===Specific Conceptual Diagram===
Below is a chart depicting how deviance is functional for society and how society responds to deviance.  A &quot;deviant&quot; individual commits an act that is deemed by the rest of society as criminal, because it leads to public outrage and punishments.  Because a large portion of society respond to the action as though it is deviant, this draws a boundary between what is and is not deviant.  Thus, deviance actually helps to indicate what is not deviant, or, the function of labeling behaviors or ideas as deviance is to insure that most people do not engage in those behaviors.

=='''History of Structural functionalism'''==
Functionalism developed slowly over time with the help of many sociologists in different parts of the world. Perhaps the most significant contributors to the initial development of this theory are [[w:Émile Durkheim|Émile Durkheim]] and [[w:Alfred Radcliffe-Brown|A.R. Radcliffe-Brown]]. However, we begin with [[w:Herbert Spencer|Herbert Spencer]].

Herbert Spencer, an English sociologist, was a forerunner of formalized Structural Functioanlism. He is best known for coining the phrase &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; in his book ''Principles of Sociology'' (1896).   Spencer’s intention was to support a societal form of natural selection.  One of the primary focii in Spencer's work was societal equilibrium. Spencer argued that there is a natural tendency in society towards equilibrium.  Thus, even when the conditions of the society are altered, the resulting changes to the social structure will balance out, returning the society to equilibrium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bain&quot;&gt;Bain, A. “Spencer’s, Principles of Sociology.” Fair Use. Mind. Volume 1 No. 1, 1876.&lt;http://fair-use.org/‌mind/‌1876/‌01/‌critical-notices/‌the-principles-of-sociology&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 19th century French Sociologist Émile Durkheim laid the primary foundations of Structural Functionalism.  Durkheim's theory was, at least in part, a response to evolutionary speculations of theorists such as [[w:E.B. Taylor|E.B. Taylor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;uofa&quot;&gt;Porth, E., Neutzling, K., &amp; Edwards, J. (n.d.). Anthropological Theories - Department of Anthropology - The University of Alabama. The University of Alabama. Retrieved April 15, 2011, from http://anthropology.ua.edu/cultures/cultures.php&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim originally wanted to explain social institutions as a shared way for individuals in society to meet their own biological needs. He wanted to understand the value of cultural and social traits by explaining them in regards to their contribution to the operation of the overall system of society and life. Later the focus for structural functionalism changed to be more about the ways that social institutions in society meet the social needs of individuals within that society. 

Durkheim was interested in four main aspects of society: (1) why societies formed and what holds them together, (2) religion, (3) suicide, and (4) deviance and crime.  Durkheim addressed his first focus in his book, ''The Division of Labor in Society''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Durkheim&quot;&gt;Durkheim, Emile. Division of Labor in Society. N.p.: Free Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Durkheim noticed that the division of labor was evident across all societies and wanted to know why. Durkheim’s answer to this question can be found in his idea of &quot;[[w:solidarity|solidarity]]&quot;.  In older, more primitive societies Durkheim argued that &quot;[[w:mechanical solidarity|mechanical solidarity]] kept everyone together. Mechanic Solidarity here refers to everyone doing relatively similar tasks. For instance, in hunting and gathering societies there was not a substantial division of labor; people hunted or gathered. Durkheim theorized that shared values, common symbols, and systems of exchange functioned as the tools of cohesion in these societies. &lt;ref name=&quot;Perrin1973&quot;&gt;Perrin, Robert G. 1973. “The Functionalist Theory of Change Revisited.” The Pacific Sociologist Review 16,1.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence, members of society performed similar tasks to keep the community running.  In more modern and complex societies individuals are quite different and they do not perform the same tasks.  However, the diversity actually leads to a different form of solidarity - interdependence.  Durkheim referred to this as &quot;organic solidarity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pope, Whitney. “Inside Organic Solidarity.” American Sociological Review 48.5 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;. Organic solidarity leads to a strong sense of individuals being dependent on one another. For instance, while a construction worker may be able to build homes for people, if he is injured on the job, he will turn to a doctor for treatment (and probably a lawyer to sue his employer).  The division of labor in society requires specialization, and the result is organic solidarity.

Durkheim's work on suicide was also tied to structural functionalism. In his book, ''Suicide'', Durkheim hypothesized that social relationships reduced the likelihood of suicide. By collecting data across large groups in Europe, Durkheim was able to distinguish patterns in suicide rates and connect those patterns with other variables.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perrin1973&quot;/&gt; Throughout the book, Durkheim explained that the weaker social ties a society possessed the more likely they were to commit suicide.  Inversely, the greater the cohesive bond between individuals the less likely one was to commit suicide. One concrete example Durkheim explored was the difference in solidarity between Protestants and Catholics. Due to a variety of factors, Durkheim argued that Protestants had lower social solidarity than Catholics, and their weaker bonds resulted in higher rates of suicide.  Thus, solidarity helped maintain societal order.

Another thread in the development of Structural Functionalism comes from England, where it emerged from the study of anthropology in the early twentieth century in the theorizing of [[w:Bronislaw Malinowski|Bronislaw Malinowski]] and A.R. Radcliffe-Brown. Malinowski argued that cultural practices had physiological and psychological functions, such as the satisfaction of desires.&lt;ref name=&quot;uofa&quot;/&gt;

Radcliffe-Brown’s structural functionalism focused on social structure.  He argued that the social world constituted a separate &quot;level&quot; of reality, distinct from those of biological forms (people) and inorganic forms. Radcliffe-Brown argued that explanations of social phenomena had to be constructed at the social level.&lt;ref name=&quot;uofa&quot;/&gt; To Radcliffe-Brown this meant that people were merely replaceable, temporary occupants of social roles, that were of no inherent worth. To Radcliffe-Brown, individuals were only significant in relation to their positions in the overall structure of social roles in society.  

In the United States, functionalism was formalized in sociological thinking by Talcott Parsons, who introduced the idea that there are stable structural categories that make up the interdependent systems of a society and functioned to maintain society. He argued that this [[w:homeostasis|homeostasis]] is the critical characteristic of societies. Parsons supported individual integration into social structures, meaning that individuals should find how they fit into the different aspects of society on their own, rather than being assigned roles.  Parsons saw social systems as &quot;a plurality of individual actors interacting with each other in a situation which has at least a physical or environmental aspect, actors who are motivated in terms of a tendency to the &quot;optimization of gratification&quot; and whose relation to their situations, including each other, is defined and mediated in terms of a system of culturally structured and shared symbols.&quot;{{fact}} The foundation of Parsons’ social system is the status-role complex, which consists of structural elements or positions that individuals hold in a system. These positions are referred to as ''statuses'' and are occupied by individuals who must carry out the roles in order to maintain the order of the system. Therefore, within this social system individuals perform certain roles to fulfill the system’s functions; these roles are a function of their statuses. As society progresses there are new roles and statuses that occur, allowing individuals to express their unique personalities resulting in individualism. 

Another important aspect of Parsons’ social systems argument is his theory of action. Parsons developed the ''theory of action'' based on the idea that the decision making of an individual in a social system has motivational significance to himself.{{fact}} The individual is constantly reminded of the norms and values of society, which binds him to society. The individual is, therefore, motivated to reach personal goals that are defined by their cultural system and simultaneously these goals benefit society as a whole.

Structural functionalism was the dominant approach of sociology between World War II and the Vietnam War. 

In the 1960’s Structural Functionalism was quite popular and used extensively in research.  It was “… perhaps the dominant theoretical orientation in sociology and anthropology”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sjoberg&quot;&gt;Sjoberg, Gideon. Contradictory Functional Requirements and Social Systems. Sage Publications, Inc., June 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 1970’s, it was no longer so widely credited. &quot;Structural Functionalism has lost much importance, but modified it directs much sociological inquiry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bottomore, Tom. Competing Paradigms in Macrosociology. Annual Review of Sociology, Aug. 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Examples of Structural Functionalist Oriented Research==
===September 11, 2001===
On [[w:September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]] modern American culture was disoriented due to an attack . This event affected both American travel customs, reflecting the Structural Functionalist idea that a change in one element of society results in changes in other aspects of society.  Before the attacks airport security in the U.S. existed, but they changed substantially as a result of the attacks. Scrutiny of travelers was heightened and included new protocols, like the removal of shoes, belts, and eventually liquids, as well as random, more detailed screenings.  Thus, a change in the cultural sense of security resulted in a corresponding change in travel protocol.

===Increase in Technology===
Modern technology has resulted in substantial changes to the economy and the military. Before the advent of telephones, the internet, and [[w:video conferencing|video conferencing]], most business meetings occurred face to face. If an individual had a business proposal for a company in San Francisco but lived in New York, she would have to travel to San Francisco. Modern technology has changed this, reducing the necessity of business travel. As a result, the function of face to face meetings in business have changed; they are no longer a necessary part of social interactions and have therefore begun to lose their structural role.

Likewise, The traditional approach to war between two nations was an all out invasion involving hundreds of thousands if not millions of troops. During [[w:WWI|WWI]], America sent over two million men to fight. During [[w:WWII|WWII]], American sent over eleven million soldiers to fight. During the [[w:Korean War|Korean War]] America sent approximately 1.5 million troops. And finally in 1990, just over 700,000 soldiers fought in [[w:Operation Desert Storm|Operation Desert Storm]]. Due to the increase in military technology and new military tactical norms the number of military personnel present in war zones has dramatically decreased. When America invaded Iraq in 2001, they sent 150,000. Modern technology, including advanced, long-range weapons and unmanned drones, have changed the function of mass invasions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey, guys, I just noticed that you didn't have any references popping up at the bottom of your Wikibooks article even though the Edit text for this Wikibooks article included &amp;#060;ref&amp;#062; and &amp;#060;/ref&amp;#062; tag uses. I noticed a similar thing happening to our Wikibooks article when I forgot to append a &amp;#060;/ref&amp;#062; to one of my &amp;#060;ref&amp;#062; tags, and so I was going to try to fix up your article as well in that way, but then I noticed that you were using &amp;#060;ref name=&quot;Something&quot; /&amp;#062;, which might either be some special html formatting that does the same thing as &amp;#060;ref&amp;#062; and &amp;#060;/ref&amp;#062; or might be a way to indicate to you guys to fill in those references later. Either way, although I did one edit, I decided to undo it and let you guys deal with your Wikibooks article accordingly. If you inadvertently put in &amp;#060;ref ... /&amp;#062;, then I would suggest changing that to &amp;#060;ref ...&amp;#062;...&amp;#060;/ref&amp;#062; to allow your references to appear at the bottom. -mtg8c [[User:Mtg8c STS|Mtg8c STS]] ([[User talk:Mtg8c STS|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Mtg8c STS|contribs]]) 04:08, 29 April 2011 (UTC)</text>

==Interpreting Poetry==
&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;/source&gt;

=== Introduction ===
 This book develops the set of interpretive techniques needed for a reader to respond to various out-of-the-ordinary uses poets make of words. Running through these interpretive techniques are the following more abstract concerns: foregrounding, associating, and patterning. These ideas will be explained more fully as we focus on each of the following traits of poetry: sound patterning, images and image patterns, themes, word choice, figurative language, and finally structure and tone. Many of the poems in the book are my own, but I will also bring in poems by other writers to illustrate a point.

  Here as a poem that &quot;asks&quot; the reader to see and hear the simplest kind of sound patterning, end rhyme:

==== To my Wife ====

If love is like a bridge
or maybe like a grudge,

and time is like a river
that kills us with a shiver,

then what have all these mornings meant
but aging into love?

What now is straight must have been bent;
what now is whole must have been rent.

My hand is now your glove.

  One of the &quot;out-of-the-ordinary&quot; uses of words here is the echoes heard at the ends of lines. The speaker throws a slight curve ball at the beginning--&quot;bridge&quot; and &quot;grudge&quot; don't rhyme perfectly. they are an example of slant rhyme. But from that point one, we have perfect rhymes, though not in an exact pattern--&quot;river&quot; and &quot;shiver&quot;; then &quot;meant,&quot; &quot;bent,&quot; and &quot;rent&quot;; and finally &quot;love&quot; and &quot;glove.&quot; Even that small bit of sound patterning pushes this statement out of the ordinary. I also asks you, the reader, to look at the way the statement is made and not just at its message.
  You notice that &quot;bridge&quot; and &quot;grudge&quot; oppose each other, one joining and one separating emotionally at least. The pair &quot;river&quot; and &quot;shiver&quot; introduces the theme of time and joins it with its ancient image of a river, with the added minor chord of our being killed, drowned perhaps, with a &quot;shiver.&quot;
  The then-clause applies the imagery of bridge and river and shiver to the speaker and the person addressed. This clause tells us that the &quot;mortalizing&quot; passage of time may be redeemed by the growth of love. That can happen if the couple do the repair work suggested by straightening whatever has been &quot;bent&quot; and knitting together what has been torn apart (&quot;rent&quot; past tense of &quot;rend&quot;). And the &quot;love-glove&quot; rhyme rounds off the poem, the theme word (&quot;love&quot;) being fused with the image word (&quot;glove&quot;).
  You can see from our looking AT the rhyme words rather than through them the poem becomes deeper. You have begun to practice foregrounding.
  Here's another one

=== He Contemplates His Celibacy ===

In the gray air
I look for a beginning
and try not to care
whether winter lasts.

Out of the sky
the snowflakes whirl,
bringing to my ears and eyes
their childlike blows.

Children I have known
or should father
sleep in my bones.
I hear their cries.

They would awake
not for a night
and brief breeding,
but to feed on their father.

No crooked leg
stirs in the snow.
Winter drags.
Nothing wishes to grow.

  &quot;To My Wife&quot; is a simple poem without much to push it out of the ordinary other than the use of rhymes that are semantically associated with each other. &quot;He Contemplates his Celibacy&quot; is more complex. (Anytime you want to understand a poem you should be ready to look up unfamiliar words like &quot;celibacy.&quot; That's become ridiculously easy-- 
http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/celibacy.) This one has only two perfect end rhymes, three slant rhymes, and one stanza (group of rhymed lines) that breaks the rhyme scheme altogether. See if you can find them.
  The &quot;gray air&quot; is associated in the speaker's mind with the winter, the coldness, that he tries to dismiss. He also associates the winter, this time the snow, with unborn children whose potential he feels within him. Then, breaking the rhyme pattern, he shifts to the image of insects. His unborn sons and daughters transform in his mind into offspring that destroy their parent, as some species of insects actually do. The last stanza has a perfect rhyme and a slant rhyme. The speaker insists that there is no buried life waiting to be born. Perhaps unconsciously the speaker's attributing the absence of a wish for life applies to him. Just as the speaker will father no children, so he himself will not grow. If you as a reader associate this denial-of-new-life poem with the winter solstice, to which it runs counter, that is your call. Associations usually need to be stated non-dogmatically, as possible meanings but not necessary ones.

'''This is perhaps the most common set of modern lyrics:'''

This is the house that Jack built.

This is the malt that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the rat that ate the malt&lt;br /&gt;
That lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the cat that killed the rat&lt;br /&gt;
That ate the malt that lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the dog that worried the cat&lt;br /&gt;
That killed the rat that ate the malt&lt;br /&gt;
That lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the cow with the crumpled horn&lt;br /&gt;
That tossed the dog that worried the cat&lt;br /&gt;
That killed the rat that ate the malt&lt;br /&gt;
That lay in the house that Jack built.

This is the maiden all forlorn&lt;br /&gt;
That milked the cow with the crumpled horn&lt;br /&gt;
. . .

The nursery rhyme and cumulative tale &quot;This Is the House That Jack Built&quot; appeared in an 1887 book of children's stories. The poem does not actually tell the story of Jack building a house, but instead shows how the house is indirectly linked to numerous things and people. It is believed to date back to the mid-sixteenth century, but the first printed edition was in 1755. &quot;Modern?&quot;
[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/This_Is_the_House_That_Jack_Built]]

  
Children's poetry is a good place to begin--a life or an exploration of poetry. In the lines above, by the time you get to the &quot;cow with the crumpled horn,&quot; I hope you want to find out where this crumpled tale goes. But look at some other things. &quot;Appeared in an 1887 book&quot; says that poetry can lead you into the valuable past and that you may have to find out something you didn't know.

&quot;Does not actually tell the story of Jack building a house&quot; makes you wonder why a poem titled &quot;This Is the House That Jack Built&quot; does NOT tell you about Jack's handiwork. The answer is that poetry is oblique. Emily Dickinson, the great nineteenth-century American poet, says, &quot;Tell all the truth but tell it slant.&quot; &quot;Slant&quot; here means &quot;oblique.&quot; Why should this be? Partly because the slantedness leads you to &quot;numerous things and people.&quot; Poetry works by association.

Let's look at &quot;The House That Jack Built.&quot; When you read it aloud you hear the rhythm, an alternation of unstressed and unstressed syllables. this poem is built mainly of one-syllable words so you don't have to worry if you have trouble dividing words into syllables. You hear &quot;THIS is the HOUSE that JACK BUILT.&quot; You hear this alternation of one- and two-beat feet as you move along. &quot;THIS is the CAT that KILLED the RAT&quot;--every line beginning and ending with a stress, a beat.

What else do you notice about the sound as you read the poem aloud? Every line as a slight rest in the middle, a &quot;caesura.&quot; And every caesura comes before the word &quot;that.&quot; That is one reason we read poetry, because we enjoy all kinds of rhythms. We enjoy rapid pace suddenly pausing and then picking up again.

And you hear the vowel-consonant music. Obvious rhymes like &quot;cat&quot; and &quot;rat,&quot; but also slant rhymes (remember slantedness?) like &quot;malt&quot; and &quot;rat.

== Overview ==

The '''''Ministry of Magic''''', in obvious parallel to the UK's multiple Ministries in charge of aspects of governance, is the governing body in England which oversees the Wizarding population. The Ministry is both a [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Ministry of Magic|physical location]] (offices), and an organization. This article will discuss its organization.

== Extended Description ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

We, and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]], first hear of the Ministry when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]], reading [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/The Daily Prophet|the ''Daily Prophet'']], comments, &quot;Ministry o' Magic messin' things up as usual.&quot; Hagrid goes on to explain that the main function of the Ministry is to keep Muggles unaware of the existence of Wizards, so that they won't keep looking for magical solutions to their problems. We hear very little else about the Ministry, except that [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]]'s father is a Ministry employee, until the end of that book, when the students are given a note that says they are not allowed to practice magic outside the school. We are not told about this at the time, but the reason for this note is [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Underage Sorcery|the Decree for the Reasonable Restriction of Underage Sorcery]], which is enforced by the Ministry.

The Decree is first mentioned by name in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'']], when [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Dobby|Dobby]] does magic to attempt to keep Harry away from Hogwarts. A letter of reprimand, signed by one [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Mafalda Hopkirk|Mafalda Hopkirk]], is sent by Owl Post from the Ministry. We do have other contact with the Ministry in this book, primarily through the person of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic]]. We see him when he comes to put Hagrid in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]], as he is suspected of being the one who is opening the Chamber.

In [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'']], we see the Ministry's repeated efforts to recapture [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Sirius Black|Sirius Black]]. An astute reader here may begin to discern that the Ministry seems more interested in retaining its reputation, than in acting correctly. Fudge's refusal to even listen to Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]]'s side of the story, while accepting [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Severus Snape|Professor Snape]]'s version of events unquestioned, leaves us feeling that Fudge, at least, is a very politic creature, doing what he feels will give him the greatest amount of popularity.

We see this to an even larger extent in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], when the publicity exercise of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Triwizard Tournament|Triwizard Tournament]] tragically ends with the death of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cedric Diggory|Cedric Diggory]], and the return of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]]. The Ministry's immediate actions are to spin the former and deny the latter, out of fear of being pilloried by public opinion. [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Percy Weasley|Percy]], given a promotion to assist Fudge directly as part of the apparent cover-up of the Ministry's failing to protect its own employee, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Bartemius Crouch Sr.|Bartemius Crouch]], accepts the Ministry story at face value, while [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Arthur Weasley|Mr. Weasley]], while remaining a Ministry employee, finds Dumbledore more believable. This difference of opinion estranges Percy from the rest of his family.

This trend of attempting to minimize the immediate damage continues throughout [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|''Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix'']], with the Ministry attempting to get Harry drummed out of the Wizarding community, forcing teachers and oversight on Hogwarts, removing privileges from [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Albus Dumbledore|Professor Dumbledore]] and anyone who accepts his statement that Voldemort has returned, and encouraging the ''Daily Prophet'' to publish stories denigrating Dumbledore and Harry. Ministry activities end up having to include concealing the reason for the mass breakout from Azkaban, as the Ministry cannot explain, or even admit to, the defection of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Dementor|Dementors]]. This position of denial becomes untenable once Fudge and several other witnesses actually see Voldemort in the Atrium of the Ministry.

As Fudge had expected, news of Voldemort's return results in his ouster; early in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'']], we learn that Fudge has been voted out, and has been replaced by the previous head of the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Auror|Aurors]] department, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rufus Scrimgeour|Rufus Scrimgeour]]. It is at this point also that we learn of the means of communication between the Ministry of Magic and the Muggle Prime Minister. Again reacting to public opinion, Scrimgeour starts a harsh crackdown against suspected [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Death Eaters|Death Eaters]], at one point placing the completely harmless [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Stan Shunpike|Stan Shunpike]] in Azkaban for claiming &quot;inside knowledge&quot; of Death Eater activities. Contact with the Ministry in this story is largely limited to two sessions with Scrimgeour, in which Harry's co-operation with the Ministry is solicited for his propaganda value; Harry turns Scrimgeour down flat both times.

Finally, in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows'']], Scrimgeour is apparently murdered, and the Ministry is put in charge of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Pius Thicknesse|Pius Thicknesse]], who is himself entirely under Voldemort's control. The Ministry at this point becomes a propaganda organ and means of eliminating Muggles and Muggle-born wizards, condemning them in mock trials.

== Analysis ==

While the Ministry is mentioned very often in the series, and almost always in a manner that refers to the organization rather than the place, we really learn very little about the organization of the Ministry. We are told that the Minister is elected, as Fudge says, at the end of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire/Chapter 36|''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'']], that if he was to try and carry out any of the instructions that Dumbledore suggests, he would be voted out immediately. And while Fudge is, as we learn [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince/Chapter 1|in the sixth book]], replaced by Scrimgeour following the revelation that Voldemort had returned, we do not see the mechanism used for that vote. The reader does rather get the feeling that the magical government runs completely independently of the Muggle government, but apart from that we learn little about its operation. We do learn that the Ministry is very quick to follow the lead of the currently elected Minister, almost to the extent of being his own personal fiefdom; the Ministry as a whole seems to shift almost overnight from Fudge's policy of denial to Scrimgeour's policy of active defence, and again to Thicknesse's anti-Muggle stance.

We can also quite plainly see that the Ministry is, like almost all political organizations, driven by popularity. Like any politician, Fudge's sole intent is to get re-elected; and while Scrimgeour is brought in, clearly, in reaction to Fudge's ineffectiveness, in the hopes that he might do something about Voldemort, he can equally be seen to be pandering to public opinion. In discussion with Arthur Weasley and with Scrimgeour himself, Harry quickly determines that while the Ministry under Scrimgeour is more dynamic, more active, its efforts against the Death Eaters are barely more effective than Fudge's studied denial, and are resulting in the imprisonment of obvious innocents simply so that the Ministry appears to be doing something. Perhaps interestingly, the Ministry is most effective under Thicknesse, presumably because no matter how unpopular the measures taken, there is no worry about getting re-elected; Thicknesse will stay head of the Ministry as long as Voldemort is present to pull his strings. 

We do learn that the Ministry, like all human groups, has organized itself into sub-groups, and we become aware of the bureaucracy inherent in the situation. In various asides that Arthur Weasley makes concerning the maintenance workers, and our own observation of Arthur's own work space, we learn that the Ministry is rife with office politics even in times of peace: the maintenance workers' demands for more pay were supported by a solid month of dreary rainfall outside the Ministry's magical windows, and Arthur's unpopular department is required to squeeze two workers and all their files into a converted broom closet.

In ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'', Hagrid mentions that if Muggles knew that wizards existed, they would always be looking for magical answers to their problems. This point, interestingly, is revisited in ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', where the Muggle Prime Minister asks &quot;But for heaven's sake &amp;ndash; you're ''wizards!'' You can do ''magic!'' Surely you can sort out &amp;ndash; well &amp;ndash; ''anything!''&quot; It falls to Fudge to remind him, gently, &quot;The trouble is, the other side can do magic too, Prime Minister.&quot; This is a secondary effect of the issue Hagrid was mentioning, about the Muggle desire for magical solutions to all problems. While Hagrid's emphasis seemed to be on the bother, on the disturbances in wizards' lives caused by Muggles wanting quick and supposedly effortless answers, here we see that problems can be created by magic, as easily as solutions. And who is to say that the magical solution to one person's problems does not pose a problem for another person? Because of this, one can see that the apparent mission of the Ministry, to keep Muggles unaware of the existence of wizards, is a very important one. And this does not even touch on the problem of Muggles resenting those who can do magic, resentment which we see all too clearly in the behaviour of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Vernon Dursley|Uncle Vernon]] and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Petunia Dursley|Aunt Petunia]].

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Intermediate Spoiler}}

While Harry is the hero of the story, a hero cannot work in a vacuum. Harry must, in the end, stand alone against Voldemort, but as Voldemort has his Death Eaters, so must there be an approximately equally strong organization opposing them. It would be something of an immature belief that this organization would be the government. An adult knows that the government's prime directive is to preserve itself, a tendency that has been shown to us multiple times by Cornelius Fudge and the Ministry under his control. It would be equally immature to believe that under Fudge's successor, Rufus Scrimgeour, it would be less likely to attempt self-preservation, or more effective at supporting the Wizarding world. We see, in fact, that the Ministry is looking for some sign of approval from Harry that it can publicize to make their onerous and ineffective actions more palatable. It is of interest to the more serious reader that the Ministry is portrayed as inept from almost the beginning of the series, and that the nature of their ineptness is revealed appropriately to the reader as the complexity of the books increases. Commentary on the Ministry in [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone/Chapter 4|''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'']] is limited to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid's]] comment, &quot;Ministry of Magic messin' up as usual.&quot; In ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'', we start to see the Ministry spinning facts to retain power, a process that continues throughout the next book. In ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'', we see the Ministry trying to show how it is battling the threat represented by the resurgent Voldemort, and failing. And in the final book, the Ministry falls completely under Voldemort's power, all its security theatre, in the end, futile. To the student, the progressive revelations of the specific failings of the Ministry to support the Wizarding population, in the name of retaining power for itself, merit attention, especially as the quality of the revelations seems age appropriate for the target audience of each successive volume.

The government clearly can't aid Harry against Voldemort in any effective way; that assistance is much more ably rendered by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Major Events/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]]. All the same, there must be a government; we can't expect the Wizarding world to run itself, any more than we can expect the Muggle world to run itself. Equally clearly, that government must be by and of Wizards; a Muggle, with his limited understanding of magic, would not be able to take any effective part in governing wizards. And so we have the Ministry, a branch of the British government largely independent of the much larger Muggle government, but sharing many organizational characteristics. One wonders whether the author has a personal reason to show the government, through the Ministry, as ineffective; it is certainly true that a younger reader will receive a very unflattering, though probably reasonably accurate, portrait of the activities of government from these books. A more mature reader, meanwhile, will be both appalled and amused by the gyrations of the Ministry.

      <comment>/* Empathy as emotional communication. */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=By way of introduction=
I guess this my current source page until otherwise, as it is hard to know where to put personal data in the wiki-sphere.

==Current==
I am finishing a masters in psychotherapy, and it seems my talent is with the youthful crooks (to be blunt) as I kind of &quot;get them&quot; (and, most important, &quot;accept&quot; them) as a life-long urban dweller.

===Empathy as emotional communication.===
My major work is the [[wikiversity:Empathy Model| empathy model]], which is a &quot;clean room&quot; model of psychology based entirely on popular conceptions by both people suffering from dysfunctions and those concerned about them collected and developed on the Care2.com activist web community.  I have found that the nano-second that I attempt to use my &quot;official&quot; psychological learning, I lose my audience.  So there...

===I started humanities with education===
I hoped to get into education through the back door via &quot;alternative&quot; routes so that I could stay on my &quot;default brain network,&quot; which is (loosely) construcTIVist (and more recently, socially construTIONist).

===Saving construtivism===
This is my present project that directly fell off of the back of &quot;family systems.&quot;  If you know anything about family (or organizational) systems...

I developed a lot of text that I will place in a temporary article: [[User:John Bessa/Saving Constructivism]] to prepare for a page [[Constructivism]] which I will begin from the bottom up by annotating the source material: it will be here-and-now-oriented, only showing older information only as  it supports current information, or constructions.  (Outdated, orphaned matieral will not be included).  I accept that collaboration in the wiki-sphere is really at the level of the wiki and rarely at the level of the data, so I expect to do this work solo with a little encouragement, and perhaps a few hassles, which is not a problem.

This theme studies two types of extreme environment:
#Cold and high-altitude environments (polar, glacial areas, periglacial areas, high mountains in non‑tropical latitudes)
#Hot, arid environments (hot deserts and semi‑arid areas)
&lt;br /&gt;

== Challenging Environments ==
=== Global Distribution ===
==== Explain the global distribution of each of the two kinds of extreme environment ====
===== The distribution of cold and high-altitude environments =====
[[Image:Oblique_rays_02_Pengo.svg|thumb|350px|right]]
Cold and high-altitude environments are generally found along constructive plate margins, where fold mountains form, or polar regions. Mountainous regions have a high elevation, where atmospheric pressure is lower which causes lower temperatures. The sun's rays are received more easily however more solar radiation is reflected due to the high reflectivity of snow. At higher latitudes less heat penetrates the atmosphere as it is thicker and spread across a greater area.
===== The distribution of hot, arid environments =====
[[Image:Earth_Global_Circulation.jpg|thumb|right]]
Hot, arid environments are found in the  tropics. These areas receive direct sunlight in summer and winter. Hadley cells in the atmosphere also cause aridity as the warm moist air rises from the equator. This condenses and precipitates and the cooler air sinks over the tropical latitudes. The air is drier as cool air cannot hold as much moisture. The air then heats as it spreads over tropical regions and rises again. Hot, arid climates can also be found in rain shadows, mountainous regions with arid areas behind them. The mountains cause relief rainfall and then the dry air blows across the landscape drying it out.

====Describe the relief and climatic characteristics that make these environments extreme. Explain how these characteristics present challenges for resource development and human habitation. ====

A periglacial environment is a place where the temperature is seasonally below the freezing point. but never covered by ice. They have a layer of permafrost on or below the surface. 
Periglacial environments form where it is below 0° C for a significant amount of the year. 
These areas can be found:
 - at high latitudes, for example the northern parts of Asia, North America and Europe 
- at high altitudes, for example Tibetan plateau in Asia

__NOTOC__
=&lt;big&gt;Building Numbers&lt;/big&gt;=

One of the most familiar entities in maths are numbers. From pre-school to advanced levels, numbers are intimately linked with maths. But what are these numbers mathematically speaking? This little book builds numbers the way mathematicians build them up (at least the way most of them do now). We start from the bare axioms of set theory and develop numbers in the mathematical sense. The reader is assumed to be sufficiently mathematically mature, having been exposed at least to high school maths to understand the arguments that follow.

==The Basics==
Nothiing can be build out of nothing. Our arguments can only proceed from some unproven assumptions. We start off with a list of the axioms of set theory, using these as our &quot;unproven truths&quot;. We do not bother to focus much on logic here, rather give an intutive feel of the axioms, so that our end goal of building numbers is not sidetracked.

For those interested in a very logically sound discussion of these axioms (specifically in first order logic) the bibliography mentions books which carry further details.

1. '''Axiom of extensionality'''

Two sets are equal (are the same set) if they have the same elements.

2. '''Axiom of regularity'''

Every non-empty set x contains a member y such that x and y are disjoint sets.

3. '''Axiom schema of specification''' 

If ''z'' is a set, and &lt;math&gt;\phi\!&lt;/math&gt; is any property which may characterize the elements ''x'' of ''z'', then there is a subset ''y'' of ''z'' containing those ''x'' in ''z'' which satisfy the property. 

4. '''Axiom of pairing'''

If x and y are sets, then there exists a set which contains x and y as elements.

5. '''Axiom of union'''

For any set &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; there is a set ''A'' containing every set that is a member of some member of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. (For example if &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}=\{\{X,Y\},\{Z\}\}&lt;/math&gt; then there is a set ''A'' containing X, Y and Z. Here X, Y and Z are sets.)

6. '''Axiom schema of replacement'''

The image of any set under any definable mapping is also a set. 

7. '''Axiom of infinity'''

Let &lt;math&gt;S(x)\!&lt;/math&gt; abbreviate &lt;math&gt; x \cup \{x\} \!&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt; x \!&lt;/math&gt; is some set. Then there exists a set ''X'' such that the empty set &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is a member of ''X'' and, whenever a set ''y'' is a member of ''X'', then &lt;math&gt;S(y)\!&lt;/math&gt; is also a member of ''X''. 

8. '''Axiom of power set'''

Let &lt;math&gt;z \subseteq x&lt;/math&gt; abbreviate &lt;math&gt;\forall q (q \in z \Rightarrow q \in x).&lt;/math&gt; For any set ''x'', there is a set ''y'' which is a superset of the power set of ''x''.

9. '''Axiom of choice'''

Let a choice function be a function ''f'', defined on a collection ''X'' of nonempty sets, such that for every set ''s'' in ''X'', ''f''(''s'') is an element of ''s''. For any set ''X'' of nonempty sets, there exists a choice function ''f'' defined on ''X''.

==The Natural numbers==
With these axioms in hand we can start building the numbers. Our focus here is to quick start and build all the commonly used numbers. Hence, we wont focus on developing all properties that sets have, trusting that the user will agree that our constructions are sound enough and proofs of all properties proved strictly through these axioms do exist.

Our first target is to make the basic counting numbers, also called natural numbers. The axiom of infinity says that a set ''X'' exists which satisfies the property that it contains the empty set and the set and, whenever a set ''y'' is a member of ''X'', then &lt;math&gt;S(y)\!&lt;/math&gt; is also a member of ''X''. There may or may not exist any other such sets. Taking the intersection of all such sets we get the set of natural numbers '''N'''. Clearly it is the smallest such set. Also as &lt;math&gt;\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; is a member of '''N''', so is, &lt;math&gt;\{\varnothing\}&lt;/math&gt;, and so is &lt;math&gt;\{\varnothing\,\{\varnothing\}\}&lt;/math&gt; and so on. Intutively it is obvious that no other kind of members are there as '''N''' was the smallest such set. We let &lt;math&gt;0=\varnothing&lt;/math&gt; to match with our intuition that 0 should be defined as &quot;nothing&quot;. Next we define &lt;math&gt;1=\{\varnothing\}&lt;/math&gt; to match with our intuition that 1 should convey the notion of &quot;one-ness&quot; which a set having a solitary element does. Similarly we define, &lt;math&gt;2=\{\varnothing\,\{\varnothing\}\}&lt;/math&gt; and so on.

Hence we have mathematically defined the set of natural numbers. We will define addition and multiplication for natural numbers as follows: Let &lt;math&gt;x^+=S(x)\!&lt;/math&gt;. Then we can recursively define addition by &lt;math&gt;a + (b^+) = (a + b)^+&lt;/math&gt;. (Hence &lt;math&gt;1+1=1+0^+=(1+0)^+=1^+=2&lt;/math&gt; and so on. Note that &lt;math&gt;0^+=1&lt;/math&gt;.) Similarly multiplication is defined recursively by x×0 = 0 and x×S(y) = (x×y) + x. Such definitions are justified owing to a particular theorem in maths called recursion theorem, but we needn't go there. A few examples are usually sufficient to convince oneself of the validity of these definitions. 

==The Integers==
Once more we will take a leap and assume that the reader trusts us when we say that all usual properties of natural numbers can be established in our constructed system of natural numbers. The reason we avoid doing that here is because we wish to avoid getting tied up in formal arguments, and sidetrack our goal to provide a quick mathematical build-up of the numbers.

Next we tackle the integers. Since we need some brief extraneous concepts in our toolbox for this purpose (which all are defined and their properties established consistent with the axioms of set theory) we shall briefly mention those. First up is the concept of an ordered pair (a,b) which is defined as the set {{a},{a,b}} and using this a 3-tuple (a,b,c) is defined as the ordered pair (a,(b,c)) i.e. {{a}{{b},{b,c}}}. Similary 4-tuples, 5-tuples etc may be defined. Next is the concept of functions and relations which we trust the reader is aware of from calculus. Finally, we talk of equivalence relations and equivalence classes.

A given relation ~ on a set ''A'' is said to be an equivalence relation if and only if it is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. Equivalently, for all ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' in ''A'':
*''a'' ~ ''a''. (Reflexivity)
*if ''a'' ~ ''b'' then ''b'' ~ ''a''. (Symmetry)
*if ''a'' ~ ''b'' and ''b'' ~ ''c'' then ''a'' ~ ''c''. (Transitivity)

The equivalence class of ''a'' under ~, denoted [''a''], is defined as &lt;math&gt;[a] = \{b\in A | a\sim b\}&lt;/math&gt;. For example, if A is the set of all cars, and ~ is the equivalence relation &quot;has the same color as&quot;, then one particular equivalence class consists of all green cars. Another example deals with functions: any function f : X → Y defines an equivalence relation on X by x1 ~ x2 if and only if f(x1) = f(x2). The equivalence class of x is the set of all elements in X which get mapped to f(x), i.e. the class [x] is the inverse image of f(x). 

[[File:Relatives Numbers Representation.png|thumb|alt=Representation of equivalence classes for the numbers -5 to 5
|Red Points represent ordered pairs of natural numbers. Linked red points are equivalence classes representing the blue integers at the end of the line.
|upright=2]]
Now the set of integers can be formally defined as the set of equivalence classes of a particular relation. That relation is defined between ordered pairs of natural numbers (not between the natural numbers themselves but between their pairs).

The intuition is that (''a'', ''b'') stands for the result of subtracting ''b'' from ''a''. To confirm our expectation that {{nowrap|1 &amp;minus; 2}} and {{nowrap|4 &amp;minus; 5}} denote the same number, we define an equivalence relation ~ on these pairs with the following rule:
:&lt;math&gt; (a,b) \sim (c,d) \,\! &lt;/math&gt;
precisely when
:&lt;math&gt;a+d = b+c. \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Addition and multiplication of integers can be defined in terms of the equivalent operations on the natural numbers; denoting by [(''a'',''b'')] the equivalence class having (''a'',''b'') as a member, one has:
:&lt;math&gt;[(a,b)]+[(c,d)] := [(a+c,b+d)].\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[(a,b)]\cdot[(c,d)] := [(ac+bd,ad+bc)].\,&lt;/math&gt;

The negation (or additive inverse) of an integer is obtained by reversing the order of the pair:
:&lt;math&gt;-[(a,b)] := [(b,a)].\,&lt;/math&gt;

Hence subtraction can be defined as the addition of the additive inverse:
:&lt;math&gt;[(a,b)]-[(c,d)] := [(a+d,b+c)].\,&lt;/math&gt;

The standard ordering on the integers is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;[(a,b)]&lt;[(c,d)]\,&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;a+d &lt; b+c.\,&lt;/math&gt;

It is easily verified that these definitions are independent of the choice of representatives of the equivalence classes.

Every equivalence class has a unique member that is of the form (''n'',0) or (0,''n'') (or both at once). The natural number ''n'' is identified with the class [(''n'',0)] (in other words the natural numbers are embedded into the integers by map sending ''n'' to [(''n'',0)]), and the class [(0,''n'')] is denoted −''n'' (this covers all remaining classes, and gives the class [(0,0)] a second time since −0&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0.

Thus, [(''a'',''b'')] is denoted by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} a-b, &amp; \mbox{if }  a \ge b  \\ -(b-a),  &amp; \mbox{if } a &lt; b. \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

If the natural numbers are identified with the corresponding integers, this convention creates no ambiguity.

This notation recovers the familiar representation of the integers as  {... −3,−2,−1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}.

Some examples are:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
 0 &amp;= [(0,0)] &amp;= [(1,1)] &amp;= \cdots &amp; &amp;= [(k,k)] \\
 1 &amp;= [(1,0)] &amp;= [(2,1)] &amp;= \cdots &amp; &amp;= [(k+1,k)] \\
-1 &amp;= [(0,1)] &amp;= [(1,2)] &amp;= \cdots &amp; &amp;= [(k,k+1)] \\
 2 &amp;= [(2,0)] &amp;= [(3,1)] &amp;= \cdots &amp; &amp;= [(k+2,k)] \\
-2 &amp;= [(0,2)] &amp;= [(1,3)] &amp;= \cdots &amp; &amp;= [(k,k+2)].
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==The Rational numbers==
Next stop: the rationals!

Those who have done a course in algebra may recognize the construction that follows as precisely being the one by which an integral domain is embedded in a field. (And indeed it is no big wonder as the integers form an integral domain and the rationals a field.) For those who think fields are open spaces and are thinking about agriculture, not to worry. We provide the full construction below.

[[File:RationalRepresentation.pdf|thumb|right|300px|a diagram showing a representation of the equivalent classes of pairs of integers]]

Mathematically the construction is similar as when we constructed the integers out of the naturals. We consider the following relation between all ordered pairs of integers (''m'',''n''), with ''n'' ≠ 0. Specifically, the relation is (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ~ (''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) if, and only if, {{nowrap|1=''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.}} We can define addition and multiplication of these pairs with the following rules:
: &lt;math&gt;\left(m_1, n_1\right) + \left(m_2, n_2\right) := \left(m_1n_2 + n_1m_2, n_1n_2\right)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\left(m_1, n_1\right) \times \left(m_2, n_2\right) := \left(m_1m_2, n_1n_2\right)&lt;/math&gt;
and, if ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ≠ 0, division by
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\left(m_1, n_1\right)} {\left(m_2, n_2\right)} := \left(m_1n_2, n_1m_2\right).&lt;/math&gt;

The equivalence relation (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ~ (''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) if, and only if, {{nowrap|1=''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;minus; ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0}}  is a congruence relation, i.e. it is compatible with the addition and multiplication defined above, and we may define the set of all rational numbers '''Q''' to be the set of all equivalence classes under this relation. We denote by [(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)] the equivalence class containing (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). If (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) ~ (''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) then, by definition, (''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) belongs to [(''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)] and (''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) belongs to [(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)]; in this case we can write [(''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)] = [(''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)]. Given any equivalence class [(''m'',''n'')] there are a countably infinite number of representation, since

:&lt;math&gt; \cdots  = [(-2m,-2n)] = [(-m,-n)] = [(m,n)] = [(2m,2n)] = \cdots. &lt;/math&gt;

The canonical choice for [(''m'',''n'')] is chosen so that gcd(''m'',''n'') = 1, i.e. ''m'' and ''n'' share no common factors, i.e. ''m'' and ''n'' are coprime. For example, we would write [(1,2)] instead of [(2,4)] or [(&amp;minus;12,&amp;minus;24)], even though [(1,2)] = [(2,4)] = [(&amp;minus;12,&amp;minus;24)].

The integers may be considered to be rational numbers by the embedding that maps ''m'' to [(''m'', 1)].

==The Reals==
The Real Numbers await us!

For starters we need the concept of Dedekind cuts. A Dedekind cut, named after Richard Dedekind, is a partition of the rational numbers into two non-empty parts A and B, such that all elements of A are less than all elements of B, and A contains no greatest element. The cut itself is, conceptually, the &quot;gap&quot; defined between A and B. In other words, A contains every rational number less than the cut, and B contains every rational number greater than the cut. 

For convenience we may take the lower set A as the representative of any given Dedekind cut A, B, since A completely determines B. We now define the set of real numbers to be the set of all Dedekind cuts. In more detail, a real number &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is any subset of the set &lt;math&gt;\textbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; of rational numbers that fulfills the following conditions:
# &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is not empty
# &lt;math&gt;r \neq \textbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt;
# ''r'' is closed downwards.  In other words,  for all &lt;math&gt;x, y \in \textbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;x &lt; y&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;y \in r&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;x \in r&lt;/math&gt;
# ''r'' contains no greatest element.  In other words, there is no &lt;math&gt;x \in r&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;y \in r&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y \leq x&lt;/math&gt;

* We form the set &lt;math&gt; \textbf{R} &lt;/math&gt; of real numbers as the set of all Dedekind cuts &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt; \textbf{Q} &lt;/math&gt;.

* We embed the rational numbers into the reals by identifying the rational number &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; with the set of all smaller rational numbers &lt;math&gt; \{ x \in \textbf{Q} : x &lt; q \} &lt;/math&gt;.

* Addition. &lt;math&gt;A + B := \{a + b: a \in A \and b \in B\}&lt;/math&gt;

* Defining multiplication is less straightforward.
** if &lt;math&gt;A, B \geq 0&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt; A \times B := \{ a \times b : a \geq 0 \and a \in A \and b \geq 0 \and b \in B \} \cup \{ x \in \mathrm{Q} : x &lt; 0 \}&lt;/math&gt;
** if either &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt; is negative, we use the identities &lt;math&gt; A \times B = -(A \times -B) = -(-A \times B) = (-A \times -B) \,&lt;/math&gt; to convert &lt;math&gt;A\,&lt;/math&gt; and/or &lt;math&gt;B\,&lt;/math&gt; to positive numbers and then apply the definition above.

==The Complex numbers==

Are we done? Not quite. The set of complex numbers which the reader has no doubt encountered still awaits us. Fortunately, it does not require such a detailed development as the reals and we quickly obtain it as follows.

Let '''C''' be the the set '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of ordered pairs (''a'', ''b'') of real numbers. '''C''' is defined as the set of complex numbers. In this notation, the above formulas for addition and multiplication read

: &lt;math&gt;(a, b) + (c, d) = (a + c, b + d)\,&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; (a, b) \cdot (c, d) = (ac - bd, bc + ad)\,&lt;/math&gt;

It is then just a matter of notation to express (a, b) as a + ib. Addition and multiplication are defined naturally.

{1 MBq is equal to:
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- 1 billion decays per second
- 37 thousand, million curies
- 1 decay per second
+ 1 million decays per second
|| Correct Answer - see [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/The_Radioactive_Decay_Law#Units_of_Radioactivity|Units of Radioactivity]].
 	 
{The Half Life of 99m-Tc is 6 hours. After how much time will one eighth of the radioactivity in a sample remain?
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- 6 hours
- 12 hours
+ 18 hours
|| Correct Answer - see [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/The_Radioactive_Decay_Law#Half-Life|Half Life]].
- 24 hours
 	 
{The Half Life is:
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- the reciprocal of the Decay Constant
+ the time taken for the number of radioactive nuclei to decrease by a factor of 2
|| Correct Answer - see [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/The_Radioactive_Decay_Law#Half-Life|Half Life]].
- the time taken for the number of radioactive nuclei to increase by a factor of 2
- the Decay Constant multiplied by the natural logarithm of 2
 	 
{The Decay Constant is a measure of:
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- only the number of alpha particles emitted
- only the number of beta particles emitted
- only the number of gamma rays emitted
+ none of the above
|| Correct Answer - see [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/The_Radioactive_Decay_Law#The_Radioactive_Decay_Law|The Radioactive Decay Law]].
 	 
{If ln x = y, then:
|type=&quot;()&quot;}

|| Correct Answer - see [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/The_Radioactive_Decay_Law#The_Radioactive_Decay_Law|The Radioactive Decay Law]].
- exp y = -x
- exp -y = x
 	 
{When the Half Life increases:
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- the Decay Constant increases
+ the Decay Constant decreases
|| Correct Answer - see [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/The_Radioactive_Decay_Law#Relationship_between_the_Decay_Constant_and_the_Half_Life|Relationship between the Decay Constant and the Half Life]].
- the Decay Constant remains unchanged
- none of the above happen
 	 
{A linear relationship is obtained between the number of radioactive nuclei and time when it is plotted:
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- on a log-log graph
+ on a log-linear graph
|| Correct Answer - see [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/The_Radioactive_Decay_Law#The_Radioactive_Decay_Law|The Radioactive Decay Law]].
- on a linear-linear graph
- on a square-linear graph
 	 
{The number of nuclei which decay between t and t+dt is proportional to:
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
- the number of nuclei only
- the time interval only
- the quotient of the number of nuclei and the time interval
+ the product of the number of nuclei and the time interval
|| Correct Answer - see [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/The_Radioactive_Decay_Law#The_Radioactive_Decay_Law|The Radioactive Decay Law]].
 	 
{The Radioactive Decay Law is expressed by:
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
+ an exponential function
|| Correct Answer - see [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/The_Radioactive_Decay_Law#The_Radioactive_Decay_Law|The Radioactive Decay Law]].
- a logarithmic function
- a sinusoidal function
- a linear function
 	 
{When the Decay Constant increases:
|type=&quot;()&quot;}
+ the Half Life decreases
|| Correct Answer - see [[Basic_Physics_of_Nuclear_Medicine/The_Radioactive_Decay_Law#Relationship_between_the_Decay_Constant_and_the_Half_Life|Relationship between the Decay Constant and the Half Life]].
- the Half Life increases
- the Half Life remains unchanged
- none of the above happen

      <text xml:space="preserve">Re: Variables

Some mention should be made of Vectors as a 'type' of variable, noting that Vectors may be referenced ('my_value = my_vector[my_index]') but that elements of a vector cannot be given new values via assign() except by using assign() pnthe entire vector.

This code:

deck = [64, 89, 18];
translate(0,0,deck[0]) cube(deck);

needs to be changed to:

deck = [64, 89, 18];
translate([0,0,deck[2]]) cube(deck);

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Boolean Algebra===

Boolean algebra is a deductive mathematical system closed over the values zero and one (false and true).  A &lt;i&gt;binary operator&lt;/i&gt; &quot;&lt;math&gt;^o&lt;/math&gt;&quot; defined over this set of values accepts a pair of ator accepts two boolean inputs and produces a single boolean output (the logical AND of the two inputs).

&lt;p&gt;For any given algebra system, there are some initial assumptions, or &lt;i&gt;postulates&lt;/i&gt; that the system follows.  You can deduce additional rules, theorems, and other properties of the system from this basic set of postulates:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Closure&lt;/i&gt;.  The boolean system of &lt;i&gt;closed&lt;/i&gt; with respect to a binary operator if for every pair of boolean values.  It produces a boolean result.  For example, logical AND is closed in the boolean system because it accepts only boolean operands and produces only boolean results.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Commutativity&lt;/i&gt;.  A binary operator &quot;&lt;math&gt;^o&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is said to be commutative if &lt;math&gt;A^o B = B^o A&lt;/math&gt; for all possible boolean values A and B.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Associativity&lt;/i&gt;.  A binary operator &quot;&lt;math&gt;^o&lt;/math&gt;&quot; is said to be associative if &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;(A^o B)^o C = A^o (B^o C)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;for all boolean values A, B, and C.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt;   &lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Distribution&lt;/i&gt;.  Two binary operators &quot;&lt;math&gt;^o&lt;/math&gt;&quot; and &quot;%&quot; are distributive if &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;A^o(B % C) = (A^o B) % (A^o C)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;for all boolean values A, B, and C.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Identity&lt;/i&gt;.  A boolean value I is said to be the &lt;i&gt;identity element&lt;/i&gt; with respect to some binary operator &quot;&lt;math&gt;^o&lt;/math&gt;&quot; if &lt;math&gt;A^o I = A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\bullet&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;center&gt;&lt;i&gt;Inverse&lt;/i&gt;.  A boolean value I is said to be the &lt;i&gt;inverse element&lt;/i&gt; with respect to some binary operator &quot;&lt;math&gt;^o&lt;/math&gt;&quot; if &lt;math&gt;A ^o I = B&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B /neq A&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., B is the opposite value of A in a boolean system).&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our purposes, we will base boolean algebra on the following set of operators and values:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two possible values in the boolean system are zero and one.  Often we will call these values false and true (respectively).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symbol &quot;&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;&quot; represents the logical AND operation; e.q., &lt;math&gt;A \cdot B&lt;/math&gt; is the result of logically ANDing the boolean values A and B.  When using single letter variable names, this text will drop the &quot;&lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt;&quot; symbol; Therefore, AB also represents the logical AND of the variables A and B (we will also call this the &lt;i&gt;product&lt;\i&gt; of A and B).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The symbol &quot;+&quot; represents the logical OR operation; e.g., A + B is the result of logical ORing the boolean values A and B.  (We will also call this the &lt;i&gt;sum&lt;/i&gt; of A and B.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logical &lt;i&gt;complement, negation,&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;, is a unary operator.  This text will use the (') symbol to denote logical negation.  For example, A ' denotes the logical NOT of A.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If several different operators appear in a single boolean expression, the result of the expression depends on the precedence of the operators.  We'll use the following precedences (from highest to lowest) for the boolean operators: parenthesis, logical NOT, logical AND, then logical OR.  The logical AND and OR operators are &lt;i&gt;left associative&lt;/i&gt;.  If two operators with the same precedence are adjacent, you must evaluate them from left to right.  The logical NOT operation is right associative, although it would produce the same result using left or right associativity since it is a unary operator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will also use the following set of postulates:
&lt;br&gt;P1      Boolean algebra is closed under the AND, OR, and NOT operations.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;P2 The identity element with respect to &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; is one and + is zero.  There is no identity element with respect to logical NOT.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;P3 The &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; and + operators are commutative.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;P4 &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; and + are distributive with respect to one another.  That is, &lt;math&gt;A \cdot (B + C) = (A \cdot B) + (A \cdot C)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A + (B \cdot C) = (A + B) \cdot (A + C).&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;P5 For every value A there exists a value A' such that &lt;math&gt;A \cdot A^' = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A + A^' = 1&lt;/math&gt;.  This value is the logical complement (or NOT) of A.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;P6 &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; and + are both associative.  That is, &lt;math&gt;(A \cdot B) \cdot C = A \cdot (B \cdot C)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can prove all other theorems in boolean algebra using these postulates.  This text will not go into the formal proofs of these theorems, however, it is a good idea to familiarize yourself with some important theorems in boolean algebra.  A sampling include:
&lt;br&gt;Th1:  A + A = A&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Th2:  &lt;math&gt;A \cdot A = A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Th3:  A + 0 = A&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Th4:  &lt;math&gt;A \cdot 1 = A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Th5:  &lt;math&gt;A \cdot 0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Th6:  A + 1 = 1&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Th7:  &lt;math&gt;(A + B)^' = A^' \cdot B^'&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Th8:  &lt;math&gt;(A \cdot B)^' = A^' + B^'&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Th9:  &lt;math&gt;A + A \cdot B = A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Th10:  &lt;math&gt;A \cdot (A + B)=A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Th11:  &lt;math&gt;A + A^' B = A+B&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Th12:  &lt;math&gt;A^' \cdot (A + B^') = A^' B^'&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Th13:  &lt;math&gt;AB + AB^'=A&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Th14:  &lt;math&gt;(A^' + B^') \cdot (A^' + B) = A^'&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Th15:  &lt;math&gt;A + A^' = 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Th16:  &lt;math&gt;A \cdot A^' = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Theorems seven and eight above are known as &lt;i&gt;DeMorgan's Theorems&lt;/i&gt; after the mathematician who discovered them.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The theorems above appear in pairs.  Each pair (e.g. Th1 &amp; Th 2, Th3 &amp; Th4, etc.) form a &lt;i&gt;dual&lt;/i&gt;.  An important principle in the boolean algebra system is that of &lt;i&gt;duality&lt;/i&gt;.  Any valid expression you can create using the postulates and theorems of boolean algebra remains valid if you interchange the operators and constants appearing in the expression.  Specifically, if you exchange the &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; and + operators and swap the 0 and 1 values in an expression. you will wind up with an expression that obeys all the rules of boolean algebra.  &lt;i&gt;This does not mean the dual expression computes the same values,&lt;/i&gt; it only means that both expressions are legal in the boolean algebra system.  Therefore, this is an easy way to generate a second theorem for any fact you prove in the boolean algebra system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although, we will not be proving any theorems for the sake of boolean algebra in this text, we will use these theorems to show that two boolean equations are identical.  This is an important operation when attempting to produce &lt;i&gt;canonical representations&lt;/i&gt; of a boolean expression or when simplifying a boolean expression.&lt;/p&gt;

===Boolean Functions and Truth Tables===

A boolean expression is a sequence of zeros, ones, and &lt;i&gt;literals&lt;/i&gt; separated by boolean operators.  A literal is a primes (negated) or unprimed variable name.  For our purposes, all variable names will be a single alphabetic character.  A boolean function is a specific boolean expression; we will generally give boolean functions the name &quot;F&quot; with a possible subscript.  For example, consider the following boolean:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;F_0 = AB + C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;This function computes the logical AND of A and B and then logically ORs this result with C.  If A=1, B=O, and C=1, then &lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt; returns the value one &lt;math&gt;(1 \cdot 0 + 1 = 1)&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Another way to represent a boolean function is a via a &lt;i&gt;truth table&lt;/i&gt;.  The previous chapter used truth tables to represent the AND and OR functions.  Those truth tables took the forms:&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''&lt;center&gt;Table 6: AND Truth Table&lt;/center&gt;'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{|c|c c|} AND &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\hline
0&amp;0&amp;0\\
1&amp;0&amp;1\\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''&lt;center&gt;Table 7: OR Truth Table&lt;/center&gt;'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{|c|c c|} OR &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\hline
0&amp;0&amp;1\\
1&amp;1&amp;1\\
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For binary operators and twp input variables, this form of a truth table is very natural and convenient.  However, reconsider the boolean function &lt;math&gt;F_0&lt;/math&gt; above.  That function has &lt;i&gt;three&lt;/i&gt; input variables, not two.  Therefore, one cannot use the truth table format given above.  Fortunately, it is still very easy to construct truth tables for three or more variables,  The following example shows one way to do this for functions of three or four variables:&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">About the seventh century BC an active commercial intercourse sprang up between Greece and Egypt.  Naturally there arose an interchange of ideas as well as of merchandise.  Greeks, thirsting for knowledge, sought the Egyptian priests for instruction.  Thales, Pythagoras, Enopides, Plato, Democritus, Eudocus, all visited the land of the pyramids.  Egyptian ideas were thus transplanted across the sea and there stimulated Greek thought, directed it into new lines, is not primitive.  Not only in mathematics, but also in mythology and art, Hellas owes a debt to older countries.  To Egypt Greece is indebted, among other things, for its elementary geometry.  But this does not lessen our admiration for the Greek mind.  From the moment that Hellenic philosophers applied themselves to the study of Egyptian geometry, this science assumed a radically different aspect.  &quot;Whatever we Greeks receive, we improve and perfect,&quot; says Plato.  The Egyptians carried geometry no further than was absolutely necessary for their practical wants.  The Greeks, on the other hand, had within them a strong speculative tendency.  They felt a craving to discover the reasons for things.  They found pleasure in the contemplation of &lt;i&gt;ideal&lt;/i&gt; relations, and loved science as science.

&lt;p&gt;Our sources of information on the history of Greek geometry before Euclid consist merely of scattered notices in ancient writers.  The early mathematicians, Thales and Pythagoras, left behind no written records of their discoveries.  A full history of Greek geometry and astronomy during this period, written by Eudemus, a pupil of Aristotle, has been lost.  It was well known to Proclus, who, in his commentaries on Euclid, gives a brief account of it.  This abstract constitutes out most reliable information.  We shall quote it frequently under the same &lt;i&gt;Eudemian Summary&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The '''Thales''' Miletus (640-546 BC), one of the &quot;seven wise men,&quot; and the founder of the Ionic school, falls the honour of having introduced the study of geometry into Greence.  During middle life he engaged in commercial pursuits, which took him to Egypt.  He is said to have resided there, and to have studied the physical sciences and mathematics with the Egyptian priests.  Plutarch declares that Thales soon exceeded his masters, and amazed King Amasis by measuring the heights of the pyramids from their shadows.  According to Plutarch, this was done by considering that the shadow cast by a vertical staff of known length bears the same ratio to the shadow of the pyramid as the height of the staff ratio to the shadow of the pyramid as the height of the staff bears to the height of the pyramid.  This solution presupposes a knowledge of proportion, and the Ahmes papyrus actually shows that the rudiments of proportion were known to the Egyptians.  According to Diogenes Laertius, the pyramids were measured by Thales in a different way.  By finding the length of the shadow of the pyramid at the moment when the shadow of a staff was equal to its own length.&lt;/p&gt;

Mathematic operation on a function to find the total area under the function's curve . Given a function of x f(x) then the Indefinite Integration of function f(x) has a symbol below
:&lt;math&gt;\int f(x) dx = Lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \Sigma \Delta x [f(x) + \frac{f(x + \Delta x)}{2}]&lt;/math&gt;

Result
:&lt;math&gt;\int_{ }^{ } f(x)\, dx = F(x) + C = \int f(x) dx = f^'(x) + C&lt;/math&gt;


==Integration laws==
:&lt;math&gt;\int { \frac { f^{'} (x)}  {   f (x)} } {\rm d}x = \ln | f (x) | + c&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int {UV} = U \int {V}  - \int {\left( U^{'} \int { V} \right) }&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;e^x&lt;/math&gt; also generates itself and is susceptible to the same treatment.
::&lt;math&gt;\int { e^{-x} \sin x }~ dx = ( -e^{-x} ) \sin x - \int { (-e^{-x}) \cos x} ~ dx&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Indefinite Integral==
Indefinite Integral is a mathematic operation on a non linear function over an indefinite a boundary
:&lt;math&gt;\int f(x) dx = Lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \Sigma \Delta x [f(x) + \frac{f(x + \Delta x)}{2}]&lt;/math&gt;

==Indefinite Integral Rules==
Because antidifferentiation is the inverse operation of the differentiation, antidifferentiation theorems and rules are obtained from those on differentiation. Thus, the following theorems can be proven from the corresponding differentiation theorems:

*General antidifferentiation rule:
::&lt;math&gt;\int dx = x +C&lt;/math&gt;

*The general antiderivative of a constant times a function is the constant multiplied by the general antiderivative of the function:
::&lt;math&gt;\int af(x) \,dx = a \int f(x)\, dx +C&lt;/math&gt;

*If ''ƒ'' and ''g'' are defined on the same interval, then the general antiderivative of the sum of ''ƒ'' and ''g'' equals the sum of the general antiderivatives of ''ƒ'' and ''g'':
::&lt;math&gt;\int [f(x) + g(x)] \,dx = \int f(x) \,dx + \int g(x)\, dx +C&lt;/math&gt;

*If ''n'' is a real number,
::&lt;math&gt;
\int x^n\, dx = 
\begin{cases} 
  \frac {x^{n+1}}{n+1} + C,  &amp; \text{if }n \ne -1 \\[6pt]
  \ln |x| + C, &amp; \text{if }n = -1
\end{cases}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Personal pronouns ==

In Czech there are ten personal pronouns. Czech uses two separate pronouns for English equivalent of '''you'''. Instead of that each 3rd person singular pronoun has its counterpart in plural (while English uses '''they''' in all those cases).

Let's see the table with primary forms (nominative) of Czech personal pronouns :

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; 
!''number'' || ''person'' || ''gender'' || English || Czech || Pronunciation /[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet IPA]/
|-
| singular
| 1st
| mas., fem., neut.
| I
| já 
| [jaː]
|-
| singular
| 2nd
| mas., fem., neut.
| you
| ty
| [tɪ]
|-
| singular
| 3rd
| mas.
| he
| on 
| [ɔn]
|-
| singular
| 3rd
| fem.
| she
| ona 
| [ɔna]
|-
| singular
| 3rd
| neut.
| it
| ono 
| [ɔnɔ]
|-
| plural
| 1st
| mas., fem., neut.
| we
| my 
| [mɪ]
|-
| plural
| 2nd
| mas., fem., neut.
| you
| vy
| [vɪ]
|-
| plural
| 3rd
| mas.
| they
| oni

|-

| fem.
| they
| ony 
| [ɔnɪ]
|-
| plural
| 3rd
| neut.
| they
| ona 
| [ɔna]
|-   
|}

For declination of Czech personal pronouns and for details about them see section [[Czech/Pronouns]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Battle of Hogwarts taking place on 2nd May ==

If you watch the &quot;A Year in the Life of J.K Rowling&quot; on the special features of the DVD/Blu-Ray of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. When she is talking the Battle comes up and she says something along the lines of &quot;...which if readers have been paying attention they will know happens on the 2nd of May&quot;. Harry arrives on the 1st and speaks to Aberforth and goes to the Room of Requirement then some of the battle happens and at Midnight, Lord Voldemort gives them one hour for them to gather their dead and for Harry to go to him in the forest. The rest (L.V dying, Molly and Bellatrix having a duel, etc etc) happens on the 2nd.

:I'd have to argue whether you can tell this by reading the book, but I can't be sure until I re-check this. However, one big issue: battle is initially joined at midnight. As the school is being told that the juniors will have to evacuate, Voldemort says that they have until Midnight to hand over Harry. The later break in the action is probably around 2 or 3 in the morning, as the battle ends at sunrise, 5:28AM in Edinburgh on 2 May 1998.

Parts of this look to have just been copied from another IB revision notes site (http://revision-notes.co.uk)

e.g.:
Revision-notes -- 
&quot;5.4.1 : The circuit symbols are in the front of the data book, though I don't see where transistors or logic gates come into things...still, it's all fairly obvious. Drawing them is basically a matter of practice, not something I can really explain.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

&quot;The circuit symbols are in the front of the data book, though I don't see where transistors or logic gates come into things. Still, it's all fairly obvious. Drawing them is basically a matter of practice, not something we can really explain here. Volunteers to draw up some examples?&quot;

Should there not be citation of any sort?

:I guess [http://revision-notes.co.uk/Detailed/1096.html this] undated page is the source text you are referring to, but I think the original source was actually [http://kstruct.com/ib_notes/Topic_5_-_Electricity_and_Magnetism http://kstruct.com/ib_notes/Topic_5_-_Electricity_and_Magnetism] which appears to date from September 2005. Section 1 [[IB_Physics/Physics_and_Physical_Measurement|Physics and Physical Measurement]] contains a citation, and arguably more like this should be added unless your source was earlier, which seems unlikely and difficult to prove.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Initialization''' is the first stage that a computer program performs to prepare itself for operation. A computer programmer may use a basic template that contains the initialization code for the program.

== Stages of initialization ==

The initialization stage of a program includes:

* [[/Population of variables with default values/]]
* [[/Preliminary system checks/]]
* [[/Interpretation of command line parameters/]]
* [[/Consideration of the environment/]]
* [[/Processing of the configuration files/]]
* [[/Memory and resource reservation/]]
* [[/Service registration/]]
* [[/Secondary system checks/]]
* [[/Freeing the initialization code segment/]]

== Procedural programming languages ==

For a procedural programming language, the initialization code usually follows the declaration headers, or at the beginning of the main startup function or within constructor blocks, depending on the programming language being used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In sociology, '''sociological perspectives, theories, or paradigms''' are complex frameworks used to analyze and explain objects of social study. They facilitate organizing sociological knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Craig J. Calhoun|title=Classical sociological theory|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6mq-H3EcUx8C&amp;pg=PA1|accessdate=2 March 2011|year=2002|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9780631213482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sociological theory is constantly evolving, and can never be presumed to be complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002&quot;/&gt;

Theory is informed by epistemological discussions as to the most reliable and valid social research methods to use in the conduct of social science. Perspectives also relate to core assumptions regarding the ontological nature of the social world. Theory is thus informed by historical debates over positivism and antipositivism, debates over the primacy of structure and agency, as well as debates relating to other fundamental key concepts in the social sciences and humanities in general (e.g. materialism, idealism, determinism, dialecticism, modernity, globalization, postmodernity, and so on).

==Sociological theory vs. social theory==
Sociological theory is different from social theory. Social theory focuses on commentary and critique of modern society rather than explanation, and its goals are intensively political.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allan2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth Allan|title=Contemporary social and sociological theory: visualizing social worlds|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mf2BxB149KsC&amp;pg=PR10|accessdate=2 March 2011|date=24 March 2006|publisher=Pine Forge Press|isbn=9781412913621|pages=10–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent social theorists include Jürgen Habermas, Pierre Bourdieu, Anthony Giddens, Erving Goffman, Michel Foucault, Dorothy Smith, Alfred Schutz, Jeffrey Alexander, and Jacques Derrida.&lt;ref name=sanderson&gt;Sanderson, SK (2006). &quot;Reforming theoretical work in sociology: A modest proposal&quot;.  Perspectives  (1360-3108), 28  (2), p.  1.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sociological theory, on the other hand, is centered on the attempt to understand the society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allan2006&quot;/&gt; Whereas sociological theory relies heavily on the scientific method, is objective, and does not presume to judge the society, social theory is closer to philosophy, more subjective, and is much more likely to use the language of values and judgment, referring to concepts as &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot;.&lt;ref name=sanderson/&gt; Prominent sociological theorists include Talcott Parsons, Robert K. Merton, Randall Collins, James Samuel Coleman, Peter Blau, Immanuel Wallerstein, George Homans, Harrison White, Theda Skocpol, Gerhard Lenski, Pierre van den Berghe and Jonathan H. Turner.&lt;ref name=sanderson/&gt;

Blurry boundaries affect social science, and there are prominent scholars who could be seen as being in between social and sociological theories, such as Harold Garfinkel, Herbert Blumer, and Claude Lévi-Strauss.&lt;ref name=sanderson/&gt;

==Development of sociological theory==
Sociological theory is constantly evolving, and can never be presumed to be complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002&quot;/&gt; New sociological theories build on their predecessors and add to them, but classic sociological theories are still considered important and current.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002&quot;/&gt;

Whereas the field of sociology itself and sociological theory by extension is relatively new, dating to the 18th and 19th centuries, it is closely tied to a much older field of social sciences in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002&quot;/&gt; Sociology has separated itself from the other social sciences with its focus on society, a concept that goes beyond nation, and includes communities, organizations and relationships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002&quot;/&gt;

Some of the key developments that influenced sociological theory were: the rise of individualism, the appearance of the modern state, industrialization and capitalism, colonization and globalization, and the world wars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calhoun2002&quot;/&gt; Those and similar developments challenged contemporary thinkers, inspiring them to question whether existing theories can explain the observed reality, and to build on them, creating alternate theories, in search for the explanation of the observed society.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
[[File:Kapsowarhospital1.jpg|thumb|Kapsowarhospital1]]
Maintaining your health can become a greater challenge when traveling abroad. The differences between your own country and your country of travel can be profound and everything from the weather to infectious diseases can dramatically affect your health. It is crucial to increase your awareness about international health issues if you plan to visit foreign destinations. Learn all you can about the health and safety issues of the countries you plan to travel too. This includes researching the health care system, common diseases, and cultural differences of foreign destinations. It is in your best interest to become aware and learn about how local members of the foreign country view citizens of your home country, race, ethnic group, religion, gender and sexual orientation. It is not only necessary to have a full understanding of common sicknesses and diseases in the region that you are traveling to, but to also know what kinds of immunizations and documentation you will need in order to travel to your destination. If you have any medical or mental conditions that could possibly require treatment while abroad, discuss this ahead of time with your doctor to come up with a plan to maintain your condition while overseas.

Remember, if you travel to a destination where the elevation is much higher than here in the Northwest, it may take you body time to adjust to the altitude. You may find yourself short of breath or feel tired more often because the air is thinner at greater elevations. Once your body adapts to the changing elevation, you become acclimatized, which means you are able to function in the new environment with less oxygen. Acclimatization can take 1-3 days.

It is especially important to know that health care globally is wide-ranging, so keep in mind that depending on the region and the seriousness of your health condition, you may or may not want to receive medical care. Information about specific health issues in foreign countries is available via the internet and more specifically through the ‘WHO’ website which provides specific health information for all the regions of the world.

==Health Insurance Abroad==
When traveling abroad, it is important to consider how you will receive health coverage. According to the website for Butler University, quite a few countries demand that travelers provide proof of medical insurance before they can admitted to a hospital. Upfront payments of cash are not uncommon. Anytime you visit a healthcare facility save all bills and receipts.
Check with your current health insurance to see if they will cover you while abroad. Some policies provide an air ambulance in the event that you must sent home. Without insurance, such a trip would cost around $10,000. You may want to seek supplemental insurance that provides better coverage while you are abroad. As with many other aspects of traveling, the best way to prepare and ensure you have the best experience possible is to do research and learn as much as you can about your insurance options.
Specific plans exist for students who are traveling abroad. Butler University lists some agencies on the page linked below. They also include questions to ask your insurance about travel plans such as: what type of coverage does the international health insurance provide? How much does the policy cost? Are there any eligibility requirements for the policy? Is the coverage valid in the specific country to which I am traveling?
An article in USA Today also specified the difference between temporary insurance and travel insurance. The latter may provide assistance with small mishaps or emergency situations, but it is designed to cover lost luggage. Some health insurance policies don't cover travelers abroad, while others require the traveler to pay for all health costs incurred in other countries, then reimburse the insured upon their return to the U.S.
Some plans are designed specifically for students who are studying abroad. The plans are often arranged through colleges and universities. The coverage can also be attained through parents' healthcare.The plans tend to more flexible to fit the variety of time period's students travel abroad.

==Personal Well-being==
When traveling overseas it is important to consider your own mental and physical health. While the introduction to new and foreign cultures greatly benefits an individual, it can also be overwhelming. People experience distress when their stress level goes beyond their comfort zone, which can easily happen with language barriers and in an unfamiliar environment. Emotional discomfort can have a negative impact on an individual’s personal relationships, academic progress, and enjoyment of their experiences abroad.

Homesickness is one of the most common adjustment problems among culture shock and depression while overseas. Feelings of homesickness sometimes begin before you leave abroad and you may find yourself feeling lonely or anxious several weeks before leaving. The anticipation and eagerness for this major change of lifestyle can initiate pre-departure homesickness, feelings that you don’t want to leave, or even thoughts of changing your mind. If you experience homesickness while abroad, confront your feelings and talk to someone about your homesickness. It is also important to make friends with the locals because they can be a great support system while you are in their country. Getting involved in projects and opportunities within the community is a great way to keep busy so you don’t think about home.

Culture shock is another common condition that many people experience when they are first exposed to a different culture. Some common symptoms of culture shock include: irritability, overeating or loss of appetite, withdraw from people, and in some cases depression. Adjusting to a new culture takes time and proceeds in different ways for different people. Some common recommendations offered to travelers are to participate in community activities, building lasting relationships with community members, exercise, work on overcoming language barriers, and to be patient.   

Sometimes going abroad may in fact magnify an existing condition– for instance, diabetes, high blood pressure, or other medical conditions that need to be monitored. It is recommended that before traveling to a foreign country, you create a workable plan for managing your mental health and personal well-being while abroad. The availability and quality of physical and mental health services differ widely from country to country. Health care systems in host countries may be different than what you are use too in their level of verification and responsiveness of physical and mental health needs. Be prepared to advocate for yourself in the event that you need health care. Be alert of your mental health, stress level, and personal well-being during your stay and keep information handy about existing resources available in your host country for assistance.

It's really important to take care of yourself and rest when you get sick. I got sick several times in Kenya and I had to stay in and rest even though I felt like I was missing out. I had to miss going out the first time because I was sick but it's important to do so. One of the other students also got sick several times and spent time in the sick room. It is also important to take care of each other. When people can't get up for meals we would grab some food and bring it to the sick person. 

Homesickness also strikes everyone at different times. It's equally important to take time for your mental health. When we got homesick it really helped to talk to each other. We told each other about our families and what we missed about home. It's a great way to get to know each other and help each other emotionally.

==Vaccinations==
It is a good idea to get an appointment set up with your doctor or a travel medicine provider up to 4 to 6 weeks before your trip. It is important to get these appointments done early because it takes time for most vaccines to become effective in your body. Also, some vaccines must be given in a series over a period of time which could take up to weeks to complete.
If your trip is in less than 4 weeks, it is still a good idea to see your doctor. Better late than never, you may still benefit from vaccines that do not take a long time to administer and information about how to protect yourself from infectious illness or injury while you are traveling. 
The Center for Disease Control splits up the vaccinations into three types: '''routine, recommended, and required'''. Your doctor will help you make a decision on while vaccinations to get for your trip, but you should be aware that not all of them are required.
It is a wise for you and your family to keep up to date on routine vaccinations. '''Routine vaccinations''' protect against diseases that are common in many parts of the world although they may appear to be rare because we live in the United States. If you are unsure about which vaccinations are routine, more information can be found by following the links from CDC below.


[http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/adult-schedule.htm Recommended Adult Immunization Schedule]

[http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/recs/schedules/child-schedule.htm Recommended Childhood and Adolscent Immunization Schedule]

[http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2010/chapter-7/vaccine-recommendations-for-infants-and-children.htm Vaccine Recommendations for Infants and Children]


'''Recommended vaccinations''' are to protect travelers that are present in their country of travel but not in other countries. They are recommended as an effort to prevent the importation of infectious illness across international borders. These vaccinations vary depending on your destination. Below you can find a list of countries to find specific information for your travel plans.

Currently the only '''required vaccination''' is yellow fever vaccination for travel to certain countries in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America. This vaccine is required by International Health Regulations.

==Vaccination Information by Destination==
It is important to be aware of specific vaccinations that you or others you are traveling with may need to get before your departure. Below are some countries that are visited on study abroad programs. In these links you can find specific health information for travelers to specific countries including current travel notices, safety and security, recommended vaccinations, and more.

==Enjoyable Eating==
[[File:Peeling casava.jpg|thumb|Peeling casava]]
One of most exciting experiences of traveling is the privilege of tasting new and different foods. Certain meals or dishes may represent important symbols or be part of significant rituals. Therefore, food can be a great way to learn about other cultures. While you will (hopefully) want to try a variety of meals and morsels, keep in mind that a case of severe food poisoning, or worse, can ruin what would otherwise be a fun and memorable trip.

Consider following before ingesting something new. If you are traveling with a group or someone who is familiar with the regional foodstuffs, chances are slim that you will actually contract some terrible disease from eating. That said, remember that all raw food is at risk for contamination. Eating food from street vendors in cities has shown an elevated incidence of foodborne illness. Seafood is usually riskier to consume, but shellfish should generally be avoided unless someone who has experienced it informs you otherwise. Ingesting tainted shellfish can expose you to ciguatoxin, which can cause diarrhea, nausea,vomiting, abdominal pain as well as respiratory problems. It is best to eat cooked food and avoid diary products.

Often, your best defense against food borne illnesses is your own common sense. If something looks are smells awful, don't eat it. However, it is a good idea to make such judgments before being served or choosing food. Marie Eaton, professor at Fairhaven College, explained that in many cultures, cleaning your plate indicates more than just a good meal. It shows respect for those who prepared the food and for those around you. Leaving food behind can be troubling or offensive in some cases. Especially in areas with increased food insecurity, the concepts of &quot;leftovers&quot; or &quot;giving the rest to the dog&quot; is incomprehensible. In addition to choosing what to eat, remember how you eat and regard the meal is significant, too.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Substance Use and Risky Sexual Behavior for Exposure to HIV

         In society, some people often act in risky behaviors when they are under the influenceof marijuana or alcohol sometimes people abuse it and when they abuse it and when they abuse substances they often take part in unsafe sex. Doll et all (1989) usually less than 5% reported that they failed to use protection because they were high. Any discussion of research on the relationship of substance use to sexual risk taking must into account the limitaions of research methods used. The ideal to engage method for testing whether any drug causes indiviuals drug is administered to an experimental group and is withheld from a control group. (crowe &amp; George 1989)

      <text xml:space="preserve">How Risky Sexual Behaviors Relate To Hiv/Aids

Risky behaviors are prevalent among America’s audacious society. Psychological and environmental factors such as alcohol and drugs are the main justifications as to many got involved in these sexual encounters. According to Doll et al. (1989) usually less that 5% reported that they failed to use protection because they were high. The following research reveals that 95% of society faulted their actions on substances such as alcohol and drug use, so that they would not have to take full responsibility for their unintelligent actions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The programming languages [[w:C_(programming_language)|C]] and [[w:C%2B%2B|C++]] do not need dedicated GLPK language bindings.  GLPK is programmed natively in C.  And C++ can normally link without problem to C code.
Moreover, there is '''no need''' to use the following C linkage construct &lt;tt&gt;extern &quot;C&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; when calling GLPK from C++:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
extern &quot;C&quot; {            // NOT REQUIRED
#include &lt;glpk.h&gt;       // C header
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Instead simply use:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;glpk.h&gt;       // C header
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
== Frameworks ==
There are as many frameworks out there as there are failed game developers.  Each time somebody can't finish their game, or the game turns out to be a flop, the developers turn the remaining source code into a 'framework'.  Fortunately, there are a handful of actually useful frameworks, and in this chapter we want to show you some that can be easily used to create a decent game quickly.  One thing you should worry about is the licence under which the framework is being published.

== LTrees ==

[http://ltrees.codeplex.com/ LTrees] lets you create randomly generated trees complete with a trunk, branches and leaves. It also features wind animations for the trees. There are some different trees available, such as birches, pines and willows. You can see an example to the right.[[File:Ltrees_demo.png|thumb|LTrees Example]]

Adding LTrees to you project requires some work, but the code for adding some simple trees with a predefined wind animation is quite short.

First you need the LTrees sources. You can download them [http://ltrees.codeplex.com/releases/view/22519 here]. Extract the file, and add the projects &quot;LTreesLibrary&quot; and &quot;LTreesPipeline&quot; to your solution (see below). The next steps all take place in the ''Solution Explorer'' in Visual Studio. It's usually located at the left or right side. Right-click on your solution, and choose ''Add -&gt; Existing Project''. Now navigate to the extracted projects and select the respective *.csproj file to add them to your project. You might need to rebuild your solution (CTRL+Shift+B) now. Then you have to add the references to your main game project. Right-click on ''References -&gt; Add reference''. Select ''Projects'' and add the LTreesLibrary. Now expand the ''Content'' item, right-click on the ''Reference'' submenu and add the LTreesPipeline reference (same procedure as above). The reference to the LTreesLibrary should now be in the ''References'' section in the main folder of your project, while the reference to the LTreesPipeline should be in the ''References'' sections of the ''Content'' subfolder of your project.
Now you need to add the tree models and textures to your project. Simply open the LTreeDemo project from the downloaded source pack in the Explorer (the normal Windows Explorer this time), navigate to the ''Content'' subfolder and drag and drop the folders ''Fonts'', ''Textures'' and ''Trees'' to the ''Content'' folder of your game project in the Solution Explorer in Visual studio.

We can now proceed to the relevant code. The following examples are partly taken from the LTrees Demo Application&lt;ref&gt;[http://ltrees.codeplex.com/SourceControl/changeset/view/22316#399426 LTrees Demo Application, Change Set 22316]. ltrees.codeplex.com, received on 28. May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;, available in the source package. The first thing to add are the LTrees libraries:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
using LTreesLibrary.Pipeline;
using LTreesLibrary.Trees;
using LTreesLibrary.Trees.Wind;
&lt;/source&gt;


We need some global variables to load and create the trees and animations. The profile variables include informations about the different trees. We also need a TreeLineMesh, some SimpleTree objects, a WindStrengthSin (this defines the pattern of the wind animation) and a TreeWindAnimator object.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;

public class MyGame : Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game
{

//...
String profileAssetFormat = &quot;Trees/{0}&quot;;

        String[] profileNames = new String[]
        {
            &quot;Birch&quot;,
            &quot;Pine&quot;,
            &quot;Gardenwood&quot;,
            &quot;Graywood&quot;,
            &quot;Rug&quot;,
            &quot;Willow&quot;,
        };
TreeProfile[] profiles;

TreeLineMesh linemesh;

int currentTree = 0;

SimpleTree tree, tree2, tree3;

WindStrengthSin wind;
TreeWindAnimator animator;
//...
}
&lt;/source&gt;
	

Two new methods are needed. LoadTreeGenerators() loads information about the trees to the Content Manager, NewTree() generates a simple tree, complete with a trunk, branches and leaves.
		
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;

        void LoadTreeGenerators()
        {
                      
            profiles = new TreeProfile[profileNames.Length];
            for (int i = 0; i &lt; profiles.Length; i++)
            {
                profiles[i] = Content.Load&lt;TreeProfile&gt;(String.Format(profileAssetFormat, profileNames[i]));
            }
        }

        void NewTree()
        {
            // Generates a new tree using the currently selected tree profile
            // We call TreeProfile.GenerateSimpleTree() which does three things for us:
            // 1. Generates a tree skeleton
            // 2. Creates a mesh for the branches
            // 3. Creates a particle cloud (TreeLeafCloud) for the leaves
            // The line mesh is just for testing and debugging
			
						
	    //Each tree was loaded into the profiles[]-filed and can be accessed with the numbers 0 to 5. They are chosen randomly here.
            Random num = new Random(); 
            tree = profiles[num.Next(0, 5)].GenerateSimpleTree();
            tree2 = profiles[num.Next(0, 5)].GenerateSimpleTree();
            tree3 = profiles[num.Next(0, 5)].GenerateSimpleTree();
            linemesh = new TreeLineMesh(GraphicsDevice, tree.Skeleton);
        }
&lt;/source&gt;


Above methods are called in the LoadContent() method. Additionally, the wind animations are loaded.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
protected override void LoadContent()
        {
            // ...

            wind = new WindStrengthSin();
            animator = new TreeWindAnimator(wind);

            LoadTreeGenerators();            
            NewTree();

            // ...
        }
&lt;/source&gt;


Lastly, the trees have to be drawn. This happens in the Draw(GameTime) method. The trees need to be scaled and translated properly. Also, we need a StateBlock to capture and re-apply the rendering states, since LTrees won't do that for us. If you leave this out, you will most likely encounter graphical glitches.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;

protected override void Draw(GameTime gameTime)
        {
            //..

            Matrix world = Matrix.Identity;
            Matrix scale = Matrix.CreateScale(0.0015f);
            Matrix translation = Matrix.CreateTranslation(3.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
            Matrix translation2 = Matrix.CreateTranslation(-3.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f);
            StateBlock sb = new StateBlock(GraphicsDevice);

            sb.Capture();
            tree.DrawTrunk(world * scale, cam.viewMatrix, cam.projectionMatrix);
            tree.DrawLeaves(world * scale, cam.viewMatrix, cam.projectionMatrix);
            animator.Animate(tree.Skeleton, tree.AnimationState, gameTime);
            sb.Apply();

            sb.Capture();
            tree2.DrawTrunk(world * scale * translation, cam.viewMatrix, cam.projectionMatrix);
            tree2.DrawLeaves(world * scale * translation, cam.viewMatrix, cam.projectionMatrix);
            animator.Animate(tree2.Skeleton, tree2.AnimationState, gameTime);
            sb.Apply();

            sb.Capture();
            tree3.DrawTrunk(world * scale * translation2, cam.viewMatrix, cam.projectionMatrix);
            tree3.DrawLeaves(world * scale * translation2, cam.viewMatrix, cam.projectionMatrix);
            animator.Animate(tree3.Skeleton, tree3.AnimationState, gameTime);
            sb.Apply();
			
	    //..
        }
&lt;/source&gt;
Now compile and start your project and enjoy some trees swaying in the wind!		

== Nuclex Framework ==
[[File:Dependencies.png| thumb | Assembly and layers of the Nuclex Framework&lt;br /&gt;''Source: nuclexframework.codeplex.com'']]
Nuclex is framework, which actually contains several features.  It is specifically build for XNA and other platforms, that are written in .NET.  The advantage of Nuclex is the independency of the different available modules.  Module simply means components like 3D Text Rendering or Game State Manager.  They are interchangeable as well as adjustable.  The programmer can mix them and take only some elements.  In fact most of the modules are so essential for games, that the use of may be only one component already helps to decrease the completion time or focus on other parts of the game.  The components are an efficient help for programmers to &quot;not reinventing the wheel&quot; and bring a solution, which can be customized later.  If a game should contain a GUI, an GamePad input, Vector Fonts or other game related features - the Nuclex Framework is the right place to look for.  

Interestingly the Nuclex Framework is part of an open source community called [http://CodePlex www.codeplex.com] founded by Microsoft. Even though the code and components are not owned by Microsoft. 

All classes and libraries are coded with complete test coverage, that includes testings of the garbage collector or memory management. As the project states, all classes have a  Nuclex is open source, therefor it can be used for projects of any kind.  The terms of use clearly state, that the libraries can be implemented in any game as long as it stays open for other users.  Moreover every game creator is welcome to join the platform and collaborate with other Nuclex coders. It is very simple to sign up for and account and become a part of the community.  According to the Nuclex community the only requirement for using the components of the framework is a solid understanding of the programming language. Besides that all of the following components can make a programmers life more enjoyable. &lt;ref&gt;http://nuclexframework.codeplex.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

Features of the Nuclex Framework:
* 3D Text Rendering
* Arbitrary Pimitive Batching
* Automatic Vertex Declarations
* Special Collections
* Text input and standard PC game pad support
* Core-Affine ThreadPool
* Debugging Overlays
* Game State Management
* LZMA Content Compression
* Multi-threaded Particle System
* Rectangle Packing
* Skinned Graphical User Interfaces

More information for each modul can be found on [http://nuclexframework.codeplex.com/ http://nuclexframework.codeplex.com/].  Since there are many different useful classes in the framework, which handling can be easily followed on the webpage, this article will only cover some solutions.  In the upcoming sections three major components of Nuclex will be explained.

The assembly of the framework looks quite complex but it is actually just an collection of different libraries that can be used separately.   The core of the framework contains basic classes for Math, Networking and Windows Forms all.

=== Vector Fonts ===
[[File:NuclexVetorFont.png|thumb|VectorFont with the Nuclex Framework]]
One of the nicest components of the Nuclex framework is the vector font creation. It actually takes characters from a .ttf file and interpolates the edges of each character.  After the interpolation all information are stored in an .xnb file, which than can be used by the Nuclex.Fonts library.  Even though in small size the text does not look as good for big fancy head lines it is a great feature.  

These Fonts can be seamlessly used on the PC or Xbox and are even faster than the SpriteBatch class from XNA.  

There are three ways of displaying the fonts.  Either an outlined text.  It basically takes the letters from the font and calculates the edges of each character for an stroke viewing.  Another way of showing the vector font is an filled way.  The technic is the same as before, but it fills the characters.  Last but not least an extruded version of the characters is available. 

First it is important to import the Nuclex.Fonts and Nuclex.Graphics and providing a VectorFont object which loads the ttf.  In the LoadContent() method you can now load the font:

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
using Nuclex.Fonts;
using Nuclex.Graphics;

private VectorFont arialVectorFont;
private Text helloWorldText;
protected override void LoadContent() {
  this.arialVectorFont = this.content.Load&lt;VectorFont&gt;(&quot;Content/Fonts/Arial&quot;);

  this.helloWorldText = this.arial24vector.Extrude(&quot;Hello IMIs!&quot;);

//.....
&lt;/source&gt;

In addition to the VectorFont we need a similar class like the SpriteBatch, which is called TextBatch. With an instance of it we can actually draw the text.  We are still in the LoadContent() method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
///....

  this.spriteBatch = new SpriteBatch(this.graphics.GraphicsDevice);
  this.textBatch = new TextBatch(this.graphics.GraphicsDevice);
}

private TextBatch textBatch;
&lt;/source&gt;

Last but not least we need to connect all the parts together and draw the text.  Of course choosing an different type of filling would deliver another result. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
///....

   this.textBatch.ViewProjection = this.camera.View * this.camera.Projection;
  this.textBatch.Begin();
  this.textBatch.DrawText(
    this.helloWorldText, // text mesh to render
    textTransform, // transformation matrix (scale + position)
    Color.White // text color
  );
  this.textBatch.End();
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Nuclex.UserInterface &lt;ref&gt;http://nuclexframework.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Nuclex.UserInterface&amp;referringTitle=Home&lt;/ref&gt;===
This part of Nuclex is a library that offers all tools for an interactive optical interface for a game or application. In any way graphical objects adaptable with scaling or positioning, they are simple to control (like state changes) and the render system is not connected.  So no interference with the game could occur. 

==== ''Why use UserInterface?''====
* intuitive and simple design
* works cross-platform (XBox 360 and Windows)
* special console UI controls
* support for different keyboard layouts
* unified scaling
* renderer-agnostic design
* skinning in default renderer (skin elements using XML files)
* completely test coverage

===== Implementation =====
[[File:NuclexInterface.png|frame|right| baseline |Simple Window with the Nuclex Framework]]

Component to create fast and easy a GUI in a game.  It is not GUI Manager for complex settings but all aspects of a typical game GUI are covered.  It automatically change sizes according the the screen and supplies a default view/skin, unless a custom specification is chosen.


Just like in any other GUI framework you can create buttons, windows and almost every other modern feature of an interface.


Before we can really start we need a basic interface.  Very intuitive that can be made by the Screen class.  Create an instance and add it to an object of the GuiManager.  The GuiManager is in charge of the window so you need to create it up front, my be in the constructor of your class.

Then as described before you can add the Screen Object and get ready for the real interface stuff. Note:  Viewport is used to make the window in a suitable size.

The last lines make the bounds of the window.  If you leaf them out, it will still appear but not as nice.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
      this.graphics = new GraphicsDeviceManager(this);
      this.input = new InputManager(Services, Window.Handle);
      this.gui = new GuiManager(Services);

      Viewport viewport = GraphicsDevice.Viewport;
      Screen mainScreen = new Screen(viewport.Width, viewport.Height);
      this.gui.Screen = mainScreen;

   mainScreen.Desktop.Bounds = new UniRectangle(
        new UniScalar(0.1f, 0.0f), new UniScalar(0.1f, 0.0f), // x and y = 10%
        new UniScalar(0.8f, 0.0f), new UniScalar(0.8f, 0.0f) // width and height = 80%
      );

&lt;/source&gt;


Lets start now with regular button. First you need an instance of a ButtonControl than add the text and finally set the bounds.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 ButtonControl newGameButton = new ButtonControl();
      newGameButton.Text = &quot;Neu...&quot;;
      newGameButton.Bounds = new UniRectangle(
        new UniScalar(1.0f, -190.0f), new UniScalar(1.0f, -32.0f), 100, 32
}
&lt;/source&gt;

After placing the button we can put a delegate to it and make it clickable.  After that we need to add the button to our mainScreen.  It reminds a lot like the other gui managers, since you simply add all objects to different components.  In this case we want the button on the desktop (basically to lowest layer of the screen.)  

Note: In the following code the delegete of the button opens a new window.  DialogWin extends the WindowControl class, later more.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 
      newGameButton.Pressed += delegate(object sender, EventArgs arguments) {
        this.gui.Screen.Desktop.Children.Insert(0, new DialogWin());
      };

&lt;/source&gt;
      

Now that we have a button and made it clickable we maybe want a new window. We can simply do that by extending the WindowControl class and add own components to it.  Adding means we attatch it to the current window or rather to its ''children''.  ''Children'' is an object default instantiated by the WindowControl base class.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
 public partial class DialogWin : WindowControl {

   //Initializes a new GUI demonstration dialog
    public DialogWin() {
      
            this.nameEntryLabel.Text = &quot;Deine Martikelnummer bitte:&quot;;
      this.nameEntryLabel.Bounds = new UniRectangle(10.0f, 30.0f, 110.0f, 24.0f);

          Children.Add(this.nameEntryLabel);
    }
&lt;/source&gt;

Finally we want to add the gui to our frame and make the mouse visible.  It is that simple to create an interface with the Nuclex Framework.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
      Components.Add(this.gui);
      this.gui.DrawOrder = 1000;

      IsMouseVisible = true;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Game State Management &lt;ref&gt;http://nuclexframework.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Game%20State%20Management&amp;referringTitle=Home&lt;/ref&gt;===
Is, as the name reveals it, a manager which coordinates different states.  Only one state at the time can be active, but it is possible to have one state on the other. The main menu, for example, puts the ongoing game besides and returns after exiting the main menu.

''Manager's interface''
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
//  Manages the game states and updates the active game state&lt;/summary&gt;
public class GameStateManager {

  // Snapshot of the game's timing values
  void Update(GameTime gameTime) { /* ... */ }

  //  Draws the active game state
  void Draw(GameTime gameTime) { /* ... */ }

  //  Pushes the specified state onto the state stack
  void Push(GameState state) { /* ... */ }

  //  Takes the currently active game state from the stack&lt;/summary&gt;
  void Pop() { /* ... */ }

  //   This replaces the running game state in the stack with the specified state.
  void Switch(GameState state) { /* ... */ }

  //  The currently active game state. Can be null.&lt;/summary&gt;
  GameState ActiveState { get { /* ... */ } }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

==General Information==
Today it is a common approach to create solutions which are an overall package for specified topic. These solutions are often called engines. Every day there mushroom new ones. For example for 3D graphics, sound, network and even for artificial intelligence which is especially for games. These AI-Engines for games solve several problems, which often appear in the procedure of creating games, like pathfinding, decision making, learning, movement, tactical and steering behavior, etc. So there are even several AI-Engines and libraries which provide some of those algorithms. These give you the ability to make your games more intelligent and challenging.

== Available AI Engines for XNA ==
=== SharpSteer ===
SharpSteer by Bjoern Graf and Michael Coles is a C# portation of OpenSteer(C++) which is an open source library to help construct steering behaviors for autonomous characters in games and animation and it is distributed in accordance with the MIT License &lt;ref&gt;http://opensteer.sourceforge.net/&lt;/ref&gt;. Its last release was in March 2008 and it is designed for XNA 2.0, but it also works at 3.1. There is a demand to port it on XNA 4.0, but the conversion has not happened yet &lt;ref&gt;http://sharpsteer.codeplex.com/&lt;/ref&gt;.
As the name implies SharpSteer's responsibility relies on steering behaviors like cohesion, separation, alignment and many more. Its actual version includes a demonstration of 200 simulated flocking bird like objects which are also called boids &lt;ref name = &quot;boids&quot;&gt;http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/&lt;/ref&gt;. In SharpSteer boids can be everything (a football player, an enemy soldier, a car) in a game. It must at least have the SharpSteer's interface IVehicle.
The most important class is the SteerLibrary.cs. It is the heart of SharpSteer which consists the main algorithms for the steering behavior:
* The alignment behavior: Move in the average direction of other nearby vehicles [[File:IVehicle.jpg|frame|200px|If there is another vehicle in the light blue area, it will affect this white vehicle.&lt;ref name=&quot;boids&quot; /&gt; ]]
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
// Alignment behavior
        public Vector3 SteerForAlignment(float maxDistance, float cosMaxAngle, List&lt;IVehicle&gt; flock)
&lt;/source&gt;

* The cohesion behavior: Move the average position of nearby vehicles. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
// Cohesion behavior
        public Vector3 SteerForCohesion(float maxDistance, float cosMaxAngle, List&lt;IVehicle&gt; flock)
&lt;/source&gt;

* The separation behavior: Move away from other nearby vehicles to avoid crowding 
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
// Separation behavior -- determines the direction away from nearby boids
        public Vector3 SteerForSeparation(float maxDistance, float cosMaxAngle, List&lt;IVehicle&gt; flock)
&lt;/source&gt; 
These 3 functions get 3 equal parameters: The float value maxDistance defines the proximity area in which other vehicles affect this vehicle. 
The float value cosMaxangle defines angular borders in which other vehicles do not affect this vehicle.
Obviously the list of IVehicle contains all the vehicles that may have the ability to influence this vehicle.
But that is not the end of the story. There are also:

* The evasion behavior: Move away from a specific vehicle.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
// evasion of another this
        public Vector3 SteerForEvasion(IVehicle menace, float maxPredictionTime)
&lt;/source&gt; 
The value menace is the vehicle that should be avoided. The value maxPredictionTime is the point of time to forecast the menace's future position.

Furthermore ther dozens of other behaviors:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
     public Vector3 SteerForWander(float dt)
		
     // Seek behavior
     public Vector3 SteerForSeek(Vector3 target)

     // Flee behavior
     public Vector3 SteerForFlee(Vector3 target)

     // Path Following behavior
     public Vector3 SteerToFollowPath(int direction, float predictionTime, Pathway path)

     public Vector3 SteerToStayOnPath(float predictionTime, Pathway path)
	
     // Obstacle Avoidance behavior
     public Vector3 SteerToAvoidObstacle(float minTimeToCollision, IObstacle obstacle)
	
     // avoids all obstacles in an ObstacleGroup
     public Vector3 SteerToAvoidObstacles&lt;Obstacle&gt;(float minTimeToCollision, List&lt;Obstacle&gt; obstacles)
			where Obstacle : IObstacle
	
     // Unaligned collision avoidance behavior: avoid colliding with other
     // nearby vehicles moving in unconstrained directions.  Determine which
     // (if any) other other this we would collide with first, then steers
     // to avoid the site of that potential collision.  Returns a steering
     // force vector, which is zero length if there is no impending collision.
     public Vector3 SteerToAvoidNeighbors&lt;TVehicle&gt;(float minTimeToCollision, List&lt;TVehicle&gt; others)
			where TVehicle : IVehicle
		
     // Given two vehicles, based on their current positions and velocities,
     // determine the time until nearest approach
     public float PredictNearestApproachTime(IVehicle other)

     // Given the time until nearest approach (predictNearestApproachTime)
     // determine position of each this at that time, and the distance
     // between them
     public float ComputeNearestApproachPositions(IVehicle other, float time)
	
     // avoidance of &quot;close neighbors&quot; -- used only by steerToAvoidNeighbors
     // XXX  Does a hard steer away from any other agent who comes withing a
     // XXX  critical distance.  Ideally this should be replaced with a call
     // XXX  to steerForSeparation.
      public Vector3 SteerToAvoidCloseNeighbors&lt;TVehicle&gt;(float minSeparationDistance, List&lt;TVehicle&gt; others)
			where TVehicle : IVehicle
		

		
	// ------------------------------------------------------------------------
	// pursuit of another this (&amp; version with ceiling on prediction time)
      public Vector3 SteerForPursuit(IVehicle quarry)

      public Vector3 SteerForPursuit(IVehicle quarry, float maxPredictionTime)

      public Vector3 SteerForTargetSpeed(float targetSpeed)
&lt;/source&gt; 
=== Simple AI ===
Simple AI is an engine for XNA written by Piotr Witkowski and features gridded maps, a pathfinding algorithm, pathfollowing and behaviours such as find path, follow path, goto, stay in formation.&lt;ref&gt;http://simpleai.codeplex.com/&lt;/ref&gt;
Contrary to SharpSteer which specialises in steering behavior like cohesion, alignment and separation this engine focuses on various graphs and pathfinding with A*. Thus the behaviors are linked to the graphs which are represented as a grid and they rely on pathfinding algorithms.

=== XNA Pathfinding Library &lt;ref&gt; http://xnapathfindinglib.codeplex.com/team/view &lt;/ref&gt; ===
This library is a lightweight. It just offers A*, Depth and Breadth search. It works with XNA 3.1 and 4.0.  Based on its small size it is highly adaptable.

== Other AI Engines ==

http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/UploadFile/rmcochran/AI_OOP_NeuralNet06192006090112AM/AI_OOP_NeuralNet.aspx

== Your Own  AI Engine &lt;ref name= &quot;ownai&quot;&gt; Artificial Intelligence for Games by Ian Millington &lt;/ref&gt; ==
If you want to write your own engine, you have to think about its structural design. You should consider the purpose which invokes if it is a more general solution or special one for a specific kind of game. Furthermore there must be a general mechanism for the decisions which behavior is the actual one equal which AI algorithm is used. So every algorithm has to subordinate this mechanism. Nonetheless your AI-Engine's mechanism includes an interface for your algorithms interacting with your game world, because without senses(input)ther is no appropriate reaction(output). Of course there should be a connection between the behavior and the animation of your intelligent acting game objects. In addition your engine's architecture makes it applicable to extend the engine itself and their algorithms by anybody who wants to write his own behavior or who wants to install a new AI-technology. As always you should esteem re-usability, adaptability and maintainability. So the complete AI engine will have a central pool of predefined AI algorithms that can be applied to any kind of game objects for any kind of game, whether it is a shooter or textbased adventure, if the AI-Engine is a general solution.

== &quot;Temporary Guidelines&quot; ==  
Should talk about available engines (maybe not only XNA) for dealing with AI.

For instance the Nelxon Website&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nelxon.com/681/xdsk2/ Nelxon, XSDK2-Resources for Developers using XNA 4.0&lt;/ref&gt; lists the following engines for artificial intelligence:
* Engine Nine – has a Path Finding and steering behaviors included
* SharpSteer – I found a million and 1 uses for this…
* State machine-based behavior models -  Good Article, sample old..
* Steering Behaviors,  Obstacle Avoidance – good Example (in spanish)

=== Lidgren Network Engine ===

The Lidgren network engine is a .NET-based library made by Michael Lidgren. It can basically be used with every kind of .NET-Application. For delivery it uses a single udp socket and comes with classes for peer-to-peer and server-client connections. The engine runs under the MIT License, which makes it free to use. The current Version “gen3” requires .NET 3.5 or higher. Lidgren comes with an additional library that contains extension methods for some classes for a better XNA-Support. However you cannot use Lidgren for XBox games.&lt;ref&gt;http://code.google.com/p/lidgren-network-gen3/ - project page at google code&lt;/ref&gt;

====Important Classes====
&lt;u&gt;NetPeer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
NetPeer represents the local connection point. It holds and creates connections to other peers. Important derived classes are ''NetServer'' and ''NetClient'', which contain appropriate modifications for a server-client-system.

&lt;u&gt;NetOutgoingMessage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An Object of this class is the carrier for your information. To create one, you have to use the CreateMessage()-method of your NetPeer object. With Write() you can put all your data into the message. Write() accepts all primitive types and objects.

&lt;u&gt;NetIncomingMessage&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is used to hold the information about a received message. Additional to the content it says something about the MessageType, which can be library-related or data you have sent. *List of MessageTypes*

&lt;u&gt;NetConnection&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Represents the connection to a remote host.

====Implementation====
&lt;u&gt;How to get started&lt;/u&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
# Download the latest version from [http://code.google.com/p/lidgren-network-gen3/downloads/list the project's website].
# Open the &quot;Lidgren XNA Extensions/Lidgren XNA Extensions.sln&quot;-file and compile the solution.
# Copy the created .dll-files in your project folder and reference to them within your project.
# Now you should be able to use the Lidgren.Network namespace.


&lt;u&gt;How to create a Peer&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
class Program
{
    //hold the NetPeer Object as a member
    //In this example I use a server, because it is more common to work with server and clients
    private NetServer server;

    public Program()
    {
        //When initialising, create a configuration object.
        NetPeerConfiguration config = new NetPeerConfiguration(&quot;Server&quot;);

        //Setting the port, where the NetPeer shall listen. 
        //This is optional, but for a server its good to know, where it is reachable
        config.Port = 50001;
        //Create the NetPeer object with the configurations.
        server = new NetServer(config);
        //Start
        server.Start();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt; How to send a message &lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
//get a message from the servers message pool
NetOutgoingMessage msgOut = server.CreateMessage();
//write your data
msgOut.Write(&quot;Some Text&quot;);
msgOut.Write((short)54);
//send the message to a client
server.SendMessage(msgOut, client, NetDeliveryMethod.ReliableOrdered);
&lt;/source&gt;
The different NetDeliveryMethods are explained [http://code.google.com/p/lidgren-network-gen3/wiki/Basics here]
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt; How to receive a message &lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
//use local message variable
NetIncomingMessage msgIn;
//standard receive loop - loops through all received messages, until none is left
while ((msgIn = server.ReadMessage()) != null)
{
    //create message type handling with a switch
    switch (msgIn.MessageType)
    {
        case NetIncomingMessageType.Data:
            //This type handles all data that have been send by you.
            break;
        //All other types are for library related events (some examples)
        case NetIncomingMessageType.DiscoveryRequest:
            //...
            break;
        case NetIncomingMessageType.ConnectionApproval:
            //...
            break;
                    
    }
    //Recycle the message to create less garbage
    server.Recycle(msgIn);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
A description for all MessageTypes can be found [http://code.google.com/p/lidgren-network-gen3/wiki/IncomingMessageTypes here]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;How to connect to a server&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xnamag.de/article.php?aid=19#chapter3 - article about connections between server and clients&lt;/ref&gt;
The first step is to enable three specific message types.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
//for the server
serverConfig.EnableMessageType(NetIncomingMessageType.ConnectionApproval);
serverConfig.EnableMessageType(NetIncomingMessageType.DiscoveryRequest);
//for the client
clientConfig.EnableMessageType(NetIncomingMessageType.DiscoveryResponse);
&lt;/source&gt;

After initialising the client you can search for the server. Therefore you can send a request to an ip address or search all systems in your local network.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
//search in local network at port 50001
client.DiscoverLocalPeers(50001);
&lt;/source&gt;

The server has now received a DiscoveryRequest which has to be handled by the &quot;receive message loop&quot;
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
case NetIncomingMessageType.DiscoveryRequest:
    NetOutgoingMessage msg = server.CreateMessage();
    //add a string as welcome text
    msg.Write(&quot;Hellooooo Client&quot;);
    //send a response
    server.SendDiscoveryResponse(msg, msgIn.SenderEndpoint);
    break;
&lt;/source&gt;

The Client has now received a DiscoveryRequest by the server. Assuming there is just one server in your local network you can simply connect to it.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
case NetIncomingMessageType.DiscoveryResponse:
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Server answered with: {0}&quot;, msgIn.ReadString());
    client.Connect(msgIn.SenderEndpoint);
    break;
&lt;/source&gt;

The last step is to receive the ConnectionApproval message at the server and to approve the connection.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
case NetIncomingMessageType.ConnectionApproval:
    msgIn.SenderConnection.Approve();
    break;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Raknet  ===
RakNet is a library with several classes to perform networking solutions and developed by Jenkins Software LL.  It is a cross-platform for C++ and C#. Therefore it can be used on all major platforms, including Android and iOS. Main features are object replication, lobby system, secure connections, voice communication and an autopatcher.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Swig ====
Swig can be used to generate wrapper code for a native DLL allowing to use RakNet in C#.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/raknet/manual/swigtutorial.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Swing generates CXX and .h files that represent the interfaces as well as inclusions for the C# project to connect to the DLL.  How to use Swig see the [http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/raknet/manual/swigtutorial.html detailed description].


====Important Classes====
===== RakPeerInterface =====
Even though RakPeerInterface is not an actual class it is the main interface for the network communications and the responsible for the startup. An instance of a peer is return by calling the ''.GetInstance()'' method. &lt;ref name =&quot;RakNetDoxy&quot;&gt;http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/raknet/manual/Doxygen/&lt;/ref&gt;

===== SocketDescriptor =====
An instance describes the local socket which can be used for the startup.&lt;ref name=&quot;RakNetDoxy&quot; /&gt; It is possible to define the port with parameters or use 0 to automatically pic a free port.  In addition if desired an array of socket descriptors can be made. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/raknet/manual/startup.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Packet =====
It represents a message from another system/computer and contains information about the message, such as length, bit size or id of sender.

==== Implementation ====
=====Connection as Client===== &lt;ref&gt;http://txcom2003.wordpress.com/2011/05/29/unity-3d-and-raknet-4/&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
using UnityEngine;
using System;
using System.Collections;
using RakNet;

public class ConnectClient {
      public static string remoteIP = “127.0.0.1″;
      RakPeerInterface myClient;
      SocketDescriptor scktDist;
      //…
      void Awake() {
            myClient = RakPeerInterface.GetInstance();
            scktDist = new SocketDescriptor();
            //  Prameters: 1) max. number of connection 2) SocketDescriptor to specifie ports/addresses
            myClient.Startup(1,scktDist,1);
      }
      void OnGUI(){
      //…
      // if not yet connected
      myClient.Connect(remoteIP, 25000, “”,0);
      //…
      }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

===== Connection as Server=====&lt;ref  name=&quot;Impl&quot;&gt;http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/raknet/manual/detailedimplementation.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Starting a server is very similar to the instructions above.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;

public class ConnectServer  {
      public static string remoteIP = “127.0.0.1″;

      public static int maxConnectionsAllowed = 4:
      public static int maxPlayersPerServer = 10;

      RakPeerInterface server;
      SocketDescriptor scktDist;
      //…
      void Awake() {
            server = RakPeerInterface.GetInstance();
            scktDist = new SocketDescriptor();
            server.Startup(maxConnectionsAllowed, 30, scktDist, 1);
            server.SetMaximumIncomingConnections(maxPlayersPerServer);
      }

}
&lt;/source&gt;

===== Reading of Packets=====&lt;ref  name=&quot;Impl&quot; /&gt;
Remarks, Ii a packet is 0 nothing is to read.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public class PackageReading  {

      RakPeerInterface server;
      Packet p;
      //…
      void Reading() {

            while (true) {
                  if (p = server.Receive()) {
                             // do something terribly interesting with p...
                  }
            }

      }

}
&lt;/source&gt;

===== Sending of Packets=====&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/raknet/manual/creatingpackets.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Remarks, it is used BitStreams to create the &quot;packets&quot;.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public class PackageReading  {

      RakPeerInterface peer;
      Packet p;
      //…
      void Sending() {
            MessageID useTimeStamp; // Assign this to ID_TIMESTAMP
            Time timeStamp; // Put the system time in here returned by GetTime()
            MessageID typeId; // This will be assigned to a type I've added after            ID_USER_PACKET_ENUM, lets say ID_SET_TIMED_MINE
            useTimeStamp = ID_TIMESTAMP;
            timeStamp = GetTime();
            typeId=ID_SET_TIMED_MINE;

            BitStream message = new BitStream();
            message.Write(useTimeStamp);
            message.Write(timeStamp);
            message.Write(typeId);

            message.Write(&quot;Hallo&quot;,5);

            peer = Send(BitStream * bitStream,HIGH_PRIORITY,RELIABLE,0,UNASSIGNED_SYSTEM_ADDRESS,true);
      }

}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Network and Peer-to-Peer ==

well, I will do that. - project79

__NOTOC__
=== Basics ===
One very important point is: decide for or against networking support of your game right from the beginning. Due to some horrible stuff like bandwith, latency, packet loss and also all these together, you can't send just your input over the wire. There will be failures you have to hide before the player. Why, which failures and how will be mentioned later. First there is some theory on games and networks.&lt;br/&gt;
==== Game Types ====
==== Network architectures ====
===== Peer-to-Peer =====
[[File:P2P-network.svg|thumb|right|A typical Peer-to-Peer architecture]]
Most people think on illegal stuff hearing peer-to-peer - or short p2p. But it isn't illegal. It's only a way of organizing a network.&lt;br /&gt;
Here every machine (called peer) knows every other or at least every other peer it wants to communicate with. Thus one peer can directly communicate with another which is faster than the client/server approach. Also you don't have one machine with the need of a lot of bandwith. But temper the wind to the shorn lamb. The peer with the poorest bandwith determines the speed for all other peers (for the connections with him). (Everybody is connected to everyone. Thus the download of B is the same as the upload of A)&lt;br /&gt;
If every peer is equal, nobody has more than the others, also the logic. So everybody is calculating his part of the world and therefore cheating is easy - nobody (can) controls you. Another disadvantage is the way of finding other peers. The player can't type in 10 IP-Addresses and you can't scan the whole net.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peer-to-peer further reading at Wikipedia]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===== Client/Server =====
[[File:Server-based-network.svg|thumb|right|A typical Client/Server architecture]]
This is the typical network architecture in the net. Here every machine (client) is connected to one machine (the server) in the middle. Normally the flow of information is that the clients are sending there input to the server, which computes the results and send them back. So the logic is on one central point and can't be manipulated by a player. Therefore cheating is hard. There is also the advantage of creating a gamesession, because the clients only need the address of one machine.&lt;br /&gt;
But there are also cons. Due to everybody is communicating via the server, the bandwithload is much higher on this machine. Also this machine should be more powerful. Another point is latency. Every message has to be passed by the server, which leads to a longer distance and more time for delivery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model further reading at Wikipedia]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===== Hybrid =====
Like hybrids always are, there are somehow both. Here client/server and p2p. Following two interesting kinds are mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first deals with the problem of finding other peers. Somehow you need a central point like the server. So why not using one? One player starts a multiplayer session and in background a little server. The others only joins a session. Maybe they type in the IP of the first player or in a LAN the game looks for the server. Having found the server and set a flag for being ready, the IPs of all clients and some initializing stuff (the map, rules for this session) are shared. Now ervery client could address every other client. Thus the server is stopped, the network becomes p2p and the game starts.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
The second deals with the problem of cheating. Due to every peer having the whole logic (and using it) there is no authority machine which could say that the conclusion of A is wrong. But having one big authority machine controlling the logic, would be client/server, which maybe is impossible for bandwith reasons. So split up the logic (for important parts) in small independent parts and distribute them on the peers. Thus A controls the teamflag, while B controls something else and so on.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

__NOTOC__
=== Techniques ===
==== Limits ====
===== Bandwith =====
There are typical 12 to 250 kilobytes per second available. But the recommendation is to use only 8 kilobytes per second. That is the bandwith 99% of the user have (data collection during Halo 3 beta (2007)&lt;ref&gt;some parts can be found here on slide 18 and 20 [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyId=E031C413-43F1-4C9E-92D2-7CDD64864D02&amp;displaylang=en Networking, Traffic Jams, and Schrödinger's Cat]&lt;/ref&gt; (median for up is 44 and downstream 42)&lt;br /&gt;
So why only that little?&lt;br /&gt;
Services providers always want to sell their products. Even on good moments you wont have the full power which is written on your contract. The bandwith is influenced by the numbers of people online, your distance to the router, the activity of the others and so on. And maybe your teammate hasn't a good connection. But his upload is your download and vice versa. That is also the reason for the upstream being similar to the downstream.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===== Latency (one way) =====
Ok. Physics.&lt;br /&gt;
We all know the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light speed of light] is 299,792,458 metres per second in vacuum. We also know that packets are send via light or electricity. But is there vacuum in these cords? No, it is fiber or copper, slowing our packets down to 194,865,097 m/s (65%). So here are some distances from Berlin to other locations and the time each packet took (theoretic and round-trip; the website-hoster are only in the near of the cities)
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! City !! Distance (km) !! calculated time (ms) !! measured time (ms) (ping 32byte)
|-
| London || 910 || 4.67 || 137 (www.proteusinvestigations.co.uk)
|-
| Pretoria || 8,660 || 44.41 || 272 (mybroadband.co.za)
|-
| Mexico City || 9,710 || 49.79 || 671 (mexicocity.gob.mx)
|-
| Sydney || 15,960 || 81.85 || 432 (cityofsydney.nsw.gov.au)
|}
So why is the measured time always that much higher? Because you don't have a direct (physical) connection to these computers. The packets have to be routed and each router needs some time to put your packet on the right line (5 - 50 ms). Also your modem adds 10 ms.&lt;br /&gt;
So a good number for latency in games is 270 ms.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

===== Packet loss =====
This issue (which is also known as &quot;bad latency&quot;) comes down to a question of which protocol you use for your packets. For Games, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UDP UDP] is the primary protocol used, but this isn't always reliable. UDP Protocol fires the packets down the wire and forgets them. Thus if a packet gets lost, it can't be found again. In real-time tests, 2% packet loss is the average latency, but for games, be ready to account for up to 10% packet loss. The possible corruption of each packet is also a distinct possibilty, along with the correct order of the stream being jumbled up and incorrect. Another protocol, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol TCP], fixes most of these issues, but is too slow to make a big difference. A good use of TCP in multiplayer gaming in in a turn-based game or another environment where latency is not a big issue.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

==== What to do ====
===== Compression =====
Whatever you are programming, one point you should think about: use the right (smaller) data type. A byte is only a quarter of an int. And matricies can be represented as a quaternion and a vector, which leads to 7 values instead of 16. Due to their overhead strings should be avoided. You could also put several booleans in one bitfield (ok, that isn't really smaller), but you putting several numbers (which aren't 32 bits long) in one 32 bit Integer (via bitshifting).&lt;br /&gt;
Another way is not to send the whole world everytime (or the specific state of your character), just send the changes. &lt;br /&gt;
Don't be too exact! Think on images, there you don't send the real value of every pixel. Besides of grouping pixels the values are quantized. So instead of sending the exact angle in radians (or degrees) turn in into degrees and round the values to natural numbers. Or you turn them into a byte if 256 different values are still enough.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Others and more XNA/C# specific possibilities are:&lt;ref&gt;Chad Carter - Microsoft XNA Game Studio 3.0 unleashed - p.561&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* if an float-value can't be greater than 1 turn it into an Alpa8 (75% less)
* if a float-value can be greater than 1 turn it into a Halfsingle (50% less)
* Vector2 ⇒ HalfVector2
* Vector4 ⇒ HalfVector4
* if a Vector3 is normalized ⇒ Normalized101010
* if not ⇒ 3 HalfSingle
* Quaternion ⇒ NormalizedByte4
* Color.packedValue
&lt;br /&gt;
===== Fewer Packets =====
Just a simple example. You have a small game with 8 players which runs at 30 fps. Each player has a position, a direction where he look at and a bool as some kind of status. Every frame you send your data to all other players. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;7 * ( 30 * ( 12 + 12 + 1 ) ) = 5.1 kB&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But aren't we sending over the internet? So we need at least three things more. 
The IP header is 20 bytes, UDP 8. That's the transport, but somehow the other computer have to know, how to deal with the package. So there is still the header of our framework missing. Live needs 16 bytes and something around 7 bytes is needed for XNA. Thus we have 51 additional bytes not storing any data.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;7 * ( 30 * ( 12 + 12 + 1 + 51 ) ) = 15.6 kB&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ok. 15.6 kB that is twice our limit of 8. If you want to send your voice via XNA you need to add 500 bytes per second for each teammate.&lt;br /&gt;
In the example we have 25 Bytes of (for the game) useful data and 51 Bytes overhead, which means that 67% of the used bandwith we have filled with “waste”. This waste we can not shrink absolutely, but relatively. If we reduce the number of sendings to every third frame (10 times per second, typical is 10 to 20 times). Let's assume we would still send our data of this frame. Hence we would send only 5.2 kB of data, but we still have had an overhead of 67% and fewer useful data. So we combine the last 2 frames with our “sending” frame. To make it easier we send only the whole position and direction of us in every of these frames – better would be to send the position of the first frame and for the second and third in smaller datatypes (the same for the direction).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;7 * ( 10 * ( 3 * ( 12 + 12 + 1) + 51 ) ) = 8.6 kB&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
75 bytes useful data vs. 51 bytes overhead means only 40% waste with exactly the same data. Sounds great and we are still sending our whole world to everyone uncompressed.
Just a comparison of roundtrips. First I ping my website with a packet size of 5250 Bytes, afterwards I use 15960 Bytes. See the results:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!   !! minimum !! maximum !! average
|-
| 5250 Bytes || 110 || 255 || 140
|-

I think I haven't to explain, that more data also mean more latency.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===== Don't send unneeded data =====
Think about these questions:
* To whom I have to talk during the game?
* Does I have to know what is behind me?
* In which direction bounce the dust particles?
* Where are which star?
* Need Linus to know which boots I wear or where I look at?
* ...
Ok. About some thinks you will have lost some thoughts and on others maybe only a „What the ….“ The last type of question you can forget, if you still have in mind, that not every client have to have the same world, but one which is similar enough to the other ones. The rest should be prioritizes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
===== Prediction &amp; Smoothing =====
This is not that easy in a lot of cases. But the underlying thought is. Playing your game, it already has some data of your teammates. Even if they are from the past, you can combine them to compute their way of moving. This is prediction, smoothing now deals with the failures which has been made. Because showing the original position instead of the prediction when there are a new packet isn't that nice (the avatar would jump). That's why it is so difficult.&lt;br /&gt;
But you can make it a little bit easier by separating the physic state of an object from the rest of its states and put it (with all stuff the physicsimulation needs) in a nested helper structure. Also send more data for the simulation. More (and the right) data leads to a better prediction. Thus the data has to be send less frequently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Due to the fact, that the position of an enemy is only a prediction or a smoothing of it and &quot;reality&quot; the player can't really rely that his enemy is where he sees him – remember we live in parallel worlds where some things are known to be different and others are only guessed. So when you throw a book to a specific position, the other guy could be a little bit to the left in his world and so you miss him. Therefore it is better throw at this guy and let your computer compute whether you hit him or not - and how you missed him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You  also have to hide the roundtriptime to the server (or other peers) responding on the players behaviour. That is easy, hide it with an animation. Let the character say something or let him look around like searching the path. You can also use it to be in sync with other players.

== Split-Screen ==
The simplest way to create a multiplayer game is the split screen.  For two players that means that the screen (TV) is split in half (vertically or horizontally) and one displays the view for player one, and the other the view for player two.  Since you can connect up to four gamepads to an XBox, hypothetically, up to four players could play this way.

== 3D Engines ==
Examples for engines allowing to simplify creation of 3D games.  Should include a short intro of the engine, its capabilities, its support, maybe example projects that use it.  Example for 3D engines can be found here: http://forums.create.msdn.com/forums/t/12882.aspx

=== QuickStart Engine ===
[[File:Quickstartexample.png|right|400px]]
QuickStart Engine is a 3D Game Engine for XNA that allows developers to get started with 3D game programming as quickly as possible.&lt;ref&gt;http://quickstartengine.codeplex.com/ - homepage of project&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The current version is 0.262. It is still in an beta state. The Engine is published under the [[Wikipedia:Microsoft_Public_License|Ms-PL]], which makes it free to use.&lt;br /&gt;
Includes a physics engine, in-game GUI framework, shadow mapping, normal mapping, multi-texture splatting for terrain, and more.

==== Pre-Requirements ====
* Visual Studio 2010
* XNA Game Studio 4.0

==== How to get started ====
[[File:QuickStartSchema.png|thumb|schema]]
The concept of the QuickStart Engine is easy to understand.&lt;br /&gt;
A '''game''' is made out of scenes. Those scenes are stored in the '''SceneManager''', which is part of the game class &quot;QSGame&quot;. The SceneManager is responsible for loading and holding the current scene.&lt;br /&gt;
A '''scene''' is made out of entities. Every object in a scene is an entity! It can be a camera, terrain, light, player and anything else.&lt;br /&gt;
An '''entity''' only contains basic information like position and rotation. To give it something like a model or camera you have to add Components.&lt;br /&gt;
'''Components''' are bound to entities and are responsible for things like holding the model, handling input or emitting light.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Another important fact is that each entity has to be added manually to the SceneManager of your game!&lt;br /&gt;
The engine has also a message system, which allows every part of the game to send and listen to requests. Those requests can include things like a change of the current camera an input or a movement.
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;How to implement the Engine in your Project&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
# Go to http://quickstartengine.codeplex.com/ and download the latest version (this tutorial is based on V0.26).
# As you may wish to make changes to the engine (mind the licence!) you should copy the folder &quot;QuickStart Engine v0.26\framework\code&quot; into your project folder.
# For a better understanding rename &quot;code&quot; to something like &quot;QS&quot; or &quot;QuickStart&quot;
# Now open your projects solution file with VS2010
# Open the Solutions-Explorer, right-click your solution and click &quot;add existing project&quot;.
# Depending on the platform you are planning to program for, choose from each folder in &quot;QS&quot; the csproj/vsproj-file (if there is no specific Windows/XBox project file take the general one.
# Now do the following in your XNA project
## Go to '&lt;yourXnaGame&gt; -&gt; references' and add references to all projects of your solution
## In the references at 'Content' add &quot;QuickStart_&gt;Windows/XBox&gt;&quot; and &quot;QuickStart.ContentPipeline&quot;
# In your Game.cs ...
## add &quot;using QuickStart;&quot;
## make your game to a subclass of QSGame.

'''Et voilá!''' Your game is now based on the QuickStart Engine!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;How to Create a Scene:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While the game gets initialised all scenes have to be created and added to the SceneManager. You have to do that in the LoadContent method of your game.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
protected override void LoadContent()
{
    base.LoadContent();
    //create and load all scenes here
    Scene newScene = new PlayScene(this);
    Scene anotherScene = new AnotherScene(this);

    this.SceneManager.LoadScene(newScene, true);
    this.SceneManager.LoadScene(anotherScene, true);
    //choose the currently active Scene
    this.SceneManager.ActiveScene = newScene;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When a scene gets initialized it can load everything it might need later, including models, textures, images, etc. Although, assets can be loaded at any time if you'd like.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

'''UPDATE:''' It should be noted that loading entities into your scene has been greatly simplified since this review was originally done. Here's documentation on how to load entities and components without using any C# code, you can now define your entities entirely from XML. http://quickstartengine.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=Creating%20Entities%20and%20Components%20with%20XML
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;How to Create a Terrain:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This one is a bit tricky.&lt;br /&gt;
Make sure to have in your Content folder a &quot;Material\Terrain.qsm&quot;. The best is to get the file from the test project, which came with the engine. You can find it at this path: &quot;QuickStart Engine v0.22\framework\test\QuickStartSampleGame\Content\Material&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
When you have added the file to the Project, you might have to change the Importer and Processor in Properties to &quot;QuickStart Material Importer/Processor&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
We'll have another look at this file later.&lt;br /&gt;
To create a terrain you will need a grey scale [[Wikipedia:Heightmap|heightmap]]. It has to be quadratic and the length of a side must be a power of 2 (2,4,8,16,32,64,...).&lt;br /&gt;
Now it is quite easy to create the terrain in a scene:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
//create Terrain
Terrain terrain = new Terrain(game, QuickStart.Graphics.LOD.High);
terrain.Name = &quot;MyTerrain&quot;;

//set the elevation strength and load the heigtmap
terrain.ElevationStrength = 75;
terrain.Initialize(&quot;./Images/heightmap&quot;, 1, 4);

//add physic to terrain
PhysicsComponent tf = new PhysicsComponent(terrain, terrain.heightData, terrain.ScaleFactor);
//add the terrain (which is derived from BaseEntity) to the SceneManager of your game
game.SceneManager.AddEntity(terrain);
}
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now there is only one thing missing! You have to add a texture map for your terrain. This map has to be of the same size as the height map and uses three colors to define the textures for the ground.
 red   (255,0,0) = rocks
 green (0,255,0) = grass
 blue  (0,0,255) = water 
Have a closer look at the &quot;Terrain.qsm&quot;. You will find a path for the &quot;TEXTURE_MAP&quot;. Change it to where ever you put your image. To create the map you can use any [[Wikipedia:Image_processing|image processing]] software. Save it in a lossless format like &quot;png&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;How to create an Entity:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Everything in your scene is derived from BaseEntity. Whenever you want to create an object you have to start by creating a BaseEntity-object.&lt;br /&gt;
The entity for itself is nothing visible. You have to add a RenderComponent where you set the model and a material. In case you want collision detection and/or physics for your entity you can add a PhysicsComponent. Here is an example for a simple sphere.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
//BaseEntity(your game,position, rotation, scale)
BaseEntity sphere = new BaseEntity(this.game, new Vector3(500, 100, 510), Matrix.Identity, 5f);
sphere.Name = &quot;sphere&quot;;
//RenderComponent(parent object, path to model, path to material)
RenderComponent r = new RenderComponent(sphere, &quot;Models/unit_sphere&quot;, &quot;Material/SimpleColored&quot;);
r.modelColor = Color.Orange;
(((Physicscomponent(parent object, type of collider, density, reacts to forces)
PhysicsComponent p = new PhysicsComponent(sphere, ShapeType.Sphere, 5,true);
//add the entity to your games SceneManager
game.SceneManager.AddEntity(sphere);
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;u&gt;How to add a third person Camera:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Every object can be used as a camera, which is useful for things like first person views or security cameras.&lt;br /&gt;
For the third person view we need a new BaseEntity and add a CameraComponent to it. We also add the ArcBallCameraInputComponent to it, which allows us to rotate the camera later. After this you have to add the camera to the SceneManager, because we have to send some messages, which will just work, when the camera is already known by the game.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
BaseEntity cam = new BaseEntity(game,new Vector3(20,0,20),Matrix.Identity,1);
//CameraComponent(object, Field of View,screen width, screen height, near plane, far plane) 
CameraComponent camComp = new CameraComponent(cam, 60f, game.Settings.Resolution.X, game.Settings.Resolution.Y, 0.5f, 1000);
//add the input component
ArcBallCameraInputComponent thirdPersonCam = new ArcBallCameraInputComponent(cam);

game.SceneManager.AddEntity(cam);
&lt;/source&gt;
* The first message is, to say, that this is from now on the main camera 
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
MsgSetRenderEntity RndMsg = ObjectPool.Aquire&lt;MsgSetRenderEntity&gt;();
RndMsg.Entity = cam;
this.game.SendInterfaceMessage(RndMsg, InterfaceType.Camera);
&lt;/source&gt;
* The second message sets the player object as the parent
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
MsgSetParent msg = ObjectPool.Aquire&lt;MsgSetParent&gt;();
msg.ParentEntity = playerEntity;
msg.UniqueTarget = cam.UniqueID;
game.SendMessage(msg);
&lt;/source&gt;
* The third message is to say that the player rotates with the camera
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
MsgLockCharacterRotationToCamera msg = ObjectPool.Aquire&lt;MsgLockCharacterRotationToCamera&gt;();
msg.UniqueTarget = player.UniqueID;
msg.LockRotation = true;
game.SendMessage(msg);
&lt;/source&gt;
Finally you have your camera always in a third person view behind your player!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;How to create a Character Object&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The third person camera has no use as long as we don't have a player. Most of the script you will already recognize from the examples before.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
BaseEntity player = new BaseEntity(this.game, new Vector3(500, 100, 500), Matrix.Identity, 1);
player.Name = &quot;player&quot;;

RenderComponent comp = new RenderComponent(player, &quot;Models/unit_sphere&quot;, &quot;Material/SimpleColored&quot;);
//you can set whether an object receives and creates shadows
comp.SetShadowingProperties(true, true);
comp.modelColor = Color.Blue;

//The engine already has special physics and an input component for a player
CharacterPhysicsComponent newPhysComponent = new CharacterPhysicsComponent(player, ShapeType.Sphere, 5.0f);
CharacterInputComponent input = new CharacterInputComponent(player);

game.SceneManager.AddEntity(player);

//Tell the game, that this is the controlled object
MsgSetControlledEntity msgSetControlled = ObjectPool.Aquire&lt;MsgSetControlledEntity&gt;();
msgSetControlled.ControlledEntityID = player.UniqueID;
this.game.SendInterfaceMessage(msgSetControlled, InterfaceType.SceneManager);
&lt;/source&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;How to create a Light:&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The last thing we need for a basic scene is a light.
Every Entity can emit light. Therefore you just have to create the lights settings, a LightEmitterComponent and initialise it after adding it to the SceneManager. This could look like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
BaseEntity light = new BaseEntity(game, new Vector3(0, 500, 0), Matrix.CreateRotationX((float)Math.PI/2f), 1);
light.Name = &quot;light&quot;;

LightSettings s =  new QuickStart.EnvironmentalSettings.LightSettings();
s.LightDirection = Vector3.Down;
s.AmbientColor = new Vector4(1f, 0f, 0f, 0f);
s.DiffuseColor = new Vector4(0f, 1f, 0f, 0f);
s.SpecularColor = Vector4.Zero;
s.MinimumAmbient = 50f;
s.SpecularPower = 10f;

LightEmitterComponent lc = new LightEmitterComponent(light, s);
game.SceneManager.AddEntity(light);

lc.InitializeLightDirection();
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Review ====
The QuickStart Engine has potential but it takes some time to understand what's going on. In some points it is a bit to static and needs to be improved.

The engine was updated to work with XNA 4.0, also loading of entities and components is much simpler now and can be done entirely through XML. Also other features like texture mapping for models and in-game GUI have been added since this review was done.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Specification==

From the OCR GCE Physics A specification. Tick with &amp;#10004; when you feel each part of the specification has been covered. Try not to add much more than what is in this list as it would not appear in the exam anyway. Use links to wikipedia for more depth in a topic.

# Describe the photoelectric effect.
# Appreciate that the photoelectric effect provides evidence for a particulate nature of electromagnetic radiation while phenomena such as interference and diffraction provide evidence for a wave nature.
# Show an appreciation of the particulate nature of electromagnetic radiation, i.e. a photon model.
# Recall and use E=hf.
# Explain why the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons is independent of intensity, and why the photoelectric current is proportional to intensity of the incident radiation.
# Explain photoelectric phenomena in terms of photon energy and work function energy.
# Recall, use and explain the significance of hf = Φ + ½mvmax2
# Explain the significance of threshold frequency.
# Define, understand and use the electronvolt (eV) as a unit of energy.
# Describe and interpret qualitatively the experimental evidence provided by electron diffraction for the wave nature of particles.
# Recall and use the de Broglie equation λ = h/mv

==Stuff removed from the page==

This does not appear in the specification:

=== Uncertainty Principle ===

When one uses energy to determine the location of a particle, the energy used alters the location, direction and velocity vector such that the location of the particle becomes uncertain. Imagine a marble under a table with a table cloth that reaches the floor.  To locate the marble, you are using canned air. When you hear the canned air blowing against something, you safely assume that the something is the marble.  However, you have blown the marble away from where you found it.

== &quot;just give them what they need&quot; ==

is a perfectly acceptable approach for a book that is designed to teach up to A level standard. It's not like we have to give students the entire human knowedgebase of physics, thats the purpose of wikipedia. remember that the purpose of wikibooks is textbooks that can actually be used by students, so there is no point of information that will never be of any use to them.

Also, the text that was erased was very trollish, opinionated and rude about the current state of physics education. I dont think many physics students will appreciate being told that they are learning stuff that is wrong and then being blinded by concepts that they cannot grasp because the basics have been skipped. Basically, the deleted text that was by the anonymous author didnt really contribute much to the page as a whole, it was just a rant thinly disguised as instruction. Quote: &quot;this is total crap&quot;(referring to the text above it). not very useful to throw students around like that. also check out my talk page for someone who agrees with me on the rude tone of the text. Thanks. --[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 23:38, 14 November 2005 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you get some copper wire and coil it up, and connect its ends to a small battery, you can make a weak electromagnet! To make an even stronger electromagnet, coil your copper wire around a large iron nail. The nail is induced to become a magnet (magnetic induction), and makes the whole thing stronger.

=== Materials ===
# long nail (or screwdriver, that is mostly an nail with a specific tip and a handle). Iron works best, but steel will work also.
#Roughly 1 meter (about 3 feet) of thin copper wire.
#A 6-volt or 9-volt battery. 
#Any kind of steel material except galvanized.

[[File:Homemade_Electromagnet.jpg]]

=== Steps ===
# Wrap the wire around the screwdriver leaving a length on each end for connecting to the battery.
#Hook the wire to the battery by looping the ends of the length to each battery post.
#'''Tip:''' use a cloth to hold the battery as it will get hot after a few minutes. 
#Holding the battery, bring the copper coiled nail close to the metal and observe how the screwdriver now acts as a magnet to attract the paper clip.
#To be safe and to save your battery, promptly disconnect the wire from the battery when you've finished the demonstration.&lt;br /&gt;

=== Physics ===
The atoms inside of magnets all line up the same way. In things that are
not magnets, the atoms don’t line up. When the copper wire is coiled
around an iron nail and attached to a battery, the atoms in the nail start to  
line up, too. Now the nail is also a magnet! As soon as you disconnect the battery, the nail and wire stop being a magnet. The electricity from the battery creates a magnetic field around the coiled wire and nail that acts just like a bar magnet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An ectopic pregnancy is an occurrence of complications during the early stages of pregnancy. The pregnancy occurs outside of the uterus which can lead to potential harm for the baby and mother, if not treated soon. Ectopic growths usually occur in the stomach, ovaries, cervix and fallopian tubes. When a normal pregnancy occurs inside of the uterine walls. 
:Studies show that 2% of women have an ectopic pregnancy in the United States.(Carr &amp; Evans, 2000; Lehner, Kucera, Jirecek, Egarter,
&amp; Husslein, 2000; Job-Spira, Fernandez, Bouyer, Pouly, Germain, &amp; Coste, 1999). 
Most of the time ectopic pregnancies just happen there is no specific reasoning for it occurring. There however have been reports that in vitro fertilization or IFV and STD'S have played a role in causing them.

      <comment>/* Failure to solve to optimality */ spelling</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page explains how to recover and interpret solution information from GLPK.  The information presented here should be relevant to both modelers using GLPSOL and programmers using the callable library APIs.

You must have made an attempt to '''solve''' your problem before the material on this page will apply &amp;mdash; but the GLPK solution process need not have produced a usable answer.  Answer or no, there are many reasons for seeking extra information about the solution process and/or solution.

__FORCETOC__

== Run-time reporting ==

GLPK will normally print information during the solution process &amp;mdash; the details of which can be found on the [[GLPK/Terminal_output|terminal output]] page.

== Failure to solve to optimality ==

There are several reasons (software faults aside) as to why GLPK may fail to reach an optimal solution:

* the problem is empty and the solver returns
* the solver ''proves'' that the problem is unbounded and returns
* the solver ''proves'' that the problem is nonfeasible and returns
* the solver is unable to find a starting feasible solution within the allocated time or available memory
* the solver is unable to find an optimal solution within the allocated time or available memory
* the solver encounters numerical instability problems

Not all of these conditions are relevant to each of the {&amp;nbsp;simplex, interior-point&amp;nbsp;}  &amp;times; {&amp;nbsp;LP, MIP&amp;nbsp;} combinations, but this outline does give an indication of the kind of issues that can arise.  The [[GLPK/Troubleshooting|troubleshooting page]] offers some suggestions and fixes.  Numerical instability warnings, in particular, may result from poor [[GLPK/Scaling|scaling]].  If you encounter a really puzzling problem and think it a bug in GLPK, ''please'' report the issue so it can be addressed.

If programming with GLPK, bear in mind that the solver, paradoxically perhaps, need not have found a solution to return success &amp;mdash; it only needs to have completed its assigned tasks satisfactorily.

== Solution recovery ==

Assuming that GLPK provides an optimal solution, there are several methods for recovering the solution information using both standard calls and tailored methods.  Some techniques may also accept and process non-optimal feasible solutions.

The MathProg language allows for tight control over the output of solution information.
The language now supports [[GLPK/Using_GMPL_%28MathProg%29#MathProg_suffixes|suffixes]] for constraints and variables (but not parameters) &amp;mdash; a feature that can be useful when seeking, for example, dual values.
The section on [[GLPK/Modeling_tips#Close-to-zero_values|close-to-zero rounding]] shows how to use a MathProg conditional to output true zeros instead of very small numbers.

GLPSOL offers the options &lt;tt&gt;--output&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;--write&lt;/tt&gt; for obtaining solution information in human readable and machine parsible formats, respectively.  Both may be used in the one command:

&lt;pre&gt;
glpsol ... --output file.out --write file.wri
&lt;/pre&gt;

These two output formats are presented on the [[GLPK/Interoperability|interoperability]] page.
Terminal output can also be duplicated to a text file with the GLPSOL command-line option &lt;tt&gt;--log file.log&lt;/tt&gt;.
Conversely, the special filename &lt;tt&gt;/dev/stdout&lt;/tt&gt; can be used to write &quot;files&quot; to the terminal instead of to a regular file.
And both tactics can be used together.

The output produced by &lt;tt&gt;glp_print_sol&lt;/tt&gt; is
similar to that used by the [[w:IBM|IBM]] MPS/360
linear programming package, but altered a little,
because GLPK uses auxiliary rather than slack/surplus
variables.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  |last = Murtagh
  |first = Bruce A
  |title = Advanced linear programming : theory and practice
  |publisher = McGraw-Hill
  |location= New York, USA
  |year = 1981
  |isbn = 0-07-044095-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The various GLPK API calls that can be used to recover information are listed [[#Informational_APIs|below]].  Elsewhere, the relevant function names are given to aid cross-referencing back to the GLPK API manual, where comprehensive technical descriptions can usually be found.

== Sensitivity analysis report ==

A problem solved to optimality with the '''simplex solver''' can be further subject to a sensitivity analysis.
This feature is not available to solutions generated by the interior-point solver or for mixed-integer problems.
The &lt;tt&gt;glp_print_ranges&lt;/tt&gt; API call produces a [[GLPK/Interoperability#GLPSOL_sensitivity_analysis|'''sensitivity report''']] in human readable format.  

The GLPSOL &lt;tt&gt;--ranges&lt;/tt&gt; option also produces this report (or issues a suitable warning if its use is inappropriate):

&lt;pre&gt;
glpsol ... --ranges file.sen
&lt;/pre&gt;

The output produced by &lt;tt&gt;glp_print_ranges&lt;/tt&gt; is
identical to that used by the IBM MPS/360
linear programming package (see Murtagh 1981).

The description here is intentionally brief &amp;mdash; details can be found in the [[GLPK/Literature#Official_GLPK_documentation|official GLPK API manual]], 
including an explanation of ''break points'' and ''objective coefficient sensitivities''.
The two following tables can be used to read a sensitivity analysis report.

''Abbreviations'': RHS means right-hand side. Inf means infinity.

The official documentation (GLPK 4.45) explains that analysis of a row is the analysis of its ''auxiliary'' variable, which is equal to the row linear form &lt;math&gt;\sum a_j x_j&lt;/math&gt;.  And the analysis of a column is the analysis of its corresponding ''structural'' variable.  Formally, there is no innate difference between rows and columns when performing a sensitivity analysis.

== Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions ==

For [[w:Linear_programming|pure linear programs]] (excluding [[w:Mixed_integer_programs|mixed-integer programs]]), the [[w:Karush–Kuhn–Tucker_conditions|Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions]] are necessary and sufficient for the given solution to be a '''global optimum''' (assuming that some regularity conditions are also met).   
These KKT conditions are [[GLPK/Background_theory#Karush-Kahn-Tucker_.28KKT.29_optimality_conditions|'''listed here''']] as they apply to GLPK.
Numerical solvers also use these KKT conditions to estimate the '''accuracy''' of their [[w:Floating_point|floating point calculations]] upon completion.  
GLPK can provide on request, a human readable [[GLPK/Interoperability#GLPSOL_output_format|'''report''']] giving, among other things, the KKT conditions for any solution obtained using either the '''simplex''' or '''interior-point''' solvers.

=== KKT calculation ===

GLPK provides the &lt;tt&gt;lpx_check_kkt&lt;/tt&gt; routine to calculate and interpret the KKT optimality conditions for the current basic solution.
This call fills a C struct &lt;tt&gt;LPXKKT&lt;/tt&gt; instance, from which specific information can be recovered.
Its use is documented in the [[GLPK/Literature#Official_GLPK_documentation|official GLPK API manual]] and the call itself is also [[GLPK/API_usage#Karush-Kuhn-Tucker_optimality_conditions|described]] in this wikibook.

=== KKT report ===

The GLPK &lt;tt&gt;glp_print_sol&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;glp_print_ipt&lt;/tt&gt; calls print a report which contains both the solution and the KKT optimality conditions for that solution.
The GLPSOL &lt;tt&gt;--output&lt;/tt&gt; option also displays the same information for pure LP (non-MIP) problems (usage is not restricted).

&lt;pre&gt;
glpsol ... --output file.out
&lt;/pre&gt;

The KKT conditions are most often used to estimate the effects of inaccurate floating point arithmetic on the quality of the reported solution (assuming that exact arithmetic has not been deployed).  The description given here is intentionally brief &amp;mdash; consult the [[GLPK/Literature#Official_GLPK_documentation|official GLPK API manual]] for details.  There are four reported tests, labeled &lt;tt&gt;KKT.PE&lt;/tt&gt; thru &lt;tt&gt;KKT.DB&lt;/tt&gt;.  A typical report is shown &amp;mdash; which is ''clean'' in this case!

&lt;pre&gt;
KKT.PE: max.abs.err = 0.00e+00 on row 0
        max.rel.err = 0.00e+00 on row 0
        High quality

KKT.PB: max.abs.err = 0.00e+00 on row 0
        max.rel.err = 0.00e+00 on row 0
        High quality

KKT.DE: max.abs.err = 0.00e+00 on column 0
        max.rel.err = 0.00e+00 on column 0
        High quality

KKT.DB: max.abs.err = 0.00e+00 on row 0
        max.rel.err = 0.00e+00 on row 0
        High quality
&lt;/pre&gt;

The following three tables can be used to read a KKT report.
The mathematical expressions given in the first table are described in detail
[[GLPK/Background_theory#Karush-Kahn-Tucker_.28KKT.29_optimality_conditions|here]].

The ''char'' column above refers to the character values contained int the GLPK &lt;tt&gt;LPXKKT&lt;/tt&gt; C-struct.

=== Interpretation ===

For a given problem, with scaling if operative, the GLPK 4.45 API manual states that &quot;if all the indicators show high or medium quality &amp;hellip; the user can be sure that the obtained basic solution is quite accurate.&quot;

== Integer feasibility report ==

The first two KKT conditions &lt;tt&gt;KKT.PE&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;KKT.PB&lt;/tt&gt; can also be calculated for the solution to a '''mixed-integer program''' and used to investigate the numerical accuracy of the resulting solution.  These two tests alone do not guarantee optimality, but the solver will know if the branch-and-bound tree has been exhausted or not.  See the preceding [[#KKT_report|section]] for details.

The GLPK &lt;tt&gt;glp_print_mip&lt;/tt&gt; call prints a report which contains both the solution and the integer feasibility conditions for that solution
The GLPSOL &lt;tt&gt;--output&lt;/tt&gt; option can be used to display this information for MIP problems (usage is not restricted).

&lt;pre&gt;
glpsol ... --output file.out
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note too the GLPSOL option &lt;tt&gt;--nomip&lt;/tt&gt; which allows an MIP problem to be solved as a pure LP by removing the integer restrictions.

== Informational APIs ==

The following functions can be used to collect information directly (and should be used in preference to [[w:Regular_expression|regexing]] text files):

&lt;table border=0 style=&quot;margin-top: 2ex; margin-bottom: 3ex&quot;&gt;

The following functions should produce human readable reports:

&lt;table border=0 style=&quot;margin-top: 2ex; margin-bottom: 3ex&quot;&gt;
  &lt;tr style=&quot;font-weight: bold; background-color: lightgray&quot;&gt;

    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;print human readable [[#Sensitivity_analysis_report|sensitivity analysis report]]&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;glp_print_sol&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;print human readable [[#Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions|KKT conditions]], along with the simplex LP solution&lt;/td&gt;
  &lt;tr&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;&lt;tt&gt;glp_print_ipt&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;print human readable [[#Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions|KKT conditions]], along with the interior-point LP solution&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;td style=&quot;padding-left: 10px; padding-right: 10px&quot;&gt;print human readable [[#Integer_feasibility_report|integer feasibility report]], along with the MIP solution&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

== Adaptive use ==

Several innovative projects use GLPK solution information in an adaptive context.  Results from one run are used to generate the next model, and so on, until some predetermined condition is reached.

Gender inequality refers to the obvious or hidden disparity between individuals due to gender. Gender inequality is something that has been going on for a long time. For so long we have been trying to get women on the same level as men, but somehow the fight has yet to be over. Women who do the same job as men are still put under the radar and receive less wages. The belief is that women are just as capable as men and should be rewarded for their contributions to the company by being the same amount that men do.  

Gender equality is very prominent throughout the world. For example, within the House of Representatives there are only 14 seats out of 100 that hold women. The disparity of wages between men and women is slowly improving, but there is still a gap.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The trigonometric functions can be defined for complex variables as well as real ones.

One way is to use the power series for sin(x) and cos(x), which are convergent for all real and complex numbers.  An easier procedure, however, is to use the identities from the previous section:

* cos(''i'' x) = cosh(x)
* sin(''i'' x) = ''i'' sinh(x)
* tan(''i'' x) = ''i'' tanh(x)

Any complex number z can be written z = x+''i''y for real x and y.  We then have

:sin(z) = sin(x+''i''y) = sin(x)cos(''i''y) + cos(x)sin(''i''y) = sin(x)cosh(y) + ''i''cos(x)sinh(y)

:cos(z) = cos(x+''i''y) = cos(x)cos(''i''y) - sin(x)sin(''i''y) = cos(x)cosh(y) - ''i''sin(x)sinh(y)

These functions can take any real or complex value, however large.  Nevertheless, they still satisfy

:sin&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(x) + cos&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(x) = 1

Also, it is easily shown that all the results such as sin(z+2&amp;pi;)=sin(z) and sin(-z)=-sin(z) are still true.

Clearly, sin(z) and cos(z) are real if y=0 so z is real.  Otherwise, sin(z) is real if cos(x)=0 and cos(z) is real if sin(x)=0.

Since cosh(y) is never zero, and sin(x) and cos(x) are never simultaneously zero, there are no zeroes of sin(z) and cos(z) other than the ones on the real number axis.

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(z) = \tan(x+iy) = \frac{\tan(x) + \tan(iy)}{1 - \tan(x)\tan(iy)} = \frac{\tan(x) + i\tanh(y)}{1 - i\tan(x)\tanh(y)}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Introduction to Cornea=
The cornea is a transparent, avascular, watch-glass like structure. It forms anterior 1/6th of the outer fibrous coat of eyeball.
==Functions==
#Major refracting medium
#Protects intraocular contents
==Applied Physiology==

===Corneal Transparency===
It is due to the following factors:

# Peculiar arrangement of corneal lamellae (Lattice Theory of Maurice)
# Avascularity
# Relative state of dehydration maintained by barrier effects of epithelium and endothelium and active bicarbonate pump of endothelium

===Source of Nutrients===

Solutes enter the cornea by:

* Simple diffusion through aqueous humor
* Active transport through aqueous humor
* Diffusion from perilimbal capillaries

Oxygen directly enters from the air via an active process of epithelium

=Congenital Anomalies=
==Megalocornea==
When the horizontal diameter of cornea is of adult size at birth or 13mm or greater after the age of 2 years.
==Microcornea==
When the horizontal diameter is less than 10mm since birth.
==Cornea Plana==
Bilaterally the cornea is comparatively flat in this condition.
==Congenital Cloudy Cornea==
Cloudiness in the cornea since birth due to generally 
#Sclerocornea
#Tears in Descemet's membrane
#Ulcer
#Metabolic conditions
#Posterior Corneal Defect
#Endothelial dystrophy
#Dermoids

=Inflammatory Conditions=
The inflammation of cornea is called keratitis.

==Morphological Classification==
A. Ulcerative Keratitis (corneal ulcer)
     
#Depending on location
##Central
##Peripheral    
#Depending on purulence
##Purulent Corneal Ulcer (suppurative)
##Non-Purulent Corneal Ulcer (non-suppurative)
#Depending on hypopoyon
##Simple Corneal Ulcer
##Hypopyon Corneal Ulcer
#Depending on Depth
##Superficial
##Deep
##Impending perforation
##Perforated
#Depending on Slough fornmation
##Non-Sloughing Corneal Ulcer
##Sloughing Corneal Ulcer

B. Non-Ulcerative Keratitis
    
#Superficial keratitis
##Diffuse superficial keratitis
##Superficial Punctate Keratitis (SPK)
#Deep Keratitis
##Non-suppurative   
###Interstitial 
###Disciform 
###Sclerosing 
###Keratitis Profunda
##Suppurative    
###Central Corneal
###Posterior Corneal

==Etiological Classification==
#Infective keratitis
##Bacterial
##Viral
##Fungal
##Chlamydial
##Protozoal
##Spirochaetal
#Allergic Keratitis
##Phlyctenular keratitis
##Vernal keratitis
##Atopic keratitis
#Trophic Keratitis
##Exposure keratitis
##Neuroparalytic keratitis
##Keratomalacia
##Atheromatous Ulcer
#Associated with diseases of skin and mucous membrane
#Associated with systemic collagen vascular disorders
#Traumatic keratitis
#Idiopathic keratitis
##Mooren's Corneal Ulcer
##Superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis
##Thygseon's superficial punctate keratitis

=Degenerative Disorders=
It happens when normal corneal cells undergo some degenerative changes due to age or some pathological conditions.

==Classification==
A.Etiological Classification
#Age related degenerations
##Arcus senilitis
##Vogt's white limbal girdle
##Hassal-Henle bodies
##Mosaic degeneration
#Pathological degenerations
##Fatty degeneration
##Amyloidosis
##Calcific degeneration
##Salzmann's nodular degeneration
##Furrow degeneration
##Spheroidal degeneration
##Pellucid marginal degeneration
##Terrien's marginal degeneration
##Mooren's ulcer

=Corneal Dystrophies=
These are inherited disorders in which the cells have some inborn defects due to which cornea becomes hazy with the passage of time. There is no associated systemic pathology.

==Classification==
#Anterior Dystrophies
##Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy
##Reis-Buckler's Dystrophy
##Meesman's Dystrophy
##Recurrent Corneal Erosion Syndrome
##Stocker-Holt Dystrophy

#Stromal Dystrophies
##Lattice Dystrophy
##Crystalline Dystrophy (Schnyder's)
##Granular Dystrophy (Groenouw's type I)
##Macular Dystrophy (Groenouw's type II)

#Posterior Dystrophies
##Cornea Gutta
##Fuch's late hereditary endothelial dystrophy
##Posterior polymorphous dystrophy (of Schlichting)
##Congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED)

=Ectatic Conditions=

*Keratconus: is a non-inflammatory, mostly bilateral, ectatic condition of cornea in it's axial part.

*Keratoglobus: It is a familial and hereditary bilateral congenital disorder characterized by thinning and hemispherical protrusion of the entire cornea.

*Keratoconus Posterior: Extremely rare condition. Cone-like bulging of posterior surface of cornea occurs.

=Abnormalities in transparency of cornea=
Any condition that alters corneal transparency leads to loss of vision. The most common causes of loss of corneal transparency are:
#Corneal Oedema
#Drying of Cornea
#Depositions on Cornea
#Inflammations of Cornea
#Corneal Degenerations
#Dystrophies of cornea
#Vascularization of cornea
#Scarring of Cornea

==Corneal Opacities==
This term is typically used for the loss of transarency of cornea due to scarring.

Causes:
#Developemental Anomalies
#Following birth trauma
#Healed Corneal wounds
#Healed Corneal Ulcers

==Corneal Oedema==
Normal water content of cornea is 78%. If it becomes greater than this, central thickness increases and transparency reduces.

Causes:
#Raised IOP
#Endothelial damage
#Epithelial damage

==Vasclarization of Cornea==
Normally the cornea has only small capillary loops in the periphery for about 1mm. It can be invaded by vessels leading to irritation and decreased corneal transpaency.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello everyone, before we start this project further it's better to discuss the aims and objectives of the book. There is no actual need of a full length book for medical students on ophthalmology as there are already adequate number of textbooks available. Our aim in developing this book is to provide brief, concise and relevant information on the vast topic of ophthalmology. This book is not intended for patients, for whom we recommend going to a doctor if they have a medical problem.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Systems ==

Systems, in one sense, are devices that take input and produce an output. A system can be thought to '''operate''' on the input to produce the output. The output is related to the input by a certain relationship known as the '''system response'''.  The system response usually can be modeled with a mathematical relationship between the system input and the system output.

== System Properties ==

Physical systems can be divided up into a number of different categories, depending on particular properties that the system exhibits. Some of these system classifications are very easy to work with and have a large theory base for analysis. Some system classifications are very complex and have still not been investigated with any degree of success. By properly identifying the properties of a system, certain analysis and design tools can be selected for use with the system. 

The early sections of this book will focus primarily on '''linear time-invariant''' (LTI) systems. LTI systems are the easiest class of system to work with, and have a number of properties that make them ideal to study. This chapter discusses some properties of systems.

Later chapters in this book will look at time variant systems and nonlinear systems. Both time variant and nonlinear systems are very complex areas of current research, and both can be difficult to analyze properly. Unfortunately, most physical real-world systems are time-variant, nonlinear, or both.

Having tried to learn basics of quite a few programming languages, I have got attracted towards the simplicity and robustness of the Wiki pages and hence sincerely want to learn the science of Wikipages and that too very fast.

I have a great inclination towards Linux.

Basically I want at this stage of my life(I am about 40 now), to devote most of my time learning programming languages, get certified with honourable marks and devote rest of my life in the area of computing.</text>

Many printers are primarily used as local peripherals, and are attached by a printer cable or, in most newer printers, a USB cable to a computer which serves as a document source. Some printers, commonly known as network printers, have built-in network interfaces, typically wireless and/or Ethernet based, and can serve as a hard copy device for any user on the network. Individual printers are often designed to support both local and network connected users at the same time. In addition, a few modern printers can directly interface to electronic media such as memory cards, or to image capture devices such as digital cameras, scanners; some printers are combined with a scanners and/or fax machines in a single unit, and can function as photocopiers. Printers that include non-printing features are sometimes called multifunction printers (MFP), multi-function devices (MFD), or all-in-one (AIO) printers. Most MFPs include printing, scanning, and copying among their many features.

: [[File:Photocopier-Xerox-2004.jpg|200px]]

A photocopier (also known as a copier or copy machine) is a machine that makes paper copies of documents and other visual images quickly and cheaply. Most current photocopiers use a technology called xerography, a dry process using heat. (Copiers can also use other technologies such as ink jet, but xerography is standard for office copying.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">GST may be set at 10% of GST applicable sales and business related purchases. 

Some governments make certain goods and services '''GST-free''' in order to help disadvantaged tax payers, or people who can't work due to poor health, lack of education, poverty resulting in suboptimal personal development and further relative poverty. Examples include fresh vegetables , bread, milk , meat, infant formula, eggs, cooking oil , child care services,  government funded medical services.

===== GST collections is a liability account to accrue GST on sales, and GST outlays is a current asset account to accrue GST on purchases =====

GST is an accrued current liability when a GST applicable sale, whether cash or credit ,is made. The creditor is the government taxation service. The liability account might be called GST collections. It is credited whenever cash in bank or accounts receivable is debited against a sale/revenue income account credit, and the total credits equals debits.

The moment a purchase is made, and an asset or expense is debited, a GST outlays  current asset account  is also debited; the total of the debits are made ''against''  the equivalent credit in cash in bank , or in accounts payable. 

Sale and purchase returns are simply reversals. If cash was handed over which included GST, it is handed back and the relevant GST account reversed ( GST collections debited for sales returns, GST outlays credited for purchase returns ).

Discounts are like partial reversals : if 2% of the sales is the discount offered for meeting early payment terms, then the cash received as a debit to cash in bank is offset the discounted amount and one tenth of the discounted amount, the discount amount debited to the discount allowed finance expense account, and the one tenth discount amount debited against the GST collections liability account, reversing one tenth of 2% of the GST that was owed by the original sale. ( The rest of the credit is against accounts receivable as usual for accrual sale, or against revenue income account if direct cash sale).

In the allowance method for bad debts for accounts receivable, GST collections is reversed for the bad debt when the bad debt is realised i.e. when the accounts receivable is credited for the bad debt and the GST on the bad debt, and the bad debts allowance contra-asset account is debited ( some jurisdictions might call bad debts a probable liability account and hence a provision ).

Non-current asset acquisitions may be for a group of assets, and GST outlay is usually calculated on the net fair value of the assets given up, but may include deductions on asset value  by acquired liabilities , as well. i.e. GST outlays debited 10%  of ( fair value of acquired assets - fair value of acquired liabilities).

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Section B Introduction=
This section will ask you questions that you will have to find programming solutions to.  There will be more than one way of answering each question, so the answers below are only indicative of what we are looking for.  As long as you get the same answers it doesn't matter how you do it. You may be given pseudeocode to help you program the problem.

==Batting Averages==
Write a program to enter batting scores until the number 0 is input.  And then output the total and average score.
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | 
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Dim count As Integer
Dim total As Integer
Dim score As Integer
Dim average As Integer

Do
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Enter Score: &quot;)
    score = Console.ReadLine
    total += score
    count += 1

Loop Until score = 0

average = total / count
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Your total score is: &quot; &amp; total)
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Your average score is: &quot; &amp; average)
Console.ReadLine()
&lt;/source&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

==Password Cracking==
Write code to keep asking for login, only accepting: username= PSN Password = easy.  Otherwise it should say. “Not hacked yet”:
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &amp;nbsp;
|-
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Dim username As String
Dim password As String

Do
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Enter username: &quot;)
    username = Console.ReadLine
    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Enter password: &quot;)
    password = Console.ReadLine

    If username = &quot;PSN&quot; And password = &quot;easy&quot; Then
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hacked!&quot;)
    Else
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Not Hacked yet&quot;)
    End If
Loop Until username = &quot;PSN&quot; And password = &quot;easy&quot;
Console.ReadLine()
&lt;/source&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;
|}
==Christmas Trees==
Write code to print out a Christmas tree of a user defined size: even rows = *, odd = #.  For example for the number 4 it should output:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;#&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;###&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;****&lt;/nowiki&gt;
{| class=&quot;collapsible collapsed&quot; style=&quot;border: none;&quot;
| '''Answer:'''

| colspan=&quot;2&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;vb&quot;&gt;
Dim number As Integer
Console.WriteLine(&quot;Please enter a number: &quot;)
number = Console.ReadLine
For count = 1 To number
    If count Mod 2 = 0 Then
        For x = 1 To count
           Console.Write(&quot;*&quot;)
        Next
        Console.WriteLine()
    Else
        For x = 1 To count
            Console.Write(&quot;#&quot;)
        Next
        Console.WriteLine()
    End If
Next
Console.ReadLine()

I know it's likely the nomination will be opposed as being too harsh on new editors or new projects, but I don't think the scope of this book fits in that of Wikibooks because of contains original research. It will probably be accepted in Wikiversity because of its educational nature though, so a '''wikiversity transwiki''' will probably be the best solution.

:I do not wont to write a Wikiversity Transwiki, but a Wikibook. It is the question, how tolerant wikibooks is.--[[User:Nobody60|Nobody60]] ([[User talk:Nobody60|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Nobody60|contribs]]) 22:38, 31 March 2011 (UTC)

::More an issue of policy. Wikibooks has determined that it is not a place for the publication of original research. The matter is not whether WB will tolerate religious texts or not -- we do, so long as they are not OR -- but whether we will break long-standing project policy about original research. [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:51, 1 April 2011 (UTC)

{{comment}}Unrelated to the RfD, but would it not be possible to channel the planned content of this wikibook into the [[Comparative Religion]] or [[Philosophy of Religion]] wikibooks, including sources and making existing books stronger? --[[User:Thereen|Thereen]] ([[User talk:Thereen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thereen|contribs]]) 04:46, 1 April 2011 (UTC)

{{comment}} In theory it should be possible to make this work have a neutral point of view, and avoid original research. A study of the main monotheistic religions, the points of commonality, historic grounds for dispute, etc., would be a valuable work. OF course I don't know if this is the intended thrust of the book, but the contents list suggests it may be. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 08:42, 1 April 2011 (UTC)
:I will try to make it from a neutral point of view. If necessary, you can help me and restructure individual sentences. The original research I will write in the Wikiversity and then refer to it. I will dispense on the angels oracle, if it is desired. Most I wrote in the Wikiversity about God is not my research, but only the traditional yoga and buddhist view, expressed in my words. In spirituality it is hard to explore something new. Someone always has written it in former times.--[[User:Nobody60|Nobody60]] ([[User talk:Nobody60|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Nobody60|contribs]]) 11:08, 1 April 2011 (UTC)
::I believe the purpose of the book is to find a way to allow people of different religions to tolerate each other. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think this is suitable for Wikibooks. Also, it might be better to write a book about toleration between religions (without saying that it's necessary), then do the actual how and why we should tolerate bit in Wikiversity, and refer to the Wikibook.

:Okay, I can write a book about toleration between religions, without saying that it is necessary. The purpose of the book is not to find a way to allow people of different religions to tolerate each other. The way exists already. I only want to inform in a neutral way. How and why I wrote already in Wikiversity. If this wikibook is ready, I can refer to it. --[[User:Nobody60|Nobody60]] ([[User talk:Nobody60|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Nobody60|contribs]]) 14:28, 1 April 2011 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Signal Modulation &amp; Demodulation==
Signal Modulation is a process of mixing Signal wave of low frequency with a Carrier wave of high frequency to produced a Broadcast wave for transmission over a long distance from a Transmitter to a Receiver

==Signal Modulation==
Signal Modulation takes place at the Transmitter
# [[/AM Modulation/]] 
# [[/FM Modulation/]] 
# [[/PM Modulation/]] 
==Signal DeModulation==
Signal Modulation takes place at the Receiver A process involves Tuning, Rectifying and Converting Modulation wave into Signal wave

      <text xml:space="preserve">==First Order Differential Equation ==

A differential equation is an equation that has the general form
: &lt;math&gt;A \frac{d f(x)}{dx} + B = 0  &lt;/math&gt;

Which can be rewritten as
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{dx} + \frac{B}{A} = 0  &lt;/math&gt;

Equivalent to
: &lt;math&gt;f^'(x) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

==Solving Differential 1st Ordered Equations==
: &lt;math&gt;A \frac{d f(x)}{dx} + B = 0  &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d f(x)}{dx} + \frac{B}{A} = 0  &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;f(x) = - \frac{B}{A}  &lt;/math&gt;

==SI units==
The base unit of volume in the SI system is the liter.
There are 1000 liters per cubic meter, or 1 liter contains the same volume as a cube with sides of length 10cm. A cube with sides of length of 1 cm or 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; contains a volume of 1 milliliter. A liter contains the same volume as 1000 ml or 1000 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are 2 sources of Electricity used in provide power to Electronic circuits to operate . DC which stands for Direct Current and AC which stands for Alternating Current

==DC==
Direct Current provides constant voltage over time and the flow of electric charge is only in one direction. Mathematically DC can be represented by a function
: &lt;math&gt;v(t) = v&lt;/math&gt;

Direct current is generated from many sources
# [[/Battery/]]
# [[/Dynmo/]]



==AC==
Alternate Current provide voltage varies sinusoidally over time with one complete cycle equals to &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;
: [[Image:Sine wave 2.svg|right|thumb|320px|A sine wave, over one cycle (360°). The dashed line represents the [[root mean square]] (RMS) value at about 0.707]]

An AC voltage ''v'' can be described mathematically as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of time by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt;v(t)=V_\mathrm{peak}\cdot\sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;,

where
*&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle V_{\rm peak}&lt;/math&gt; is the peak voltage (unit: [[volt]]),
*&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] (unit: [[radians per second]])
**The angular frequency is related to the physical frequency, &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle f&lt;/math&gt; (unit = [[hertz]]), which represents the number of cycles per second , by the equation &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle\omega = 2\pi f&lt;/math&gt;.
*&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle t&lt;/math&gt; is the time (unit: [[second]]).

The peak-to-peak value of an AC voltage is defined as the difference between its positive peak and its negative peak.  Since the maximum value of &lt;math&gt;\sin(x)&lt;/math&gt; is +1 and the minimum value is −1, an AC voltage swings between &lt;math&gt;+V_{\rm peak}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;-V_{\rm peak}&lt;/math&gt;.  The peak-to-peak voltage, usually written as &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm pp}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm P-P}&lt;/math&gt;, is therefore &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm peak} - (-V_{\rm peak}) = 2 V_{\rm peak}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Power and root mean square===

The relationship between voltage and the power delivered is

:&lt;math&gt;p(t) = \frac{v^2(t)}{R}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; represents a load resistance.

Rather than using instantaneous power, &lt;math&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt;, it is more practical to use a time averaged power (where the averaging is performed over any integer number of cycles). Therefore, AC voltage is often expressed as a [[root mean square]] (RMS) value, written as &lt;math&gt;V_{\rm rms}&lt;/math&gt;, because
:&lt;math&gt;P_{\rm time~averaged} = \frac{{V^2}_{\rm rms}}{R}.&lt;/math&gt;

For a sinusoidal voltage:
:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{rms}=\frac{V_\mathrm{peak}}{\sqrt{2}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The factor &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is called the [[crest factor]], which varies for different waveforms.
*For a [[triangle wave]] form centered about zero
:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm{rms}=\frac{V_\mathrm{peak}}{\sqrt{3}}.&lt;/math&gt;
*For a [[square wave]] form centered about zero
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle V_\mathrm{rms}=V_\mathrm{peak}.&lt;/math&gt;

=== Example ===

To illustrate these concepts, consider a 230 V AC [[Mains power systems|mains]] supply used in [[Mains power systems#Table of mains voltages and frequencies|many countries]] around the world. It is so called because its [[root mean square]] value is 230 V. This means that the time-averaged power delivered is equivalent to the power delivered by a DC voltage of 230 V. To determine the peak voltage (amplitude), we can rearrange the above equation to:
:&lt;math&gt;
V_\mathrm{peak}=\sqrt{2}\ V_\mathrm{rms}.
&lt;/math&gt;

For our 230 V AC, the peak voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt; is therefore &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle 230 V \times\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;, which is about 325 V. The peak-to-peak value &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle V_{P-P}&lt;/math&gt; of the 230 V AC is double that, at about 650 V.

Note that [[Mains power systems|some countries]] use a frequency of 50&amp;nbsp;Hz, while others use a frequency of 60&amp;nbsp;Hz. The calculation to convert from RMS voltage to peak voltage is independent of the frequency.



In certain applications, different waveforms are used, such as [[Triangle wave|triangular]] or [[square wave]]s. [[Audio frequency|Audio]] and [[Radio frequency|radio]] signals carried on electrical wires are also examples of alternating current. In these applications, an important goal is often the recovery of information encoded (or [[modulated]]) onto the AC signal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Electric Generator==
In electricity generation, an electric generator is a device that converts mechanical energy to electrical energy

==Principle of operation==
[[File:Alternator 1.svg|Alt=Alternator diagram|200px]]

Alternators generate electricity using the same principle as DC generators, namely, when the magnetic field around a conductor changes, a current is induced in the conductor. Typically, a rotating magnet, called the [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] turns within a stationary set of conductors wound in coils on an iron core, called the [[stator]]. The field cuts across the conductors, generating an induced EMF(Electro-Magnetic Field), as the mechanical input causes the rotor to turn.

The [[rotating magnetic field]] induces an [[alternating current|AC voltage]] in the stator windings. Often there are three sets of stator windings, physically offset so that the rotating magnetic field produces a [[three phase]] current, displaced by one-third of a period with respect to each other.

The rotors magnetic field may be produced by induction (as in a &quot;brush-less&quot; alternator), by permanent magnets (as in very small machines), or by a rotor winding energized with direct current through [[slip rings]] and brushes. The rotors magnetic field may even be provided by stationary field winding, with moving poles in the rotor. Automotive alternators invariably use a rotor winding, which allows control of the alternators generated voltage by varying the current in the rotor field winding. Permanent magnet machines avoid the loss due to magnetizing current in the rotor, but are restricted in size, owing to the cost of the magnet material. Since the permanent magnet field is constant, the terminal voltage varies directly with the speed of the generator. Brushless AC generators are usually larger machines than those used in automotive applications.

An automatic voltage control device controls the field current to keep output voltage constant. If the output voltage from the stationary armature coils drops due to an increase in demand, more current is fed into the rotating field coils through the [[Automatic Voltage Regulator]] or AVR. This increases the magnetic field around the field coils which induces a greater voltage in the armature coils. Thus, the output voltage is brought back up to its original value.

Alternators in central [[power stations]] use may also control the field current to regulate [[reactive power]] and to help stabilize the power system against the effects of momentary [[fault (electrical)|faults]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Thyristor==
A thyristor is a solid-state semiconductor device with four layers of alternating N and P-type material. They act as bistable switches, conducting when their gate receives a current pulse, and continue to conduct while they are forward biased (that is, while the voltage across the device is not reversed).

* Symbol
:[[File:Thyristor_layers.svg|100px]]

==Construction==
The thyristor is a four-layer, three terminal semiconducting device, with each layer consisting of alternately [[N-type semiconductor|N-type]] or [[P-type semiconductor|P-type]] material, for example P-N-P-N. The main terminals, labelled anode and cathode, are across the full four layers, and the control terminal, called the gate, is attached to p-type material near to the cathode. (A variant called an SCS—Silicon Controlled Switch—brings all four layers out to terminals.) The operation of a thyristor can be understood in terms of a pair of tightly coupled [[bipolar junction transistor]]s, arranged to cause the self-latching action:
:[[File:thyristor.svg]]

Thyristors have three states:
# Reverse blocking mode — Voltage is applied in the direction that would be blocked by a diode
# Forward blocking mode — Voltage is applied in the direction that would cause a diode to conduct, but the thyristor has not yet been triggered into conduction
# Forward conducting mode — The thyristor has been triggered into conduction and will remain conducting until the forward current drops below a threshold value known as the &quot;holding current&quot;

== Operations==
===Gate trigger voltage ===
The thyristor has three [[p-n junction]]s (serially named J&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, J&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from the anode).
:[[File:Thyristor layers.svg|100px]]
When the anode is at a positive potential V&lt;sub&gt;AK&lt;/sub&gt; with respect to the cathode with no voltage applied at the gate, junctions J&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and J&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are forward biased, while junction J&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reverse biased. As J&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reverse biased, no conduction takes place (Off state). Now if ''V''&lt;sub&gt;AK&lt;/sub&gt; is increased beyond the breakdown voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;BO&lt;/sub&gt; of the thyristor, [[avalanche breakdown]] of J&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; takes place and the thyristor starts conducting (On state).

If a positive potential ''V''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; is applied at the gate terminal with respect to the cathode, the breakdown of the junction J&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; occurs at a lower value of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;AK&lt;/sub&gt;. By selecting an appropriate value of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;, the thyristor can be switched into the on state suddenly.

Once avalanche breakdown has occurred, the thyristor continues to conduct, irrespective of the gate voltage, until: (a) the potential ''V''&lt;sub&gt;AK&lt;/sub&gt; is removed or (b) the current through the device (anode−cathode) is less than the holding current specified by the manufacturer. Hence ''V''&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt; can be a voltage pulse, such as the voltage output from a [[UJT]] [[relaxation oscillator]].

These gate pulses are characterized in terms of gate trigger voltage (''V''&lt;sub&gt;GT&lt;/sub&gt;) and gate trigger current (''I''&lt;sub&gt;GT&lt;/sub&gt;). Gate trigger current varies inversely with gate pulse width in such a way that it is evident that there is a minimum gate [[electric charge|charge]] required to trigger the thyristor.

=== Switching characteristics ===
:[[File:Thyristor I-V diagram.svg|400px]]
In a conventional thyristor, once it has been switched on by the gate terminal, the device remains latched in the on-state (''i.e.'' does not need a continuous supply of gate current to conduct), providing the anode current has exceeded the latching current (''I''&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;). As long as the anode remains positively biased, it cannot be switched off until the anode current falls below the holding current (''I''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;).

A thyristor can be switched off if the external circuit causes the anode to become negatively biased. In some applications this is done by switching a second thyristor to discharge a capacitor into the cathode of the first thyristor. This method is called forced commutation.

After a thyristor has been switched off by forced commutation, a finite time delay must have elapsed before the anode can again be positively biased ''and'' retain the thyristor in the off-state. This minimum delay is called the circuit commutated turn off time (''t''&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt;). Attempting to positively bias the anode within this time causes the thyristor to be self-triggered by the remaining charge carriers ([[Electron hole|holes]] and [[electron]]s) that have not yet [[Carrier generation and recombination|recombined]].

For applications with frequencies higher than the domestic AC mains supply (e.g. 50&amp;nbsp;Hz or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz), thyristors with lower values of ''t''&lt;sub&gt;Q&lt;/sub&gt; are required. Such fast thyristors are made by diffusing into the silicon [[heavy metals]] [[ion]]s such as [[gold]] or [[platinum]] which act as charge combination centres. Alternatively, fast thyristors may be made by [[neutron]] [[irradiation]] of the silicon.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Silicon Controlled Rectifier==
A '''silicon-controlled rectifier''' (or '''semiconductor-controlled rectifier''') is a four-layer [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] device that controls [[Electric current|current]].  The name &quot;silicon controlled rectifier&quot; or '''SCR''' is [[General Electric]]'s trade name for a type of [[thyristor]].  The SCR was developed by a team of [[power engineer]]s led by Gordon Hall and commercialized by Frank W. &quot;Bill&quot; Gutzwiller in [[1957]].
:[[Image:SCR.JPG|200px]]

==Symbol==
: [[Image:Thyristor circuit symbol.svg|200px]]

==Construction of SCR==
An SCR consists of four layers of alternating [[P-type semiconductor|P]] and [[N-type semiconductor|N]] type [[semiconductor]] materials. Silicon is used as the intrinsic semiconductor, to which the proper [[dopant]]s are added. The junctions are either diffused or alloyed. The planar construction is used for low power SCRs (and all the junctions are diffused). The [[Mesa (disambiguation)|mesa type construction]] is used for high power SCRs. In this case, junction J2 is obtained by the diffusion method and then the outer two layers are [[alloyed]] to it, since the PNPN pellet is required to handle large [[Electric current|currents]]. It is properly braced with [[tungsten]] or [[molybdenum]] plates to provide greater mechanical strength. One of these plates is hard soldered to a [[copper]] stud, which is threaded for attachment of [[heat sink]]. The doping of PNPN will depend on the application of SCR,
since its characteristics are similar to those of the [[thyratron]]. Today, the term thyristor applies to the larger family of multilayer devices that exhibit bistable state-change behaviour, that is, switching either ON or OFF.

==Application of SCRs==
SCRs are mainly used in devices where the control of high power, possibly coupled with high voltage, is demanded. Their operation makes them suitable for use in medium to high-voltage AC power control applications, such as lamp dimming, regulators and motor control.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Gate turn-off thyristor (GTO)==
A '''gate turn-off thyristor (GTO)''' is a special type of [[thyristor]], a high-power [[semiconductor device]]. GTOs, as opposed to normal thyristors, are fully controllable switches which can be turned on and off by their third lead, the GATE lead.

== Draft paragraph on optimality conditions ==

''Note'': the following paragraph is provisional and will be transferred to the main document when a consensus is reached.

''Source'': original contribution by Robbie Morrison

Some readers may not be familiar with the KKT formulation used by GLPK.
Textbooks on linear programming often present the optimality conditions in terms of ''strong duality'' and ''complementary slackness''.
Strong duality is fulfilled when the primal &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and dual feasible &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; solutions both exist and yield the same objective value.
Complementary slackness is fulfilled when, for any variable &lt;math&gt;x_i&lt;/math&gt; strictly between its lower and upper bounds, the slack in the corresponding dual constraint (equivalently, the variable's reduced cost) is zero.
Complementary slackness is a special case of the KKT conditions for differentiable optimization.
Moreover, in the case of linear programming, the KKT conditions alone are necessary and sufficient for a given optimum to be global.  Hence the optima GLPK finds are always global.

''Source'': 11 May 2011 [http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/help-glpk/2011-05/msg00044.html posting] by Andrew Makhorin, duly sub-edited

{{Yellow Warning|[[GLPK/Background_theory#Karush-Kahn-Tucker_.28KKT.29_optimality_conditions|transferred]] &amp;mdash; will be deleted here in due course &amp;mdash; [[User:Robbiemorrison|Robbiemorrison]] ([[User talk:Robbiemorrison|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Robbiemorrison|contribs]]) 10:06, 14 May 2011 (UTC)}}

In the general case of [[w:Nonlinear_programming|nonlinear programming]] (NLP), the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker optimality conditions (KKT) provide the necessary first-order conditions for a solution to be locally optimal (together with some regularity conditions that also have to be satisfied).  [[w:Linear_programming|Linear programming]] (LP) is a special case of NLP in which both the feasible region and the objective function are [[w:Convex_function|convex]].  In this particular case, the KKT conditions alone are necessary and sufficient for the solution to be globally optimal.  The KKT conditions can be applied to the basic and interior-point solutions from any LP problem, but may not be applied to the solutions from mixed-integer linear programming (MIP).

''Notes'': (Robbie)
* the original material (the gray blocks) would be deleted on transfer, it is provided here to aid checking
* I suggest we make a new page entitled &quot;Theory&quot;, move this material there, and then link back to it

&lt;!-- NOTE: the various \,\! are to keep the math formula rendered as PNG instead of HTML, please don't remove them --&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Original (primal) LP problem in the standard format:

   minimize  z = c'x
   s.t.     Ax = b
             x &gt;= 0

where x is a vector of primal variables.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Take a primal LP problem in [[w:Linear_programming#Augmented_form_.28slack_form.29|standard form]]:&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;
The LP terminology for equation types is unfortunately inconsistent.  This expression is also referred to as the ''canonical form'' and the term ''standard form'' then applies to something else.&lt;/ref&gt;

{|
| minimize                                  || &lt;math&gt;z = \mathbf{c}^\top \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot;
|  style=&quot;padding-right: 20px&quot; | subject to || &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                                                         A \mathbf{x} &amp; = \mathbf{b} \\
                                                         \mathbf{x}   &amp; \geq \mathbf{0}
                                                     \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; is the vector of primal variables.

&lt;pre&gt;
Dual LP problem

   maximize  p = b'pi + 0'lambda

   s.t.     A'pi + lambda = c

            lambda &gt;= 0, pi of any sign

where (pi, lambda) is a vector of dual variables, pi is a vector of
Lagrange multipliers (simplex multipliers, shadow prices) for equality
constraints Ax = b, lambda is a vector of Langrange multipliers (reduced
costs) for inequality constraints x &gt;= 0.
&lt;/pre&gt;

The dual LP problem becomes:

{|
| maximize                                  || &lt;math&gt;p = \mathbf{b}^\top \pi + \mathbf{0}^\top \lambda&lt;/math&gt;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot;
|  style=&quot;padding-right: 20px&quot; | subject to || &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                                                      A^\top \mathbf{\pi} + \lambda &amp; = \mathbf{c} \\
                                                      \mathbf{\lambda}              &amp; \geq \mathbf{0} \\
                                                      \pi                           &amp; \quad \text{of any sign}
                                                  \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

where &lt;math&gt;(\pi \,|\, \lambda)\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of dual variables, &lt;math&gt;\pi\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of Lagrange (or simplex) multipliers (shadow prices) for the equality constraint &lt;math&gt;A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a vector of Lagrange multipliers (reduced costs) for the inequality constraint  &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} \geq \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;pre&gt;
KKT optimality conditions for LP consists of *all* constraints from both
the primal and dual problems plus the complementary slackness
condition, i.e. in total we have the following five conditions:

   KKT.PE   Ax = b

   KKT.PB   x &gt;= 0

   KKT.DE   A'pi + lambda = c

   KKT.DB   lambda &gt;= 0

   KKT.CS   x[j] = 0 and/or lambda[j] = 0 for all j
&lt;/pre&gt;

The KKT optimality conditions for an LP make use of ''all'' the constraints from the primal and dual formulations and include a complimentary slackness condition.  The five KKT conditions are.

{|
|  style=&quot;padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px&quot; | &lt;tt&gt;KTT.PE&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;math&gt;A \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|  style=&quot;padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px&quot; | &lt;tt&gt;KTT.PB&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} \geq \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|  style=&quot;padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px&quot; | &lt;tt&gt;KTT.DE&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;math&gt;A^\top \mathbf{\pi} + \lambda = \mathbf{c}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|  style=&quot;padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px&quot; | &lt;tt&gt;KTT.DB&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\lambda \geq \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|  style=&quot;padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px&quot; | &lt;tt&gt;KTT.CS&lt;/tt&gt; || &lt;math&gt;x_j = 0 \ \text{or} \ \lambda_j = 0 \ \text{for all} \ j \ \text{(or both)}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

&lt;pre&gt;
The KKT.CS condition can be rewritten in equivalent form
x[j] * lambda[j] = 0 or simply lambda'x = 0, i.e. vectors x and lambda
have to be orthogonal.
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;KKT.CS&lt;/tt&gt; condition can be rewritten as &lt;math&gt;x_j \lambda_j = 0\,\!&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\lambda^\top \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt; meaning vectors &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\lambda\,\!&lt;/math&gt; must be orthogonal.

&lt;pre&gt;
In GLPK the KKT conditions used are a bit more complicated in its format
(but equivalent to the ones shown above having the same meaning),
because in GLPK variables may have both lower and upper bounds as well
as no bounds:

   min/max z = c'x

   s.t.    (I | -A)x = 0

           l &lt;= x &lt;= u

where x is a vector of all auxiliary and structural variables
&lt;/pre&gt;

The ''implementation'' of the KKT conditions within GLPK are a little more complicated because GLPK supports variables with lower &lt;math&gt;l_j\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and upper &lt;math&gt;u_j\,\!&lt;/math&gt; bounds, which also implies no bounds.  In general:

|  style=&quot;padding-right: 20px&quot; | minimize or maximize || &lt;math&gt;z = \mathbf{c}^\top \mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt;
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top&quot;
|                                subject to           || &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
                                                                   &amp; (I \; | \; -\!A) \mathbf{x} = \mathbf{0} \\
                                                                   &amp; \mathbf{l} \leq \mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{u}
                                                               \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}&lt;/math&gt; (as earlier) is the vector of structural and axillary variables and &lt;math&gt;I\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is an identity matrix.
Nonetheless the conditions used in GLPK are equivalent to those shown above and have the same meaning.

&lt;/pre&gt;

Finally, be aware that the KKT conditions &lt;tt&gt;KKT.PE&lt;tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;KTT.PB&lt;tt&gt; can be calculated for an MIP solution and GLPK will do this on request.  In this case, these two conditions are described as &quot;integer feasibility conditions&quot; instead.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===&lt;center&gt;Area of a Surface of Revolution&lt;/center&gt;===

This section starts by construction surfaces.  A curve &lt;math&gt;y = f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is revolved around an axis.  That produces a &quot;surface of revolution,&quot; which is symmeric around the axis we get a cylinder (a pipe).  By revolving a curve we might get a lamp or a lamp shade (or even the light bulb).

&lt;p&gt;The key idea is to resolve short straight line segments.  Their slope is &lt;math&gt;\frac {\operatorname {d}y}{\operatorname {d}x}&lt;/math&gt;.  They can be the same pieces of lenth &lt;math&gt;\operatorname {d}s&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\Delta s&lt;/math&gt; that were used to find length.  Now we compute area.  When revolved, a straight piece produces a thing band.  The curved surface, from revolving &lt;math&gt;y = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;, is close to the bands.  The first step is to compute the surface area of a band.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A small comment: Curved surfaces can also be cut into tiny patches.  Each patch is nearly flat, like a little square.  The sum of those patches leads to a double integral (with &lt;math&gt;\operatorname {d}x  \operatorname {d}y&lt;/math&gt;).  Here the integral stays one-dimentional (&lt;math&gt;\operatorname {d}x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname {d}y&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname {d}t&lt;/math&gt;).  Surface of revolution are special - we approximate them by bands that go all the way around.  A band is just a belt with aa slope, and its slope has an effect on its area.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Revolve a small straight piece (length &lt;math&gt;\Delta s&lt;/math&gt; not &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;).  The center of the piece goes around a circle of radius r.  The band is a slice of cone.  When we flatten it out we discover its area.  The area is the side length &lt;math&gt;\Delta s&lt;/math&gt; times the middle circumference &lt;math&gt;2 \pi r&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;The surface area of a band is &lt;math&gt;2 \pi r \Delta s = 2 \pi r \sqrt{1 + \left (\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}\right)^2} \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;For revolution around the y axis, the radius is r = x.  For revolution around the x axis, the radius is the height: &lt;math&gt;r = y = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;.  The sum of band areas &lt;math&gt;2 \pi r \Delta s&lt;/math&gt; is close to the area S of the curved surface.  In the limit we integrate &lt;math&gt;2 \pi r \operatorname {d}s&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;The surface area generated by revolving the curve &lt;math&gt;y = f(x)&lt;/math&gt; between &lt;math&gt;x = a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x = b&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;br&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;math&gt;S = \int_{a}^{b} 2 \pi y \sqrt{1 + \left (\frac {\operatorname {d}y}{\operatorname {d}x}\right)^2} \operatorname {d}x&lt;/math&gt; around the x axis (r = y) (1)&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;S = \int_{a}^{b} 2 \pi x \sqrt{1 + \left (\frac {\operatorname {d}y}{\operatorname {d}x}\right)^2} \operatorname {d}x&lt;/math&gt; around the y axis (r = x).  (2)&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Example 1'''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revolve a complete semicircle &lt;math&gt;y = \sqrt{R^2 - x^2}&lt;/math&gt; around the x-axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The surface of revolution is a sphere.  Its area is &lt;math&gt;4 \pi R^2&lt;/math&gt;.  The limits on x are -R and R.  The slope of &lt;math&gt;y = \sqrt{R^2 - x^2}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\frac {\operatorname {d}y}{\operatorname {d}x} = \frac {-x}{\sqrt{R^2 - x^2}}&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;area &lt;math&gt;S = \int_{-R}^{R} 2 \pi \sqrt{R^2 - x^2} \sqrt{1 + \frac {x^2}{R^2 - x^2}} \operatorname {d}x = \int_{-R}^{R} 2 \pi R \operatorname {d}x = 4 \pi R^2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Example 2'''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revolve a piece of the straight line &lt;math&gt;y = 2x&lt;/math&gt; around the x axis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The surface is a cone with &lt;math&gt;\left (\frac {\operatorname {d}y}{\operatorname {d}x}\right)^2 = 4&lt;/math&gt;.  The band from x = 0 to x = 1 has area &lt;math&gt;2 \pi \sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;S = \int 2 \pi y \operatorname {d}s = \int_{0}^{1} 2 \pi (2x) \sqrt{1 + 4} \operatorname {d}x = 2 \pi \sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;The answer must agree with the formula &lt;math&gt;2 \pi r \Delta s&lt;/math&gt; (which it came from).  The line from (0,0) to (1, 2) has length &lt;math&gt;\Delta s = \sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;.  Its midpoint is &lt;math&gt;\left (\frac {1}{2}, 1 \right)&lt;/math&gt;.  Around the x axis, the middle radius is r = 1 and the area is &lt;math&gt;2 \pi \sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Example 3'''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Revolve the same straight line segment around the y axis.  Now the radius is x instead of y = 2x.  The area in Example 2 is cut in half:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;S = \int 2 \pi x \operatorname {d}s = \int_{0}^{1} 2 \pi x \sqrt{1 + 4} \operatorname {d}x = \sqrt {5}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;For surfaces with arc length, only a few examples have convenient answers.  Watermelons, basketballs and light bulbs are in the exercises.  Rather than stretching this section out, the final area formula will be shown.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The formula applies when there is a parameter t.  Instead of &lt;math&gt;(x, f(x))&lt;/math&gt; the points on the curve are &lt;math&gt;\left (x(t), y(t) \right)&lt;/math&gt;.  As t varies, we move along the curve.  The length formula &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname {d}s)^2 = (\operatorname {d}x)^2 + (\operatorname {d}y)^2&lt;/math&gt; is expressed in terms of t.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;For the surface of revolution around the x axis, the area becomes a t-integral.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;The surface area is &lt;math&gt;\int 2 \pi y \operatorname {d}s = \int 2 \pi y(t) \sqrt{\left (\frac {\operatorname {d}x}{\operatorname {d}t}\right)^2 + \left (\frac {\operatorname {d}y}{\operatorname {d}t}\right)^2}\operatorname {d}t&lt;/math&gt;.  (3)&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Example 4'''&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The point &lt;math&gt;x = \cos t, y = 5 + \sin t&lt;/math&gt; travels on a circle with center at (0, 5).  Revolving that circle around the x axis produces a doughnut.  Find tis surface area.
&lt;br&gt;SOLUTION&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\left (\frac {\operatorname {d}x}{\operatorname {d}t}\right)^2 + \left(\frac {\operatorname {d}y}{\operatorname {d}t}\right)^2 = \sin^2 t + \cos^2 t = 1&lt;/math&gt;.  The circle complete at &lt;math&gt;t = 2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;:&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int 2 \pi y \operatorname {d}s = \int_{0}^{2 \pi} 2 \pi(5+\sin t) \operatorname {d}t= \left [2 \pi (5t - \cos t)\right]_{0}^{2 \pi} = 20 \pi^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

===&lt;center&gt;Exercises&lt;/center&gt;===
'''Read through questions'''
&lt;p&gt;A surface of revolution comes from revolving a &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; around &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt;.  This section computes the &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;.  When the curve is a short straigh piece (length &lt;math&gt; \Delta s&lt;/math&gt;), the surface is a &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;.  Its area is &lt;math&gt;\Delta S = \bullet&lt;/math&gt;.  In that formula &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is the radius of &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;.  The line from (0, 0) to (1, 1) has length &lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt; and revolving it produces area &lt;i&gt;h&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the curve &lt;math&gt;y = f(x)&lt;/math&gt; revolves around the a axis, the surface area is the integral &lt;i&gt;i&lt;/i&gt;.  For &lt;math&gt;y = x^2&lt;/math&gt; the integral to compute &lt;i&gt;j&lt;/i&gt;.  When &lt;math&gt;y = x^2&lt;/math&gt; is revolved around the y axis the area is S = &lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;.  For the curve given by &lt;math&gt;x = 2t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y = t^2&lt;/math&gt;, change &lt;math&gt;\operatorname {d}s&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;i&gt;l&lt;/i&gt; &lt;math&gt;\operatorname {d}t&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;'''Find the surface area when curves 1 - 6 revolve around the x axis.'''&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) &lt;math&gt;y = sqrt{x}&lt;math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;2 \le x \le 6&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) &lt;math&gt;y = x^3&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 \le x \le 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3) &lt;math&gt;y = 7x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; -1 \le x \le 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4) &lt;math&gt;y = \sqrt{4 - x^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 \le x \le 2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;5) &lt;math&gt;y = \sqrt{4 - x^2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;-1 \le x \le 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;6) &lt;math&gt;y = \cosh x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 \le x \le 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;'''In 7-10 find the area of the surface of revolution around the y axis.'''&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7) &lt;math&gt;y = x^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 \le x \le 2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;8) &lt;math&gt;y = \frac {1}{2} x^2 + \frac {1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;0 \le x \le 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;9) &lt;math&gt;y = x + 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; 0 \le x \le 3&lt;math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;10) &lt;math&gt;y = x^{\frac {1}{3}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \le x \le 1&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;11) Slices of a basketball all have the same area of cover, if they have the same thickness. &lt;br&gt;(a) Rotate &lt;math&gt;y = \sqrt {1 - x^2}&lt;/math&gt; around the x axis.  Show that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname {d}S = 2 \pi \operatorname {d}x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/br&gt; &lt;br&gt;(b) The area between x = a and x = a + h is __________.&lt;/br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Derivative==
In [[calculus]], '''Leibniz's notation''', named in honor of the 17th-century [[Germany|German]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[mathematics|mathematician]] [[Gottfried Leibniz|Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], uses the symbols d''x'' and d''y'' to represent &quot;infinitely small&quot; (or [[infinitesimal]]) increments of ''x'' and ''y'', just as Δ''x'' and Δ''y'' represent finite increments of ''x'' and ''y''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Stewart | first=James | authorlink=James Stewart (mathematician) | title=Calculus: Early Transcendentals |publisher=[[Brooks/Cole]] | edition=6th | year=2008 | isbn=0-495-01166-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For ''y'' as a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of ''x'', or

:&lt;math&gt;y=f(x) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

the [[derivative (mathematics)|derivative]] of ''y'' with respect to ''x'', which later came to be viewed as

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(x + \Delta x)-f(x)}{(x + \Delta x)-x},&lt;/math&gt;

was, according to Leibniz, the [[quotient]] of an infinitesimal increment of ''y'' by an infinitesimal increment of ''x'', or

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}=f'(x),&lt;/math&gt;

where the right hand side is [[Notation for differentiation|Lagrange's notation]] for the derivative of ''f'' at ''x''.  From the point of view of modern infinitesimal theory, &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is an infinitesimal ''x''-increment, &lt;math&gt;\Delta y&lt;/math&gt; is the corresponding ''y''-increment, and the derivative is the [[standard part]] of the infinitesimal ratio: 
:&lt;math&gt;f'(x)={\rm st}\Bigg( \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} \Bigg)&lt;/math&gt;.
Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;f'(x)&lt;/math&gt; is the real number [[adequal]] to the infinitesimal ratio &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta y}&lt;/math&gt;.  Then one sets &lt;math&gt;dx=\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;dy = f'(x) dx\,&lt;/math&gt;, so that by definition, &lt;math&gt;f'(x)\,&lt;/math&gt; is the ratio of ''dy'' by ''dx''.

Similarly, although mathematicians sometimes now view an integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int f(x)\,dx&lt;/math&gt;

as a limit

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\Delta x\rightarrow 0}\sum_{i} f(x_i)\,\Delta x,&lt;/math&gt;

where Δ''x'' is an interval containing ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, Leibniz viewed it as the sum (the integral sign denoting summation) of infinitely many infinitesimal quantities ''f''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;d''x''.  From the modern viewpoint, it is more correct to view the integral as the [[standard part]] of, or [[adequal]] to, an infinite sum of such quantities.

==History==

The Newton-Leibniz approach to [[infinitesimal calculus]] was introduced in the 17th century. While Newton did not have a standard notation for integration, Leibniz began using the &lt;math&gt;\int&lt;/math&gt; character. He based the character on the Latin word ''summa'' (&quot;sum&quot;), which he wrote ''ſumma'' with the [[long s|elongated s]] commonly used in Germany at the time. This use first appeared publicly in his paper ''De Geometria'', published in ''[[Acta Eruditorum]]'' of June 1686,&lt;ref&gt;''Mathematics and its History'', John Stillwell, Springer 1989, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; but he had been using it in private manuscripts at least since 1675.&lt;ref&gt;''Early Mathematical Manuscripts of Leibniz'', J. M. Child, Open Court Publishing Co., 1920, pp. 73–74, 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, mathematicians ceased to take Leibniz's notation for derivatives and integrals literally.  That is, mathematicians felt that the concept of [[infinitesimal]]s contained logical contradictions in its development. A number of 19th century mathematicians ([[Cauchy]], [[Weierstrass]] and others) found logically rigorous ways to treat derivatives and integrals without infinitesimals using limits as shown above. Nonetheless, Leibniz's notation is still in general use. Although the notation need not be taken literally, it is usually simpler than alternatives when the technique of [[separation of variables]] is used in the solution of differential equations.  In physical applications, one may for example regard ''f''(''x'') as measured in meters per second, and d''x'' in seconds, so that ''f''(''x'') d''x'' is in meters, and so is the value of its definite integral. In that way the Leibniz notation is in harmony with [[dimensional analysis]].

In the 1960s, building upon earlier work by [[Edwin Hewitt]] and [[Jerzy Łoś]], [[Abraham Robinson]] introduced ways of treating infinitesimals both literally and logically rigorously, as a foundation for both calculus and analysis.  Robinson's methods are used by only a minority of mathematicians.  [[Jerome Keisler]] wrote a [http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html first-year-calculus textbook] based to Robinson's approach.

==Leibniz's notation for differentiation==

In Leibniz's [[notation]] for [[derivative|differentiation]], the derivative of the function ''f''(''x'') is written:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\bigl(f(x)\bigr)}{dx}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

If we have a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] representing a function, for example if we set

:&lt;math&gt;y=f(x) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

then we can write the derivative as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[Notation for differentiation|Lagrange's notation]], we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d\bigl(f(x)\bigr)}{dx} = f'(x)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Using [[Newton's notation]], we can write:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = \dot{x}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For higher derivatives, we express them as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^n\bigl(f(x)\bigr)}{dx^n}\text{ or }\frac{d^ny}{dx^n}&lt;/math&gt;

denotes the ''n''th derivative of ƒ(''x'') or ''y'' respectively. Historically, this came from the fact that, for example, the third derivative is:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d \left(\frac{d \left( \frac{d \left(f(x)\right)} {dx}\right)} {dx}\right)} {dx}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

which we can loosely write as:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{d}{dx}\right)^3 \bigl(f(x)\bigr) =
\frac{d^3}{\left(dx\right)^3} \bigl(f(x)\bigr)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

Now drop the parentheses and we have:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^3}{dx^3}\bigl(f(x)\bigr)\ \mbox{or}\ \frac{d^3y}{dx^3}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[chain rule]] and [[integration by substitution]] rules are especially easy to express here, because the &quot;''d''&quot; terms appear to cancel:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du_1} \cdot \frac{du_1}{du_2} \cdot \frac{du_2}{du_3}\cdots \frac{du_n}{dx}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

etc., and:

:&lt;math&gt;\int y \, dx = \int y \frac{dx}{du} \, du.&lt;/math&gt;

The notation for derivatives introduced by [[Gottfried Leibniz]] is one of the earliest. It is still commonly used when the equation ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ƒ(''x'') is viewed as a functional relationship between [[dependent and independent variables]]. Then the first derivative is denoted by

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx},\quad\frac{d f}{dx}(x),\;\;\mathrm{or}\;\; \frac{d}{dx}f(x),&lt;/math&gt;

and was once thought of as an [[infinitesimal]] quotient.  Higher derivatives are expressed using the notation

&lt;!-- In the following formula, the function is a lower-case f, not an upper case F.  Please do not change it.--&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{d^ny}{dx^n},
\quad\frac{d^n f}{dx^n}(x),
\;\;\mathrm{or}\;\;
\frac{d^n}{dx^n}f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

for the ''n''th derivative of ''y''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;ƒ(''x'') (with respect to ''x''). These are abbreviations for multiple applications of the derivative operator. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2y}{dx^2} = \frac{d}{dx}\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

With Leibniz's notation, we can write the derivative of ''y'' at the point ''x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a'' in two different ways:

: &lt;math&gt;\left.\frac{dy}{dx}\right|_{x=a} = \frac{dy}{dx}(a).&lt;/math&gt;

Leibniz's notation allows one to specify the variable for differentiation (in the denominator). This is especially relevant for [[partial derivative|partial differentiation]].  It also makes the [[chain rule]] easy to remember:&lt;ref&gt;In the formulation of calculus in terms of limits, the ''du'' symbol has been assigned various meanings by various authors.  Some authors do not assign a meaning to ''du'' by itself, but only as part of the symbol ''du''/''dx''.  Others define &quot;dx&quot; as an independent variable, and define ''du'' by ''du''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''dx''•&amp;fnof;&amp;prime; (''x'').  In [[non-standard analysis]] ''du'' is defined as an infinitesimal. It is also interpreted as the [[exterior derivative]] d''u'' of a function ''u''. See [[differential (infinitesimal)]] for further information.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Lagrange's notation===
Sometimes referred to as '''prime notation''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/wwmath/calculus/differentiation/notation.html]&lt;/ref&gt; one of the most common modern notations for differentiation is due to [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]] and uses the [[Prime (symbol)|prime mark]], so that the derivative of a function ƒ(''x'') is denoted ƒ&amp;prime;(''x'') or simply ƒ&amp;prime;. Similarly, the second and third derivatives are denoted
:&lt;math&gt;(f')'=f''\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; and &amp;emsp; &lt;math&gt;(f'')'=f'''.\,&lt;/math&gt;
To denote the number of derivatives beyond this point, some authors use Roman numerals in [[Subscript and superscript|superscript]], whereas others place the number in parentheses:
:&lt;math&gt;f^{\mathrm{iv}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; or &amp;emsp; &lt;math&gt;f^{(4)}.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
The latter notation generalizes to yield the notation ƒ&lt;sup&gt; (''n'')&lt;/sup&gt; for the ''n''th derivative of ƒ — this notation is most useful when we wish to talk about the derivative as being a function itself, as in this case the Leibniz notation can become cumbersome.

===Newton's notation===

{{Main|Newton's notation}}

[[Newton's notation]] for differentiation, also called the dot notation, places a dot over the function name to represent a time derivative.  If ''y'' = ''ƒ''(''t''), then
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{y}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; and &amp;emsp; &lt;math&gt;\ddot{y}&lt;/math&gt;
denote, respectively, the first and second derivatives of ''y'' with respect to ''t''.  This notation is used exclusively for [[time derivative]]s, meaning that the independent variable of the function represents [[time]].  It is very common in [[physics]] and in mathematical disciplines connected with physics such as [[differential equation]]s.  While the notation becomes unmanageable for high-order derivatives, in practice only very few derivatives are needed.

===Euler's notation===

[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]]'s notation uses a [[differential operator]] ''D'', which is applied to a function ''ƒ'' to give the first derivative ''Df''. The second derivative is denoted ''D''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''ƒ'', and the ''n''th derivative is denoted ''D''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;''ƒ''.

If ''y'' = ''ƒ''(''x'') is a dependent variable, then often the subscript ''x'' is attached to the ''D'' to clarify the independent variable ''x''.
Euler's notation is then written
:&lt;math&gt;D_x y\,&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; or &amp;emsp; &lt;math&gt;D_x f(x)\,&lt;/math&gt;,
although this subscript is often omitted when the variable ''x'' is understood, for instance when this is the only variable present in the expression.

Euler's notation is useful for stating and solving [[linear differential equation]]s.

# All values are rounded to three significant figures. Values less than 1×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; are shown with appropriate SI prefixes to avoid a large number of leading zeros.
# The [[:w:IACS|IACS]] value of 58.0 MS/m is used as the conductivity of copper.
# These calculations do ''not'' take into account AC effects such as the [[:w:skin effect|skin effect]] - perform suitable calculations before using in a high-frequency application. Grid mains frequencies (50-60 Hz) should not have a noticeable effect, as the skin depth is over 8mm.
# A density of copper of 8920 kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is used to derive the mass
# An allowance of 750 kcmil/A is generally sufficient for calculating current capacity. The more relaxed 500 kcmil/A is an absolute maximum.
# The values are guidelines − exact values will depend on the type of wire and operating conditions such as ambient temperature, thermal conductivity of the surroundings.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The table below shows various data including both the resistance of the various wire gauges and the allowable current (ampacity) based on plastic insulation. The diameter information in the table applies to ''solid'' wires. Stranded wires are calculated by calculating the equivalent cross sectional copper area. Fusing Current (melting wire) is estimated based on 25°C. The table below assumes DC, or AC frequencies equal to or less than 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, and '''does not''' take skin effect into account.  Turns of wire is on a best-case scenario when winding tightly packed coils with no insulation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===&lt;center&gt;Length of a Plane Curve&lt;/center&gt;===

The graph of &lt;math&gt;y = x^{\frac {3}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; is a curve in the x-y plane.  How long is that curve?  A definite integral needs endpoints and we specify x = 0 and x = 4.  The first problem is to know what &quot;length function&quot; to integrate.

&lt;p&gt;Here is the unofficial reasoning that gives the length of the curve.  A straight piece has &lt;math&gt;(\Delta x)^2 + (\Delta y)^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Within that right triangle, the height &lt;math&gt;\Delta y&lt;/math&gt; is the slope &lt;math&gt;\left (\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x}\right)&lt;/math&gt; times &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;.  This secant slope is close to the slope of the curve.  Thus &lt;math&gt;\Delta y&lt;/math&gt; is approximately &lt;math&gt;\left (\frac {\operatorname {d}y}{\operatorname {d}x}\right)\Delta x&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;\Delta s \approx \sqrt{(\Delta x)^2 + \left (\frac {\operatorname {d}y}{\operatorname {d}x}\right)^2(\Delta x)^2} = \sqrt{1 + \left (\frac {\operatorname {d}y}{\operatorname {d}x}\right)^2}\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; (1)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now add these pieces and make them smaller.  The infinitesimal triangle has &lt;math&gt;(\operatorname {d}s)^2 = (\operatorname {d}x)^2 + (\operatorname {d}y)^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Think of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname {d}s&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1 + \left(\frac {\operatorname {d}y}{\operatorname {d}x}\right)^2}\operatorname {d}x&lt;/math&gt; and integrate:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;center&gt;'''length of curve''' = &lt;math&gt;\int \operatorname {d}s = \int \sqrt {1 + \left(\frac {\operatorname {d}y}{\operatorname {d}x}\right)^2}\operatorname {d}x&lt;/math&gt;.  (2)&lt;/p&gt;

      <comment>/* The Lessons and Reference/Лекције и Препоруке/Lekcije i Preporuke */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction/Предговор/Predgovor==

This book aims to be a complete guide to the Serbian language. From the basics, to the most advanced concepts of grammar and speech. It also aims to provide some miscellaneous information in relation to Serbia and the Serbian language (for example: history of the Serbian language, different dialects, how the Serbian language evolved, etcetera).

==The Lessons and Reference/Лекције и Препоруке/Lekcije i Preporuke==
The lessons are put into levels. Each level focuses on a certain part of Serbian, to help build up your knowledge of the language, also known simply as Serbian. For example, the first level is mostly vocabulary. After studying and learning all the levels and lessons, hopefully the reader will be able to speak Serbian fluently. The levels are mainly for people who want to learn Serbian seriously as another language. If you wish to learn some of the language quickly because of business, a holiday or just out of curiosity, the reference is here for a quick guide. If you are familiar with another Slavic language (cf. Russian, Polish , Croatian , Czech, etc...), then you are at an advantage as Serbian shares the same noun declinations and sentence structures as her sister languages.

Reference is not a guide, however nor is it similar to the lessons. It is large portions of this South Slavic language put into a small area so the reader can look up verbs quickly without having to go through the lessons to find it. However, if you want to learn some more vocabulary, please use Level 1, not Reference to look up the word you want. Level 1 is not rigidly structured, so it is easy to use, like a dictionary.

==Under Construction/У Изради/U Izradi==
This book is currently under construction. The squares next to each page, level or lesson, shows whether the content inside is completed or not. Below shows what stages these squares show:

      <text xml:space="preserve">While UV Maps may be the technical terms for the tools used in this tutorial, this tutorial does not discuss what UV Maps are in detail. It tells us more about ways to put images onto 3D faces. Using UV Maps as shown in the tutorial is just one of them.

It is better to add another description to the title in order to explain the functions demonstrated by this tutorial, instead of just using a technical term. A Noob may not understand it fully yet. There is no harm in adding a more descriptive title, as long as it is not too long. It hels in searching for the right tutorial.

I amended it because I actually forgot where this tutorial was originally. If I can forget in just a few days, imagine what will happen to me in a few years time. It is not easy to search the entire tutorial to get back the original tutorial. This happened to me so many times, wasting my time hunting for the tutorial, that I somehow forgot.

We should all agree to add more descriptions to the titles instead of sabotaging it by deleting them. You can improve it if you like but it should reflect what the tutorial is all about. If you just want to know about UV Maps, better read the manual.

I shall revert back to my original amendment.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{honor_header|1|2011|Recreation|North American Division}}

'''Note:''' These requirements can be done in a backyard pool (2-3 feet deep) with adult supervision. They do not require a lifeguard or water safety instructor.

==1. Enter and exit the water un-assisted.==
The point is to teach how to get in and out of a pool without assistance and safely.
==2. While holding your breath, fully submerge your face under water for five seconds.==
Demonstrate water skill/task.

==3. Alternately inhale through the mouth above the surface and blow bubbles through the mouth/nose, with face completely submerged, seven times rhythmically and continuously.==
This would be a good opportunity to tell the story of Naaman as found in [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Kings+5&amp;version=NKJV  2 Kings 5].

==4. Open your eyes under water and retrieve submerged objects two times.==
An excellent motivational object to use for this is a large coin such as a quarter or a silver dollar.  This serves as motivation only if you agree to let the Pathfinder keep the coin once it is retrieved the second time.

==5. Front float for five seconds.==
Demonstrate water skill/task.

==6. Front glide for two body lengths.==
Demonstrate water skill/task.

==7. Back float for fifteen seconds.==
Demonstrate water skill/task.

==8. Holding on to the side of the pool, kick with your feet for twenty seconds.==
Demonstrate water skill/task.

==9. Using arm and leg motion, swim five body lengths.==
Demonstrate water skill/task.

==10. Learn to put on a Life Jacket and float for thirty seconds.==
Demonstrate water skill/task.

==11. Demonstrate water safety by:==
===a. How to call for help in case of an emergency.===
How you call for help depends on who needs help, and where you are when help is required.  
*If you are calling for help for someone else and have access to a telephone, dial 911.  
*If you are calling for help for someone else and you are in the water too, yell &quot;Help!&quot; as loud as you can.  If there is a lifeguard present, go to him or her as quickly as you can and tell them someone is in trouble.
*If you yourself need help while in the water, call out for it and wave your arms.

===b. Learn how to release a cramp.===
The most frequent muscle to suffer a cramp from swimming is the calf muscle.  To release a calf cramp while swimming, float on your back, stretch your legs out in front of yourself, and point your toes toward your head while pushing your heel out away from your head.  This will stretch the calf muscle.

===c. Demonstrate reaching assist.===
Firmly brace yourself on a pool deck, pier or shoreline, and reach out to the person with any object that will extend your reach, such as a pole, oar, paddle, tree branch, shirt, belt or towel. 
If no equipment is available, you can perform a reaching assist by lying down and extending your arm or leg for the person to grab.

===d. Learn at least ten safety rules when around water.===
#Learn to swim before you go into the water. Sounds silly, but many people think it will come naturally, and it really doesn’t.
#Swim near a lifeguard so help is available if you need it.
#Never swim alone.
#Supervise children closely, even when lifeguards are present
#Don't rely on flotation devices, such as rafts, you may lose them in the water.
#Alcohol and swimming don't mix.
#Protect your head, neck, and spine by never jumping or diving  into unfamiliar waters.
#As soon as you believe that you may be in trouble, call or wave for help.
#Follow regulations and lifeguard directions.
#Swim parallel to shore if you wish to swim long distances.

This wikibook is intended to help prepare and review for the Society of Acutaries (SoA) Financial Math (FM) exam also called Exam 2 by the Casualty Actuarial Society (CAS). If you are looking for a more general introduction to financial math or you don't know what the SoA FM exam is, then this text is probably not for you.

This text will try to follow the [http://www.beanactuary.org/exams/syllabi/2011-06-exam-fm.pdf SoA FM syllabus] with an emphasis on problem solving and financial calculator usage.

      <comment>/* Sing the lyrics */ added words to Minuet in C Book 1.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Sing the lyrics ==
This is a good activity to make younger children familiar with pieces that they are about to study. It also can help older students to memorize tricky musical passages.

For most of the pieces in Book 1, there can be lyrics found. Get hold of those, wherever you find them. They are not official, and so they tend to disappear. There are often several versions for one piece, so pick the one that you like most. Some lyrics can be found on the Internet:
*[http://www.sandiegosuzukischool.com/T27dChromeGR/lyrics.htm www.sandiegosuzukischool.com]
*[http://theheartstring.org/lyrics.htm theheartstring.org]

If you make up your own lyrics, you can also share them right here, like the following:

=== The Happy Farmer (Book 1) ===
(Lyrics by User:Stilfehler)

The happy farmer sings a happy song.&lt;br&gt;
He sings a line, he sings a rhyme&lt;br&gt;
With falling notes.

The happy farmer sings a happy song.&lt;br&gt;
He sings a line, he sings a rhyme&lt;br&gt;
With falling notes.

He picks them up&lt;br&gt;
To start another line.&lt;br&gt;
The happy farmer takes his instrument.&lt;br&gt;
He plays a tune on the bassoon&lt;br&gt;
With checkmark notes.

He picks them up&lt;br&gt;
To start another line.&lt;br&gt;
The happy farmer takes his instrument.&lt;br&gt;
He plays a tune on the bassoon&lt;br&gt;
With checkmark notes.

''Comment: While you sing these lyrics, you may illustrate the words &quot;falling notes&quot; and &quot;checkmark notes&quot; with hand gestures.''

'''Rain''' (Lyrics by User:Stilfehler)

Rain, it’s gonna rain, my plans go all down the drain.&lt;br&gt;
It’s gonna pour, it’s gonna hail, despairing boredom will prevail.

It’s gonna rain, it’s gonna rain, my plans go all down the drain.&lt;br&gt;
It’s gonna pour, it’s gonna hail, despairing boredom will prevail.

I'd hoped to meet you in the park,&lt;br&gt;
To talk and play until it's dark,&lt;br&gt;
I'd dreamed of fun.&lt;br&gt;
Now I’m forever stuck here.

Rain, it’s gonna rain, my plans go all down the drain.&lt;br&gt;
It’s gonna hail, it’s gonna pour, so I can’t see you anymore.

I'd hoped to meet you in the park, etc.

=== Paganini, Witches’ Dance (Book 2) ===

'''Pirate Song''' (Lyrics by User:Stilfehler)

Hoo-ked hoo-ked bowing,&lt;br&gt;
Hoo-ked hoo-ked bowing,&lt;br&gt;
Hoo-ked hoo-ked bowing,&lt;br&gt;
Ar-pe-ggio, Ar-pe-ggio, Arrr.

Hoo-ked hoo-ked bowing,&lt;br&gt;
Hoo-ked hoo-ked bowing,&lt;br&gt;
Hoo-ked hoo-ked bowing,&lt;br&gt;
Ar-pe-ggio, Ar-pe-ggio, Arrr.

Ar-pe-ggio, Ar-pe-ggio, Arrr.&lt;br&gt;
Ar-pe-ggio, Ar-pe-ggio, Arrr.&lt;br&gt;
Ar-pe-ggio, Ar-pe-ggio, Arrr,&lt;br&gt;
and Ar-pe-ggio, Ar-pe-ggio, Arrr.

Hoo-ked hoo-ked bowing,&lt;br&gt;
Hoo-ked hoo-ked bowing,&lt;br&gt;
Hoo-ked hoo-ked bowing, Arrr.

Hoo-ked hoo-ked bowing,&lt;br&gt;
Hoo-ked hoo-ked bowing,&lt;br&gt;
Hoo-ked hoo-ked hoo-ked triple stair.&lt;br&gt;
And when the pirates&lt;br&gt;
play violin nobody cares&lt;br&gt;
if they curse or they swear.

'''Grandma has a little clock''' (Lyrics by User:Stilfehler)

Grandma has a little clock.&lt;br&gt;
It can chime and it can ring&lt;br&gt;
And it can go tick-tock.&lt;br&gt;
It goes tick-e-tick-e-tock-e.&lt;br&gt;
It goes tick-e-tick-e-tock-e.&lt;br&gt;
It’s a wo-on-drous, wo-on-drous thing.

It goes tick-e-tick-e-tock-e.&lt;br&gt;
It’s a pre-ci-ous, pre-ci-ous thing.

Ev'ry day at three o’clock&lt;br&gt;
Whe-en the big ha-and moves up close to twe-elve,&lt;br&gt;
We will ga-the-e-er by the clock,&lt;br&gt;
Waiting for the chime,&lt;br&gt;
Waiting for the chime,&lt;br&gt;
A-and listen closely,&lt;br&gt;
Listen closely,&lt;br&gt;
Listen closely:&lt;br&gt;
1 and then comes&lt;br&gt;
2 and then comes&lt;br&gt;
3 and then comes

It goes tick-e-tick-e-tock-e.&lt;br&gt;
It’s a pre-ci-ous, pre-ci-ous thing.

Grandma’s clock chi-mes so endea-earingly,&lt;br&gt;
Sweet a-and sweet a-and sweet a-and&lt;br&gt;
Dea-ear to my heart. The&lt;br&gt;
Clock chi-mes so endea-earingly,&lt;br&gt;

Grandpa has a hearing aid.&lt;br&gt;
Grandpa has a hearing aid.&lt;br&gt;

Minuet in C by Bach Book 1 as &quot;SANTA's FLIGHT AROUND THE WORLD&quot; 

“Have you been good this year? 
Is Santa coming to you?
It is December now! 
Nearly Christmas time.

I have been good this year 
Homework and chores all done. 
I want a red bicycle 
And coat and hat.

Up at the North Pole its cold,
Santa has loaded his sleigh, 
Sacks full of toys and games 
For you and me.

Soon he will fly down South, 
Then I may see him again, 
Dressed all in red from his hat to his socks.

Do you think he might get stuck On the high Eiffel Tower?
 Or on the sails of the Opera House? 
Or on the Torch of the Statue of Liberty?

Or even worse, he may  fall off the roof!” [Owwwwww].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== VNPI ==

The article does not mention that the classification system was developed retrospectively and has not been validated in prospective studies nor in different retrospective studies of other institutions.  Prospective randomized trials (Wong 2006, JCO) reported in the DFCI study of women with DCIS and &gt; 1 cm margins and low grade (1-2) disease in the observation arm was stopped due to meeting early stopping rules for excessive failures.  This is the only trial that looked at the general critera of the VNPI with the hope of identifying need for treatment post lumpectomy.  Wong looked at mammography size, rather than pathologic size in stratifying results.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I believe the statement regarding voltage leading current through a capacitor is incorrect (in the section labeled &quot;Phase Angle&quot;.)  Everything else I've read indicates current leads voltage, with the phrase &quot;ELI the ICE man&quot; being an (english) memory aid, Voltage leads Current through and inductor, Current leads Voltage through a capacitor. a newbie

:ELI the ICE man agrees.  That was the mnemonic I was taught over 25 years ago.  ELI means voltage (e) leads current (i) in an inductor (L).  ICE means current (i) leads voltage (e) in a capacitor(C). --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Jomegat|contribs]]) 23:21, 9 May 2011 (UTC)</text>

__NOTOC__

==History==

{{Wikipedia|Monkey_(programming_language)}}

Monkey is a BASIC dialect programming language that translates Monkey code into multiple cross-platforms. Currently the supported target platforms include Windows, Mac OS X, Android, iOS, HTML5, Flash and XNA.

Monkey is the latest programming language by Blitz Research Limited, following BlitzMax (2004) and BlitzBasic (2000), two prior BASIC programming dialects from the same author.

==Compilation==

Monkey code is translated into the target language via the Trans tool and into a native compiler depending on the target platform. Monkey requires the use of other compilers and development kits to reach the end target. This process is largely automated with the accompanying IDE, ''Monk'' (2011) and ''Ted'' (2012).

==Modules==

Modules provide the runtime functionality of Monkey. They are stored in the '''modules''' directory inside the Monkey directory, and accessed via the Import commands.

==Code Example==
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Function Main:Bool()
	Local hex:Int = $f0c090

	HexToColour(hex)
	
	Return True
End Function

Function HexToColour:Void(hex:Int)
	Local r:Int = hex Shr 16 &amp; $0000ff
	Local g:Int = hex Shr 8 &amp; $0000ff
	Local b:Int = hex &amp; $0000ff
	
	Print r+&quot;:&quot;+g+&quot;:&quot;+b
End&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Looking at the code of a function ==

* You can type the name of the function in the console without any round brackets after the name. This will print the code of the function in the console. 
* You can also use the &lt;code&gt;page()&lt;/code&gt; function which opens a new editor window and prints the code of the function in this editor. 
* You can also use the &lt;code&gt;trCopy()&lt;/code&gt; function in the '''TinnR''' package to copy the code of the function. Then you just have to paste it in a text editor to have a look at it. 

Here is an example with the &lt;code&gt;lm()&lt;/code&gt; function. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; lm
&gt; page(lm)
&gt; library(TinnR)
&gt; trCopy(lm)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Creating your own function ==

=== A simple function without argument which doesn't return anything ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; fn &lt;- function(){
+ print(&quot;hello&quot;)
+ }
&gt; fn()
[1] &quot;hello&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Returning an object ===

By default the value of the last line is returned. In the following example, we have a simple function with two objects. The last one is returned. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; test &lt;- function(){
+ x &lt;-1
+ z &lt;- 2
+ }
&gt; res &lt;- test()
&gt; res
[1] 2
&lt;/source&gt;

The function can return an object using &lt;tt&gt;return()&lt;/tt&gt;. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; test &lt;- function(){
+ x &lt;-1
+ z &lt;- 2
+ return(x)
+ }
&gt; res &lt;- test()
&gt; res
[1] 1
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Adding arguments ===

It is possible to add arguments.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
square &lt;- function(x){
	x2 &lt;- x^2
	return(x2)
	}
square(x = 2)
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;...&lt;/code&gt; argument means that you can add other arguments which will be passed to functions inside the function.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
plot2 &lt;- function(x,...){
	plot(x, type = &quot;l&quot;, ...)
	}
plot2(runif(100), main = &quot;line plot&quot;, col = &quot;red&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

It is possible to add a dataframe as argument&lt;ref&gt;http://r.789695.n4.nabble.com/Optional-data-argument-for-a-function-tp850247p850247.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Here is an example : 

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
redplot &lt;- function(z, y, data, env=parent.frame()) {
       if(!missing(data)){
			z &lt;- data[,deparse(substitute(z))]
			y &lt;- data[,deparse(substitute(y))]
			}
	plot(z,y, col = &quot;red&quot;, pch = 15)
} 

mydat &lt;- data.frame(vm = rnorm(10),output = rnorm(10))
redplot(vm,output,data=mydat)
&lt;/source&gt;

For estimation commands it is possible to add formulas as arguments.
For instance, we can create our own function for ordinary least square using a formula interface.
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
ols &lt;- function(formula, data = list()){
	mf &lt;- model.frame(formula=formula, data=data)
	X &lt;- model.matrix(attr(mf, &quot;terms&quot;), data=mf)
	y &lt;- model.response(mf)
	beta &lt;- solve(t(X)%*%X)%*%t(X)%*%y
	se &lt;- sqrt( 1/(nrow(X) - ncol(X)) * sum((y - X%*%beta)^2) * diag(solve(t(X)%*%X)))
	res &lt;- cbind(beta,se)
	colnames(res)&lt;- c(&quot;Coefficients&quot;,&quot;Standard errors&quot;)
	return(res)
	}
N &lt;- 100
u &lt;- rnorm(N)
x &lt;- rnorm(N) + 1
y &lt;- 1 + x + u
ols(y~x)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Recursive functions ==

R supports [[w:Recursion_(computer_science)|recursive functions]]. The function below computes [[w:Fibonacci_number|Fibonacci numbers]] recursively.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; fib &lt;- function(n) if (n&gt;2) c(fib(n-1),sum(tail(fib(n-1),2))) else if (n&gt;=0) rep(1,n)
&gt; fib(10)
 [1]  1  1  2  3  5  8 13 21 34 55
&lt;/source&gt;

== Functions as Objects ==
R functions can be treated as objects
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; a &lt;- function(n) function(a) runif(a)
&gt; b &lt;- a(1)
&gt; b(10)
 [1] 0.8726873 0.9512367 0.5971435 0.5540743 0.6378967 0.4030071 0.2750673 0.1777123 0.6960378 0.3969920
&lt;/source&gt;
This can be useful when wanting to make many different kinds of functions
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; a &lt;- list()
&gt; b &lt;- function(i){ i; function() runif(i)}
&gt; for (i in 1:10) a[[i]] &lt;- b(i)
&gt; a[[1]]()
[1] 0.2617396
&gt; a[[2]]()
[1] 0.8822248 0.3374574
&gt; a[[3]]()
[1] 0.0348156 0.4212788 0.6107646
&lt;/source&gt;

== Higher-order functions ==

You can use [[w:Higher-order_function|higher-order functions]] in '''R'''. Contrary to common belief, using them instead of loops, is not faster, because the apply function has a for-loop inside its definition. Use them only to improve clarity of your code. (Reference: Patrick Burns, The R Inferno, p. 24)

=== apply ===

apply is the most basic of R's [[w:Map (higher-order function)|map functions]]. lapply, sapply and mapply are convenient interfaces for apply that work on lists, vectors and multiple vectors respectively. 

apply takes as arguments an array, a vector of the dimension to map along and a function. The following example is based on the apply documentation. It uses apply to compute column and row sums of a matrix.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
x &lt;- matrix(round(rnorm(100)),10,10)
col.sums &lt;- apply(x, 2, sum)
row.sums &lt;- apply(x, 1, sum)
&lt;/source&gt;


=== tapply ===

tapply is similar to apply, but applies a function to each cell of a ragged array, that is to each (non-empty) group of values given by a unique combination of the levels of certain factors.

&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; x1 &lt;- rnorm(10)
&gt; x2 &lt;- sample(1:2, 10, replace = T)
&gt; cbind(x1,x2)
              x1 x2
 [1,] -1.7905021  1
 [2,]  1.2908169  2
 [3,] -2.1902513  2
 [4,]  0.4845488  1
 [5,]  0.2281593  1
 [6,]  0.2201302  1
 [7,]  2.1574243  1
 [8,]  0.5789705  2
 [9,]  1.3315188  1
[10,] -1.0029822  2
&gt; tapply(x1, x2, sum)
        1         2 
 2.631279 -1.323446 
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Reduce ===

This function from the Reduce documentation cumulatively adds
&lt;source lang=&quot;rsplus&quot;&gt;
&gt; cadd &lt;- function(x) Reduce(&quot;+&quot;, x, accumulate = TRUE)
&gt; cadd(1:10)
 [1]  1  3  6 10 15 21 28 36 45 55
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Interest== 

A basic definition of interest is the price paid for obtaining, or price received for providing, money or capital in a credit transaction. For example, today Brian borrows $10,000 from Ivan and agrees to pay him $10,500 in one year.  In this example the $10,000 is the principal that Ivan invested over a period of 1 year. After 1 year, the accumulated value is $10,500. $500 is the amount of interest Brian paid Ivan. 

===Interest Rate (Rate of Interest)===

An interest rate or the rate of interest is how much is paid by a borrower as expressed as a percent of the borrowed capital. In the previous example $500 dollars of interest accrued at the end of 1 year over a $10,000 loan. 

&lt;math&gt; {\operatorname $500 \over\operatorname $10,000} = 5% &lt;/math&gt;


Thus the interest rate for this loan was 5% and unless otherwise stated in the examination question, rates are expressed as annual rates. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.beanactuary.org/exams/syllabi/Notation_term2FM.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Loans can and often are over multiple periods and the exact terms of the loan can depend on the interest type.


====Simple Interest====
Brian and Ivan can agree to use '''simple interest'''. The final amount of interest paid is simply the original loan amount times the interest rate times the number of periods. 

:&lt;math&gt;I_{simp} = k \cdot i \cdot t&lt;/math&gt;

;Example:Ivan invests $10000 into a bank account which pays simple interest with an annual rate of 5%. Find the balance in Ivan's account after 2 years. 


{{hidden|Solution|
 &lt;math&gt;I_{simp} = k \cdot i \cdot t&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\ I = 10,000(.05 \cdot 2) &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\ I = $1,000 &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\ $10,000 + $1,000 = $11,000&lt;/math&gt;
The final balance in Ivan's account will be his original investment plus the interest accrued over two years. This comes out to $11,000. 
}}

====Compound Interest====
'''Compound interest''' arises when interest is added to the principal, so that from that moment on, the interest that has been added also itself earns interest. This addition of interest to the principal is called compounding. A bank account, for example, may have its interest compounded every year: in this case, an account with $1000 initial principal and 20% interest per year would have a balance of $1200 at the end of the first year, $1440 at the end of the second year, and so on. In the case of compound interest, the accumulated value at the end of t periods is 
:&lt;math&gt;\ A(t) = k (1+i)^t &lt;/math&gt;
;Example:Ivan invests $10000 into a bank account which pays compound interest with an annual rate of 5%. Find the balance in Ivan's account after 2 years. 


{{hidden|Solution|
 &lt;math&gt;\ A(t) = k (1+i)^t &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\ A(t) = 10,000 (1+.05)^2 &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;\ A(t) =  11025&lt;/math&gt;
The final balance in Ivan's account comes to $11,025.
}}

==Amount and Accumulation function==

===Amount function===

A(t) is defined as the '''amount function''' where A(t) denotes the value of an investment at time t. For this function there are two general assumptions.
* For each &lt;math&gt;t \geq 0, A(t) &gt;0 &lt;/math&gt;.
* A is nondecreasing.

&lt;br /&gt;
It should also be noted that the amount of interest earned over the period &lt;math&gt;\ [s,t] &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\ A(t) - A(s) &lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;
The '''effective rate''' of interest earned in the period &lt;math&gt;\ [s,t] &lt;/math&gt; is :&lt;math&gt; \frac{A(t) - A(s) }{A(s)} &lt;/math&gt;

;Example:Ivan invests $2000 into a bank account with an interest rate of 5% and has an amount function of &lt;math&gt;\ A(t) = k e^{0.5 \cdot t \cdot i }  &lt;/math&gt; What is the effective rate of interest in the third year?


{{hidden|Solution|
 &lt;math&gt; i_{[s,t]}=\frac{A(t) - A(s) }{A(s)} &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt; i_{[s,t]}=\frac{ k e^{0.5 \cdot t \cdot i } -  k e^{0.5 \cdot s \cdot i } }{ k e^{0.5 \cdot s \cdot i }}  &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt; i_{[3,4]}=\frac{ e^{0.5 \cdot 4 \cdot 0.05 } -  e^{0.5 \cdot 3 \cdot 0.05 } }{ e^{0.5 \cdot 3 \cdot 0.05 }}  &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt; i_{[3,4]}= 0.0253  &lt;/math&gt;
The effective interest rate in the third year is 2.53%
}}

===Accumulation function===
a(t) is defined as the '''accumulation function''' where a(t) denotes the value of an investment at time t where the initial investment is 1. This is simply a special case of the amount function. The amount function and accumulation function share a simple relationship. 
:&lt;math&gt; A(t) = k \cdot a(t) &lt;/math&gt;
;Example:An investment's accumulation function is &lt;math&gt;\ a(t) = {t^2}  &lt;/math&gt; . The value of the investment at time t=4 is 80. What was the value of the initial investment?


{{hidden|Solution|
 &lt;math&gt; A(t) = k \cdot a(t) &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt; A(4) = k \cdot a(4) &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt; 80 = k \cdot 4^{2} &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt; k = 5  &lt;/math&gt;
The initial investment was 5. 
}}

==Present and Future value==
As we've seen money has a time value so that $1 today is worth more than $1 a year from now. Given an effective annual interest rate of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; compounded annually over &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; years:
:&lt;math&gt;PV(1+i)^t = FV&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;PV&lt;/math&gt; is the '''present value''' and &lt;math&gt;FV&lt;/math&gt; is the '''future value'''. 
&lt;math&gt;(1+i)&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''interest factor'''. Note that
:&lt;math&gt;PV = FV (1+i)^{-t}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;v=\frac{1}{1+i}&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''discount factor''' and is denoted as &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;.
;Example: In exchange for your car John has promised to pay you $5,000 in 1 year and $10,000 in 3 years. Using an annual effective interest rate of 5% find the present value of these payments. 

{{hidden|Solution|
 &lt;math&gt; PV = 5,000v + 10,000v^3 &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt; v = 1.05^{-1} &lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt; PV = 13400.28 &lt;/math&gt;
}}
Using accumulation function &lt;math&gt;a(t)&lt;/math&gt; notation 
* &lt;math&gt; \frac{a(n)}{a(n-1)} = &lt;/math&gt;The '''n-th year interest factor'''.
* &lt;math&gt;i_n = \frac{a(n)-a(n-1)}{a(n-1)} = &lt;/math&gt;the effective rate of interest in the n-th year.
* &lt;math&gt;v_n = \frac{a(n-1)}{a(n)} =&lt;/math&gt; the n-th year discount factor.
* &lt;math&gt;d_n = \frac{a(n)-a(n-1)}{a(n)} =&lt;/math&gt;  the effective rate of '''discount''' in the n-th year. 

Note that

* &lt;math&gt;v_n = 1- d_n&lt;/math&gt;
*  &lt;math&gt;d_n = \frac{i_n}{1+i_n}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt; i_n = \frac{d_n}{1-d_n}&lt;/math&gt; 
===Discount===
Interest has been so far defined as the payment required at the end of the period, however there is also the rate of '''discount''', denoted by &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;, which is a measure of the interest paid at the beginning of the period. For example, if Brian borrows $100 at a rate of interest of 10% over a period, then he will receive $100 now and he will have an obligation of $100 dollars at the end of the period plus $10 in interest. However, if Brian borrows $100 at a 10% rate of discount, he will only receive $90 now and he'll have an obligation of $100 at the end of the period. 

&lt;math&gt;d_n = \frac{A(n)-A(n-1)}{A(n)} = \frac{I_n}{A(n)}&lt;/math&gt;

;Example: Brian borrows $45 at a 5% annual rate of interest. Find the annual rate of discount.  


{{hidden|Solution|
 
&lt;math&gt;d \frac{I_n}{A(n)}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;d \frac{45*0.05}{45*1.05}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;d = 0.0476&lt;/math&gt; 
}}
===Examples===
;Example 1: If i = 6.5%, what are &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;?
{{hidden|Solution|
 &lt;math&gt;d = \frac{i}{1+i} = \frac{0.065}{1.065}  =6.103&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;v = (1+i)^{-1} = 1.065^{-1} = .93896&lt;/math&gt; OR
 &lt;math&gt;v = 1 - d = 1 -0.06103 = 9.3896&lt;/math&gt; 
}}
;Example 2: What is the present value of $9,000 to be received in 10 years at an annual effective rate of discount of 8%.  
{{hidden|Solution|
 &lt;math&gt;PV = v^n FV&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;PV = (1-d)^n \cdot 9,000&lt;/math&gt; 
 &lt;math&gt;PV = (1-.08)^10 \cdot 9,000&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;PV = 3,909.5&lt;/math&gt;
}} 
;Example 3: At time &lt;math&gt;t = 0&lt;/math&gt;, Ivan deposits $260 into a fund with an annual discount factor of 0.95. Find the fund's value at time &lt;math&gt;t = 3.75&lt;/math&gt;.
{{hidden|Solution|
 &lt;math&gt;PV = v^n FV&lt;/math&gt; 
 &lt;math&gt; 260 = 0.95^{3.75} FV&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt; FV = 315.15 &lt;/math&gt; 
}}
;Example 4: Thor invests $250 into a bank account. One year later, his account is $260. 
# Find the effective annual interest rate Thor earned that year.
# Find the effective annual discount rate Thor earned that year. 
{{hidden|Solution|
 &lt;math&gt;i = \frac{260-250}{250}&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;i = .04&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;d = \frac{260-250}{260}&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;d = .03846 &lt;/math&gt;
}}

==Nominal vs Effective rates==
So far when dealing with compound interest we've only seen the interest compounded annually. That is to say, the interest is only added to the principal once a year. To illustrate this, Ivan invests $1000 into a bank account that offers 10% interest compounded annually. At the end of the first year, the account is $1000 + $100 in interest. At this point the principal earning interest is $1100 so that at the end of the second year the interest earned is $111 and the principal is $1100. However, the interest could be compounded more frequently. Suppose that instead of being compounded annually, the interest is compounded semi-annually. At the end of 6 months, the interest is $50 and added to the $1000 principal. The new principal is $1,050. At the end of the first year, the interest earned over the last 6 months is $52.5. After one year, the bank account contains $1,102.5. Notice that the interest rate is still 10% annually, however the '''effective''' annual rate of interest is 10.25%.
:&lt;math&gt;i_n = \frac{1,102.5-1000}{1000}=0.01025 &lt;/math&gt;
10% is the nominal interest rate and 10.25% is the effective rate. A nominal rate of interest compounded ''m'' times a year is denoted as &lt;math&gt;i^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt;.  The relationship between the effective rate and nominal rate of interest is:
:&lt;math&gt;i_{effective} = {(1+\frac{i^{(m)}}{m})}^{m} -1&lt;/math&gt;
;Example 1: Loki borrows $200 from Thor and repays him $205 in one month.
# Find the monthly effective interest rate, which Loki is charged for the loan. 
# Find the annual nominal interest rate compounded monthly.
# Find the annual effective interest rate. 
{{hidden|Solution| 
 &lt;math&gt;i = \frac{205-200}{200} = 0.025&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;i^{(m)} = 12 \cdot 0.025 = 0.3&lt;/math&gt;
 &lt;math&gt;i = (1.025)^{12} = 0.3448&lt;/math&gt;
The monthly effective rate was 2.5%. The nominal rate will simply be 12 times the monthly effective rate, which is 30%. Finally, the effective annual rate is the monthly effective rate compounded 12 times, which is about 34.5%
}}
;Example2: Xiao Yu invests $7,500 into a bank account with a nominal interest rate of 8% convertible quarterly. How much does she have in the account after 6 years?
{{hidden|Solution|
 &lt;math&gt;7,500(1+\frac{0.08}{4})^{6 \cdot 4} = 12,063.28&lt;/math&gt;  
}}

==Inflation and real rate of interest==
==Force of interest  ==
So far we've said that the effective rate of interest earned in a period &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is  
:&lt;math&gt;i_n = \frac{a(n)-a(n-1)}{a(n-1)} &lt;/math&gt;.

This gives the interest rate earned over a period however. We can also find the rate of interest over an interval smaller than the period. 
:&lt;math&gt;i = \frac{a(t)-a(t-h)}{h \cdot a(t-h)} &lt;/math&gt;.
If we have a continuous accumulation function we can also measure the the interest acting at a given moment called the '''force of interest''' which is denoted as &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. 

:&lt;math&gt; \delta_t = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac{a(t)-a(t-h)}{h \cdot a(t-h)}= \frac{a'(t)}{a(t)} = \frac{d}{dt} \ln a (t)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;e^{\int_0^{t}\delta_r dr } = a(t)&lt;/math&gt;
===Examples===
;Example1: Ivan invests $10,000 at a force of interest of 3%. Find the accumulated value at the end of 7.25 years.  
{{hidden|Solution|
&lt;math&gt;e^{\int_0^{t}\delta_r dr } = a(t)&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;10,000 \cdot e^{.03*7.25} = 12,429.65&lt;/math&gt; 
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Long before BarCamp, there were conferences. And they sort of sucked in various ways. Lots of people found that the interesting content at conferences wasn't so much the formal presentations as the discussion that took place in the hallway, the &quot;lobby track&quot; as it has come to be known. It seems quite strange: you pay sometimes quite a sizeable amount of money to attend a conference, and then you don't spend any time actually listening to the material presented at the conference. But there is a problem with the lobby track that doesn't exist with the formal tracks: it doesn't necessarily scale to include everyone. If you are a little bit shy or socially awkward, perhaps you don't get talked to if you try and enjoy the lobby track. What if there were events where the formal track and the lobby track were very, very similar?

Enter the unconference. The unconference is a conference that every attendee is allowed to participate in, much like anyone can have a blog, or anyone can edit Wikipedia. The distinction between speakers and listeners is blurred because if you are attending, you will probably be speaking also. Sessions are less like lectures and more like conversations. There are lots of small groups. To use an academic analogy, it is more like a seminar than a lecture; organisers and speakers are more like convenors than lecturers. The traditional conference panel is rarely present in unconferences.

There were plenty of unconferences before BarCamp. Since the 1980s there have been &quot;open space&quot; events. The blogger and technologist Dave Winer ran an event called BloggerCon in the early 2000s, which was often described as an &quot;unconference&quot;. Winer describes the format of these events like this:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We don't have speakers, panels or an audience. We ''do'' have discussions and sessions, and each session has a discussion leader. Think of the discussion leader as a reporter who is creating a story with quotes from the people in the room. So, instead of having a panel with an audience we just have people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scripting.com/2006/06/15.html Scripting News 2006-06-15]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There are other rules: generally, explicit pitching of companies and pimping of products is discouraged. The unconference format is malleable though and is more like a general description of an overall style or genre: much like rock music or painting covers a wide diversity and variety of things but have some common threads or family resemblances between them. For instance, the Pecha Kucha format is one format that has evolved that is also considered to be an unconference format, where participants speak while twenty slides are shown for twenty seconds each before automatically changing.

Conferences and unconferences are not avowed enemies: there have been unconferences held as tracks within larger conferences, like the Web 2.Open section of O'Reilly's Web 2.0 Conference.

The birth of BarCamp traces back to 2005. Tim O'Reilly of O'Reilly Publishing, a tech book company, had organised &quot;FooCamp&quot;, the Friends Of O'Reilly Camp, and invited select people to attend. But there were people who did not get an invitation...

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Housing=
&lt;br /&gt;
There are multiple options for housing when you travel abroad for a short time, including dorms, host family stays, and hotels.  You may also face the decision of choosing to stick together or splitting your group.  This section will give some insight into the many options you have as well as explore ways you can learn about the conditions in the particular area you will be visiting. &lt;br /&gt;

==Host Family Stays==
&lt;br /&gt;
Many students and travelers choose to seek a family with which to stay during their time abroad.  This is known as a host family stay, or home stay, and provides a highly unique opportunity to the traveler.  Typically homestays function through an organization, such as ''The International Homestay Agency'', ''Gohomestay.com'', and ''Federation EIL.''  These organizations are typically open to participation by those who are seeking a homestays, as well as those who are interested in hosting. Both future hosts and guests are required to fill out applications and the organization does their best to match them up to provide the best experience for both parties.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Homestay Agencies. Web. 11 May 2011. &lt;http://www.homestayagency.com/index.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
===Why Should I choose a homestay?=== 
&lt;br /&gt;
By living with a homestay, you will find yourself in an incredible immersion into the culture of the region you are in.  In this unfamiliar territory you will wake, eat, sleep, live, and talk with people who call it home.  You will have the chance to practice the language with native speakers, to participate in activities unique to the culture, and experience firsthand, the way of daily life with the people who live it. &lt;ref&gt;Homestay Agencies. Web. 11 May 2011. &lt;http://www.homestayagency.com./index.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
===Anything to Be Afraid of?===
&lt;br /&gt;
Regardless of whether you choose to live in a hotel, dorm, homestay, or another option, you will travel to a place that is different from what you know.  The climate, culture, habits, food, sanitation, living standards, family life, and expectations will be different from what you are accustomed to.  This however is nothing to be afraid of.  It is important to research these things prior to your journey, but know that information in a book or on a website may not actually be the case when you are abroad.  The best way to avoid fear is to ask questions and simply immerse yourself in the culture.  While joining an unknown family may be intimidating, it is an excellent way to learn about the country you are traveling to in an intimate way.



==Student Group Living==
&lt;br /&gt;

A possible living situation a student might face is student group living. This a is a broad term used to refer to a situation where students are living together. It could be an group of individual students from various parts of the world gathered for the purpose of studying abroad or a group of students from the same university sharing a space while overseas. Either way, there are a number of things to consider before and during your trip in a student group situation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Perhaps the most important thing is your relationship to those sharing the space with you. Having a civil relationship with these individuals can improve your overall experience drastically. Therefore, be conscience of your actions and how you treat the shared space. Respecting the possessions of others is very important. Generally, a code of conduct is issued to students living in a student-designated area. Your actions should generally comply with these different rules. For example, University Residences at Western Washington University has a Residential Community Handbook&lt;ref&gt;http://housing.wwu.edu/RCH/residential-conduct-policies.php#disruptive_behavior&lt;/ref&gt;. It outlines how a students should conduct themselves within their space identifying issues such as theft, noise, possession of alcohol and illegal substances, and more. Considering these guidelines can be very helpful in building amiable relationships with the individuals of the group.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

If conflict occurs, it is best to have a pre-established way to deal with it. By communicating with your roommates early on and discussing possible ways of handling potential conflict, you will hopefully be able to work through the conflict in an organized, civil manner. Before leaving, those of us going to Kenya during the summer of 2011 discussed this extensively. We took into consideration ways to avoid conflict, and way to handle negative situations when they occur. By doing this, we were able to open the channels for communication and articulate what the best way to approach these issues would be.

== Hotels ==

Hotels are beneficial to the communities they are built in. Many hotels though do not take advantage of this opportunity and end up exploiting the local communities. This occurs when the use beaches and areas that were once open for public access becomes prohibited to the people living in the region. Many hotels will buy the land, turning it into private property only to be enjoyed by travelers, who often have much more money than the local population. Some of these hotels are under corrupt management and the revenue does not circulate throughout the community.

Hotels do exist though where the local communities can benefit from their presence.  This usually requires more research on the traveler’s part though. Look into the community you are visiting and learn about the history. Who owns the hotel? Are local community members employed? Does the hotel’s location prevent local people’s access from natural resources and recreation?
If these hotels are owned and operated responsibly and sustainably, their presence can have a positive outcome in the community by creating jobs and a shift from other destructive industries (such as mining in Marinduque). 

Hostels represent an alternative to staying in a large and often expensive hotel. Companies like Hostels International (provide travelers with a vast list of hostels that are rated according to a star system representing the overall cleanliness, comfort and safety. Many of the hostels recommended are dormitory style so as a traveler you are given the opportunity to easily interact with other tourists and even community members.  

If you decide to stay in a hotel, you will be more isolated from the local community. If you still want to immerse yourself in the local community though, there are options for your hotel stay. For example, one company actually allows you to work at a hotel abroad in exchange for room and board expenses. This is similar to au pair jobs, but instead focuses on gaining experience in other industries like hospitality businesses.  These programs though usually have minimum stay requirements though and some level of language competency. 

Hotel safety is an important aspect to consider when traveling abroad and also requires research on the traveler’s part.  Tourists can be an easy target for local crime because they are often times unaware of their surroundings. Make sure to know if the area you are traveling to has issues with local crime, such as muggings. Tourists are advised to keep all valuables items out of plain sight, usually it is safest to keep them hid away in your hotel room. As a precaution, travelers are also advised to inform the front desk staff when they leave for the night and plan to return late. 

“Remember, when you travel abroad, that you are acting as an emissary of your country and culture. If you behave badly, it reflects badly not only on yourself, but on your home country as well.”

      <comment>/* Staying Safe */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Safety is whatever makes you comfortable. In this section we will be discussing different aspects of safe travel. There are many ways your can reduce the risk you will be exposed to while traveling, from blending in to following your instincts. It is important to do research about safely in the place you plan on traveling to before you get there. But don’t let it scare you! Have a plan for when you get to a new place and let people know where they can find you. Many people encourage using the buddy system when traveling, but don’t let that stop you from traveling on your own.

==Risk Reduction==
The best way to stay safe when you’re in a new place is to follow your instincts!  Sophie Geist, a student from UC Santa Cruiz, came back to Seattle after traveling on her own for 7 months in India doing service learning and independent travel. These were some of her insights into staying safe. While living in our familiar surroundings we don’t realize that intuition is always working for us, letting us know when something is safe or not. When we are out of our comfort zones those feelings of intuition get much stronger and that can be disconcerting. But follow those feelings, if you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, there is probably a reason for that. 

One great way to know if you are truly putting yourself in an unsafe situation or not is to get to know the people around you and to ask them what is safe and what is not. In some countries, foreigners are targeted for their assumed wealth. Depending on the country you choose to visit, you can certainly be perceived as a potential target. Being aware of the local conditions (i.e. how much things cost, necessary safety precautions) and customs, you can work to avoid being taken advantage of while abroad. Minimally, a tourist might experience this when they are charged substantially more than the market price. By being aware this and having a sense of the appropriate costs of things, you might be able to avoid being overcharged. Furthermore, having some knowledge about local customs can aid you in avoiding unacceptable behavior that could offend or further make you a target. A story by Monique Kerman, a Liberal Studies Professor at WWU, is an example of dangers you may not anticipate when you are in an unfamiliar environment. 

&quot;I was visiting Johannesburg and arrived at the Art Gallery about 30 mins before it opened at 10 or 11am. I figured since it was day and in the middle of downtown it would be safe. However, Sonnyboy, my cab driver whom I hired to drive me around all day, told me I should wait in the car rather than alone on the gallery steps. He said, &quot;Take a look around. Can you see how much you will stand out?&quot; This implied, of course, that I would be a target for mugging.&quot;

Sophie, as a woman traveling alone, would often get to know the women on the bus or in the market. They gave her great advice and then kept an eye out on her to make sure no one was bothering her. This is both a way to stay safe and a great way to make new friends!

==Pre-Planning==

To reduce your risk of being unsafe it is important to learn and educate yourselves about where you are going. Understanding the customs, traditions, religion, and language of where you will be visiting can improve your “street smarts” and keep you safe.  Foreign countries have very different laws and regulations to be aware of. You should become familiar with local conditions and laws so you know your rights and remain safe. 

Learning the basics of the language of where you will be traveling can be very helpful. Words such as hospital, water, pharmacy, yes/no etc. also, look up emergency numbers. All of this information can be found in traditional guide books. Guide books can be expensive, if you cant afford them look at used book stores. Some of the information will be different in the older books you find there (like hotels or restaurants) but safety, language and culture will be the same.   

Per-planning for a trip requires you to…
It is a good idea to create an itinerary that you can leave with your family members or friends. This could include a loose schedule of daily/weekly activities, cell phone numbers or local contact information (e.i. hotel/hostel number), arrival times, and flight information. Before leaving you should copy you passport, Visa, birth certificate so you can be contacted in case of an emergency.  We suggest signing up for the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program so the State Department can better assist you in an emergency as well. This is a free online service that the government offers so that if there is an emergence were you are visiting they know you are there and can help. 

Check out each countries description (but don't let it scare you!) and register with the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP)

==Buddy System==
The buddy system is a logical way to stay safe. Be aware of the safety concerns in the areas of the country that you are traveling to. Where is it safe to be alone versus places that are not? Having another individual with you reduces the risk getting lost or getting into an unwanted situation.  There are times and places that are safe to be alone but it is the travelers job to research those places beforehand.

Traveling with someone especially someone who knows the language is also a benefit. If you are traveling alone, leaving your contact and information about where you are going at the front desk or with a roommate is smart and will increase your safety if something were to happen.

==Travel Alone==
Traveling on your own can be an extremely empowering experience. Again, Sophie Geist had some interesting insights into the benefits of independent travel.  “people feel terrified of being alone in a a foreign country where you are constantly second guessing yourself and your choices. It is very nice to have someone to bounce ideas off of. On your own you learn to trust your instincts and you find that you are capable of making good, safe decisions. All the decisions are based on how you feel, you get to do and go where you want and you have to make it happen. Traveling alone gives you freedom from the security of someone from your culture; it pushes you to be more engaged in the culture you are visiting.”

When you start by traveling on your own you often don’t end up that way. The desire to not be alone often pulls travelers together. Sophie did not end up traveling on her own nearly as much as she thought she would. She said &quot;I always met people on the bus. Its random but you meet them and share your life story and become great friends. Its a beautiful thing&quot;. In her experience travelers often help other travelers.

A student who went to Kenya and took part in the buddy system explains, &quot;It was always nice to know someone was watching my back and making sure I was present and comfortable during the trip. I would always make sure she was present, okay, safe, and happy while she would do the same for me. Though it is sometimes okay to be out on your own, you always need to be aware of your circumstances, the people around you, and your surroundings as a whole. Even if a situation may seem safe, be sure to examine it from all angles and question your surroundings. Watch out for your fellow travelers and always keep your eyes open.&quot; During adventurous trips or excursions, there is improved safety when people take part in the buddy system. Both of them can prevent the other from getting hurt and rescue them in a crisis. It is important to introduce the buddy system to a group of travelers before the trip.

==Staying Safe==

The first step to staying safe in different countries is becoming familiar with the foreign area and customs. Become aware with the similarities and differences of what is and is not tolerated between your mother country and the foreign country. It is important not to travel alone, especially in high risk areas. Keep a low profile and try not to stand out as a foreigner or a tourist. Aim to blend in. Observe the local standards of dress and try to speak the native language of the community members. Pay attention to your surroundings while you are in your host country.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Passport==
A passport provides a lawfully legitimate identity that gives a person the ability to travel across a county’s borders. When traveling to another country, a passport is used in order to prove that an individual is actually a citizen of the country he or she claims to be from. Once the proper officials accept a passport, the traveler is granted entry into the country. Every country has different requirements for obtaining a passport. However, most countries require an original birth certificate and a fee. It is also recommended that the traveler obtain travelers insurance to protect the passport in case it gets lost or stolen. For more information on how to obtain a United States passport visit: http://travel.state.gov/passport/passport_1738.html.

==Visa==
Similar to passports, visas are a document that gives a person the ability to travel across a country’s borders. The difference between passports and visas is that visas specify certain reasons as to why an individual will be traveling as well as providing a timeframe for his or her stay. Most students who study abroad need to obtain a visa in order to designate the amount of time he or she will be staying in a country. A visa is a supplemental document that is usually attached to the passport. When planning to travel abroad, a visa issued by the country’s embassy may need to be obtained. It is also recommended that the travel obtain an insurance policy that covers the visa. For more information on how to obtain a visa, visit: http://www.travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_4965.html.

==Immunizations==

When you are traveling to other countries you often face health issues they wouldn't ordinarily experience at home. To lower your risks of becoming seriously ill when traveling abroad, you should find out in advance whether any specific immunizations may be recommended for travel to the region of the world you'll be visiting. It's also a good time to review your own immunization history. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), it's best to schedule a visit to your doctor or travel medicine clinic four to six weeks before an international trip. Since your body needs time to build up immunity after receiving a vaccine and many vaccines are given in a series over time, getting an early start on your immunizations is the best way to protect yourself. 

The CDC divides travel vaccinations into three categories: routine, recommended, and required. &quot;Routine&quot; vaccinations are those that are normally administered, usually during childhood(i.e mumps, measles, hepatitis. &quot;Recommended&quot; vaccinations are given to protect travelers from illnesses that occur routinely in other parts of the world (i.e Rabies,Typhoid fever). The only vaccine classified as &quot;required&quot; by International Health Regulations is the yellow fever vaccination for travel to certain countries in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical South America. Doctors determine which vaccines are recommended for international travel on an individual basis, taking into consideration your destination, whether you will be spending time in rural areas, the season of the year you are traveling, your age, your overall health status, and your immunization history.

Here is the link for the CDC website, which provides all the information you will need. http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/

==Packing-what to bring; how much to bring==

'''General Packing Tips'''

- Clearly identify your luggage inside and out with your name and US &amp; overseas address. Colored tape can make it easy to identify among similar baggage.
- Place a strap or piece of rope around your suitcase to secure it in case the lock breaks.
- Check airline regulations for weight, size and number of bags
- In your carry-on, keep a change of clothes, toiletries, valuables, important documents (passports, visas, arrival instructions) and medications in their original containers
-Pack as light and efficiently as possible

 '''Miscellaneous Items'''

- $100 in local currency for when you first arrive
- Map of your host city
- Guidebook of your region and of the places where you will travel
- Photocopy of your passport information pages.  Also leave a copy at home.
-  International calling card and access numbers for the countries where you will travel.
- Phone numbers to cancel credit cards in case of theft (800 numbers don't work outside US)
-Travel size board games, book, or cards, as you will not likely have a TV
- Portable audio devices: Music player, walkman or shock absorbent CD player, portable speakers, power supply, ipod
- Camera
-  Journal
-Addresses and photos of family and friends
-Travel alarm clock
-Umbrella or really good rain jacket that can be packed accessibly 
-Sunglasses
-Small sewing kit
-Money belt
-Day pack (for short trips; this could double as your carry-on)
-If you plan to travel, Swiss army knife with bottle opener, corkscrew, &amp; can opener, absorbent fast-drying and small-to-pack towel (available at outdoors stores like Erehwon, Fontana and REI)
- If you bring a laptop, inquire about international voltage converters at an electronics store
-Power strip so you only have to purchase one converter (if you plan to bring several items that require plug-in to an electrical outlet)

 '''Clothing'''

- Consider both the physical &amp; social climate; dress accordingly.  Persons in other countries tend to dress a bit more formally than we do in the US.
- Dark colors do not show dirt as readily
- Take durable, drip-dry, no-iron clothes
- Take items that have multiple uses and (for colder climates) can be layered.
- Comfort, respectful (modest), and practicality are the keys for both clothing and shoes
- Bring one professional outfit in case of a site visit to somewhere a little more formal
- Bring comfortable walking shoes. 

 '''Toiletries'''

-Don't overstock on toiletries; most things are available in major cities abroad.  Women may want to bring a preferred brand of tampons or pads, as they may not be as readily available abroad.
-Transfer liquids from breakable containers into plastic containers; use tape to seal the lids when traveling or pack them in ziplock bags to separate them from clothing
- Prescription drugs for the duration of your time abroad (in your carry-on)

'''What is TOO much (What NOT to bring unless required)'''

Too much – I know the list above looks large but you can really get it down to very little if you pack carefully. In this case packing light is especially important because you will literally be carrying everything around on your back for your entire trip! Keep this in mind when you are packing and keep it as light as possible!

Dressy clothes – unless you know you have to go to a black-tie event somewhere, jeans and a shirt are probably about as fancy as you are going to get when you are “roughing it” in hostels and inexpensive bars/restaurants. 

Hair dryers, flat irons, or tons of makeup – get into the travel spirit and leave the primping behind for a few days! You’ll be glad to have less of a load to carry and besides, you’d probably find it difficult to primp very well when you’re on the road and staying in hostels anyway.

Your laptop – it’s heavy; you won’t want to risk it getting stolen; and most hostels offer computers with internet to use for free anyway (this is subject to change depending on what kind of program your doing and where you're traveling)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Technology and Communication==
[[File:Internet map 1024.jpg|thumb|visual representation of the connectivity of a small portion of the internet]]
The flourishing of technology, particularly the internet, has facilitated new modes of communication that would have been unimaginable a couple of decades ago. However, access to technology is reflective of wealth and, like wealth, is distributed extremely unequally across the globe. It is important to research access to internet, telephones, and cell reception for the sake of maintaining contact with family and friends back home, as well as understanding the technological and economic circumstances of the area being visited. Furthermore, within one country or region there can be a vast range of access to such services; urban areas are more likely than rural ones to have access, for example. In this respect it is essential to plan ahead – know where you are going and what you will need. For example, if you will need a phone card or stamps, buy them in advance. For those who use technology frequently international travel, study, and/or service learning is likely to challenge reliance on electronic devices. Often we use technology to think or work for us- eliminating that opens us up to new possibilities for experiencing life in a rich and rewarding way. Welcome this challenge and embrace the opportunity to learn a new way of doing things.

== Media and Local News ==
One way to learn more about a country before even visiting there is by keeping up with news, both local and international. Events can change a country in an instance and it is imperative that you keep up with the local news. For example, a sudden event could change currency rates, safety, politics, or even the feasibility of traveling to that country. Also, it is important when keeping up with the news that you read a variety of sources, and consider where the news is coming from and possible motives for publishing such a story. For example, a science newspaper is going to have different motives and highlight different stories than a human rights website would. It is also a good idea to compare local news written within that country and international news. How that country is portrayed abroad will give you a great insight to how the world sees that country. However, local news will portray issues that are important directly to the citizens of that country. Comparing the two will give you a wide range of perspectives. \

In addition to watching your sources, reading the news is a great way to get a taste of the country before you visit. There are many different sources that can be found by searching online. There are also a variety of videos and online radios that will add some variety to your sources. If you are having trouble finding a source, asking your librarian or professor to help you out is always a good idea and could open your eyes to opportunities and information you might not otherwise known about. Listening to speakers or reading books from that country and its people could also give you valuable perspective into a foreign culture. Be creative and look up things you are interested in learning more about.

== Money ==
When traveling, you have many options in terms of how you want to deal with money. While you may find you have a preferred method to handle money while abroad, it is recommended that you utilize multiple methods, just in case a problem arises. Here are some options while you travel:

==== Cash ====
Cash is very convenient to use. It is important to have cash exchanged into the local currency in order to have the proper exchange rate applied to your purchases. Cash also poses a security risk too. Cash can be bulky to carry, and if stolen, there is no way to recover from that.

A tip from a traveler that wish he'd known earlier: carry small bills. After exchanging for the local currency, I found it helpful to carry small bills, especially when at markets. In many places, I found it commonplace to pay for items using exact bills or exact change, because of the regularity of haggling opportunities. At open-air markets, most items do not have a set price. I made a mistake when we visited a bustling weekly market in Kochia. As I passed a stand with basic writing supplies, I realized I was in need of pens. Having only a 500 shilling bill, and lifting it out of my wallet, I asked how much 3 pens would be. &quot;500&quot; the man replied, conveniently. I quickly traded the bill for the 3 pens, only to realize later that was not such a great idea. Other times I had only 1000 shilling bills, I wish I'd have smaller bills for haggling purposes. As Americans, accustomed to set prices for everything, it adds a new element to be able to haggle.

==== Debit/Credit Cards ====
Debit and Credit cards are extremely easy to use while traveling abroad because they can do the currency exchange automatically. They are also much more secure than cash, and can be shut down if stolen. The downside to cards is that if you are in a rural enough area, you may not be able to use your card. In this case, it is important to find an ATM before you arrive in the rural area, and pull out enough cash in advance.

==== Travelers Checks ====
Travelers checks are very secure. If they are stolen it is easy to get them replaced, and you can also have them issued in foreign currency. The downside to travelers checks, however, is many places will not accept them, or will charge fees to accept them. Because of this, they can become a hassle and become more expensive than they should be.

&lt;br /&gt;Although you may be traveling to various destinations in your study abroad programs, there are different matters that are important to be aware of in preparation for your departure.  If you plan to travel internationally your passport, visa, and immunizations are perhaps the most important pre-departure aspect to take care of. To be safe it may be wise to have your passport in your possession at least two weeks in advance.  If you have previously obtained your passport make sure that it will not expire within six months of your departure date.  

&lt;br /&gt;You may want to brush up current events, local customs, and sources of communication before you arrive at your destination. It may be necessary to be aware of the current political situation, know the areas that are more dangerous to travel in and be prepared.  Often times people are sure that they will be able to use a cellphone or a computer to communicate with home, but it might be a good idea to have back up plans. Being aware of where the embassy for your own country is located in the counties you will be visiting in case of an emergency is important. Before you depart to another country it is advised and will benefit you if you alert your country’s embassy. 

&lt;br /&gt;Health is a primary concern when traveling anywhere. Be aware of your personal well-being, consult your health insurance about leaving the country, and be aware of your destinations health care services. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is an excellent source for your use for any country you might be traveling.  Following the link http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/ to their site, which will allow you to see the vaccinations you will need, health precautions to take, and different diseases on high alert in your area of travel.

&lt;br /&gt;There is a vast array of living situations in which any traveler may find themselves, but for any that you may come across there are things to consider such as the water sources, access to electricity, privacy, sanitation, etc. Often when you are traveling you may be staying with a family or a host and it is important to respect them and tell them all their food is good even if it’s not what you’re used to.

&lt;br /&gt;Using sources like: http://www.greenpassport.us/ and http://www.travelchannel.com/Places_Trips?intcmp=hp_nav_places-trips may be helpful tools in being prepared for your upcoming international travel.

Building Relationships Abroad
&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Friendship 2.jpg|thumb|Friendship 2]]
&lt;br /&gt;[[File:Dakar 2006 african women.jpg|thumb|Dakar 2006 african women]]
&lt;br /&gt;“I sit on a man’s back; choking him and making him carry me, and yet assure myself and others that I am very sorry for him and wish to ease his lot by any means possible, except getting off his back.” (Tolstoy)

&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Fixing and helping create a distance between people, but we cannot serve at a distance. We can only serve that to which we are profoundly connected.&quot;

&lt;br /&gt;It is clear that your interest in travel is sparked part by your curiosity and desire to experience people and places that are different. Take a minute to think about what kind of relationships you as a student might want to build with partners abroad. How can you make an impact on the places you are going and what is considered actually making an impact? How do you see yourself greeting people you have never met, who may speak a different language and may have completely different customs then you? How do you serve ethically, and build strong relationships? Think about the impact you leave when traveling to another place.

&lt;br /&gt;Within the last couple years, I have gone through two volunteer programs and traveled to many foreign countries on my own. I have seen many tourists repeat many mistakes, and realize I have made many of those mistakes myself. It is easy to go in with a mindset that you will make a positive impact, but sometimes it ends up being a waste of time for the community you are visiting, or can cause more damage then good. For example, a friend of mine traveled to India through a volunteer program she new little about. Not only did she lack knowledge in the program she was going through, she new very little about India as a whole. She came back with little to no knowledge about developing India, and built very few relationships with the local people. She had gone to see things, to be a tourist, and attempt to “give.” She tried to build relationships even though she did not know the best ways to go about it. After returning I asked her what she learned. Her response being, “I saw a lot of things that impacted me, but I did not really learn much.” How could she have made more of an impact, build relationships with those abroad, and serve ethically?

&lt;br /&gt;What comes into your mind when you think about serving ethically? Do you see a difference between serving, helping, or fixing a community, and which would you prefer doing? These are all different ways of looking at life. According to Rachel Naomi Remen, Author of &lt;u&gt;Helping, Serving or Fixing?&lt;/u&gt; (See article attached), “When you help, you see life as weak. When you fix, you see life as broken. When you serve, you see life as whole. Fixing and helping may be the work of the ego, and service the work of the soul.” She continues her article by emphasizing that service lays on the foundation that life is sacred and has an unidentified purpose. Now think again about what comes into your mind when you think about serving, helping, or fixing. If you have re-defined your meaning of each based on Remen’s definitions, then you will agree that when you serve, you know that you belong to a life and to the purpose of that life. We are all connected. As Remen put it, “All suffering is like my suffering and all joy is like my joy. The impulse to serve emerges naturally and inevitably from this way of seeing.”

&lt;br /&gt;Instead of going through a travel abroad program with the mindset of building a community or building a house, re-evaluate your intentions and focus your energy into building relationships. Do not see others as weaker, needier, or less equal then you. Realize that you could potentially damage there confidence, self esteem, sense of worth, and take away more than you can give. Let the relationships you build with those abroad strengthen you. Open your arms to others and let your service teach and strengthen you as well as those around you and those you are visiting. Feel renewed by your service because, “In serving, we find a sense of gratitude” (Remen). 

&lt;br /&gt;Objectives of Building Relationships Abroad:
&lt;br /&gt;To enhance the educational experience of student
&lt;br /&gt;To strengthen the networking between students and Universities
&lt;br /&gt;Broaden personal and educational perspectives
&lt;br /&gt;Explore, appreciate and understand different cultures
&lt;br /&gt;To enhance the ability of the student in second language learning
&lt;br /&gt;To eliminate fear and prejudice among nations
&lt;br /&gt;Enable student to experience international education
&lt;br /&gt;To immerse a student into a culture

&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it can be difficult to view the world outside of your own perceptions and realize that not everything may be as you assume.  Before traveling anywhere it is imperative that you open your mind to different ideas, different ways of life, and be willing to view other people’s lives as normal. That does not mean that you have to accept other cultures ways of life as normal for you, but learning to appreciate the differences that other people encompass will be a step towards understanding global citizenship.

&lt;br /&gt;With an open mind you may find it easier to become an ethical global citizen.  The compilation of terms, ethical global citizen may seem overwhelming or possibly self-explanatory. The true definition may be a good discussion, but a broad, basic definition may be: demanding basic principles to be a starting point for accepting universal values and maintaining personal responsibility for all global citizens whether they are humans, plants, animals, etc.  

&lt;br /&gt;Participating in service learning can be a positive way to establish your own views on becoming an ethical global citizen. Service learning programs aim to promote participation in organized, experimental, hands-on learning allowing education to occur through experience.

&lt;br /&gt;It feels unnatural to liberate ourselves from our biases and preconceived notions.  Before traveling, an individual should be aware of their own customs, and acknowledge that they are representative of their program, school, organization, and country.  It can seem subjective and overwhelming to consider the broader implications that a single trip can have, but some ideas can be illustrated through the following stories.  I would urge those preparing to travel to hold onto these stories, and other experiences they have had abroad, to challenge oneself to consider all aspects of ethical global citizenship.

&lt;br /&gt;'''Giving''': Though innocently well-intentioned, the concept of “giving” entails dynamics that must be considered thoroughly, and which depend on context.  There are elements of favoritism and disparity that can arise when meaning to be philanthropic.   Daniela Papi, in her “voluntourism” article, describes a sort of “feed the communities” option for visiting tourists.  She describes the $45 “giving” excursion as more of a “feed the animals at the zoo” rather than a worthwhile service modality.  She also explains that these volunteers often make a hundred times a typical local salary, and take unskilled labor positions from the population.

&lt;br /&gt;'''Hard Work''':  For Westerners, it is common to want to go into a service project with a fixed agenda.  A story from a service learning student described a house-building project that took place in Guatemala.  The student described passing up the opportunity to sit and drink coffee with the locals, while being busy with a rigid house-building schedule.  Only later did he come to realize that the by being so project-oriented, he overlooked what the locals really valued; the gesture of sitting down and appreciating their work.

&lt;br /&gt;'''Assumptions''':  Some stories demonstrate the assumptions that foreigners have about us.  The first comes from a friend’s trip to Ghana.  After learning that my friend was from Seattle, a local asked, “can you get me a job with Bill Gates?”  Caught off-guard, my friend at first took the comment as a joke.  The local assumed that if this traveler was wealthy enough to travel to Africa, and from Seattle, he surely must know Bill Gates.  A similar story from another friend was in her trip to India.  Traveling alone as a white American girl, she endured comments and unnecessary attention from men who are accustomed to more conservative dress.  They assumed that because she wore jeans and a T-shirt instead of a burqa, that she must be inviting attention.

&lt;br /&gt;'''Privilege''': As travelers, we must recognize our own privilege, and handle with care the relationships we develop, as to dismantle any disparity.  We must be mindful not to make iPods and cars the main topic of conversation, so that we do not come off as flaunting our wealth.  Even a camera, in its one-directional nature, can display a sort of disparity, as the photographer has the privilege to point one-way.  Respect can be built by asking permission when taking pictures, being in the picture with the person, or having the local take their own pictures.

&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly, a single trip has repercussions far beyond that trip.  Traveling should be about building long-term, sustainable partnerships.  Alanna Shaikh, of ''Blood and Milk'', and ''Global Health'' websites, recommends spending at least two months learning about the country, and the systems in place, before attempting to run a project.  Mark Overmann, in “Dispelling the Rosy View,” describes a long learning curve before getting a sense of a foreign country, and explains that short term volunteers do not play a significant role in a long-term partnerships.
