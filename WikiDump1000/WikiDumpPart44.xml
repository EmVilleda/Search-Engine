Newport Beach, CA - Kurt Kawohl, author of a newly released book &quot;Transcendentalism - A New Revelation&quot; has reinstituted Transcendentalism in the USA. Kurt was born in Germany in 1941 and now lives in California where he is an Author/ Financial Advisor/ Real Estate Broker. It is his belief that the American Transcendental movement would have survived and thrived today if their philosophy had been more compatible with the majority American religious beliefs of spiritual inspirations and revelations together with insight as being acceptable communicators of the truth. 

In his book Kurt explores the origin of religious beliefs and religions. Although he credits most past religious leaders, writers and portrayed prophets of the “Holy Books” with having experienced spiritual interaction with a spiritual existence, Kurt attributes their mind’s interpretation of these events as being blended with superstitions which was the norm of that time period. It is the author’s claim that his  concept of a spiritual deity is also derived through his own spiritual experiences and that the spiritual existence in the spiritual realm is in actuality a spiritual collective; the progressive and accumulative spiritual intelligence of the universe; an agglomeration of all of the righteous souls who have passed into the spiritual realm.

Kurt states in his book, “Transcendentalism Today&quot; can influence the beginning of a new integration of rationality  into many religions. In this 21st Century, the Age of Technology, we are still plagued by religious beliefs that is a contributing cause toward terrorism, killings and wars between nations. Belief in a deity who caused catastrophes, punished people and created the universe out of nothingness as if by magic was brought about by hysteria and superstitions. This thought process needs to be reassessed and brought up to date. Open-minded people must use common sense to determine whether this so-called deity was incorrectly perceived, misinterpreted and misunderstood by the masses of a bygone era. When peoples' concepts are flawed, corrections, truth, logic and common sense thereof must eventually prevail.  It is the attributes of human characteristics to exercise upon others power, control, dominance, destruction, punishment, revenge, judgment and not the attributes of a deity. Everyone is personally responsible for his own soul's destiny, the only requirement for achieving spiritual continuity is righteous living. The destruction of civilizations, most sufferings and premature deaths are due to human frailties, stupidity or imperfections and are not a deity’s doings. The deity that mankind calls by several names exists in a spiritual realm and never has and never will interfere with anything on earth or in the universe.” 

Will the author’s concept of Transcendentalism Today survive? Only time will tell. Kurt has had dialogue with religious leaders worldwide and supplies the evidence thereof in his book. On a website catering primarily to active and retired military personnel, at Military.com Kurt has posted his Transcendentalism opinions on who/what “God” is and supplied the website where his book can be accessed free of charge. Surprisingly over 10,000 people have visited there within a one year time period with many expressing their approval.  

-----------
 
Lt. Colonel - US Air Force (retired) Melvin J. Beitscher wrote an email to Kurt stating, “As I near the end of your book and turn each page, I marvel at the insight, research and reading you have done to come to this point in your life and how you now affect so many more lives. Sometimes I lose a little hope for mankind but with you, and I know there are many like you, I realize that there is hope that we may transcend that which separates us. You have started that vital journey with a remarkable thesis in your book &quot;Transcendentalism - A New Revelation&quot;. Your courage to fly in the face of  organized religion and see the truth behind the basics of all religion deserves a Nobel Prize. The courage you display in listing the correspondence with other learned people even though it may be at odds with your statements is to be commended. Christopher Phillips writes &quot;It is not enough to have the courage of your convictions, you must also have the courage to have your convictions challenged&quot;. You have that courage and wisdom. Congratulations on a work long needed“.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Presidents of the United States==
Although Washington was a member of the Whig Party before the Revolution, after the war he was not a member of any party, though he tended to lean toward Federalist positions. Since the formation of the Democratic-Republican party and the Federalist Party, there has always been at least one viable political party. Today the United States has a two party system. There have been many third party movements, such as Ralph Nader, and Theodore Roosevelt, but these attempts to create a three-party system have, thus far, failed.

==History==

Roby Joehanes initiated this wikibook in 2003. However, unhappy with the collaboration in Wikibook, he resigned in late 2003. This wikibook is then developed by 

==Authors==

The [[Indonesian]] textbook was started by [[User:robbyjo|Roby Joehanes]]

Edit: If you look at Robby Jo's profile, it states that he has given up contributing to WikiBooks Indonesia. Although he will be sorely missed [from this place], his presence is much needed. Either we petition for him to come back, or we continue this great Wiki from where he left off ~Cheetincheetah

[[Indonesian/Lesson 0 Exercise|Go to Exercise: Rhyme Game]]

== The alphabet and its pronunciation ==
Indonesian letters are the same as those used in English.  Historically, the languages of Indonesia had been written in Indian alphabets or the Arabic alphabet. All of the letters ''A'' through ''Z''
are used, as in English, though some of the letters are pronounced differently. However, unlike English, Indonesian spelling is very consistent: letters are largely pronounced as they are spelled and no letters are silent. You will find that the sounds are similar to Spanish.

Below is a table of the Indonesian alphabet. The pronunciation column shows how each letter is pronounced in Indonesian. The sound column shows how it sounds in
English.  Where the sound isn't spelled out, it is roughly the same as in
English.

'''Listen''' to how Indonesians pronounce the alphabet: [[media:indonesian-alphabet-a-m.ogg|'''A-M''']]; [[media:indonesian-alphabet-n-z.ogg|'''N-Z''']]

{| class=wikitable align=&quot;top&quot;
|-
! ''Letter''
! ''Pronunciation''
! ''IPA''
! ''English Approximation''
|-
| a || a (like ''a'' in ''father'') || [a]
| always the ''a'' in ''father'', ''Dali Lama'' but shorter, never the &quot;a&quot; in ''catch''
|-
| b || be (like ''bay'') || [b]
| &amp;nbsp;
|-
| c || ce (pronounced &quot;chay&quot;) || [&amp;#680;] (versus English [&amp;#679;])
|
Almost always like the ''ch'' in ''church'', ''chest'', and in some borrowed words or proper nouns like the French ''c'est'' (nearly like English ''say'')
|-
| d || de (like ''da'' in ''day'') || [d]
| like ''de'' in ''deli''
|-
| e || e
| [&amp;#603;], [&amp;#601;], [e] (not [e&amp;#618;])
| there are three ways of pronouncing ''e'' in Indonesian:
# one (and by far the more common) is the schwa sound, as in ''e'' in ''stern'', ''learn''.
# second one is like the ''e'' in ''bed'', ''red''.
# and third is like in ''a'' in ''foray'' and ''came''
|-
| f || ef || [f]
| like the English standalone ''f'', though often substituted with ''p'' and vice versa
|-
| g || ge (&quot;GAY&quot;) || [&amp;#609;]
| always the hard ''g'' in English: ''gas'', ''guard'' except in conjunction with an ''n''
|-
| h || ha || [h]
| as in the English ''have'' except when occurring at the end of a word when it is pronounced but unvoiced
|-
| i || i (pronounced &quot;EE&quot;) || [i] || Like the long &quot;e&quot; sound in &quot;bee&quot;, &quot;see&quot;, but shorter
|-
| j || je (&quot;JAY&quot;) || [&amp;#677;] (versus English [&amp;#676;])
| like the ''j'' in ''joke'', some accents make it sound much heavier making ''dj'' a closer transliteration
|-
| k || ka || [k] (versus English [k&amp;#688;])
| like the ''k'' in ''kite'' except when at the end of the word when it functions more like a glottal stop
|-
| l || el || [l] || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| m || em || [m] || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| n || en || [n] || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| o || o
| [o] (not [o&amp;#650;] or British [&amp;#601;&amp;#650;]), [&amp;#596;]
| there are two ways of pronouncing ''o'' in Indonesian:
# like the [[media:indonesian-o1-sound.ogg|''o'']] in ''post'', ''rope'', but don't pronounce the ''u'' sound.
# more open, like the [[media:indonesian-o2-sound.ogg|''o'']] in ''boss'', ''stop''.
|-
| p || pe (&quot;PAY&quot;) || [p] (versus [p&amp;#688;]) || (Do not aspirate)
|-
| q || ki (&quot;KEE&quot;) || [k] || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| r || er (like English &quot;AIR&quot;) || [r]
| always trilled as in the ''r'' in Spanish.
|-
| s || es || [s] || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| t || te (&quot;TAY&quot;) || [t] (versus [t&amp;#688;])
| always the hard ''t'' in English: ''test'', ''top'' (Do not aspirate)
|-
| u || u (&quot;OO&quot;) || [u]
| like the ''oo'' in ''soon'', ''boot''
|-
| v || fe (&quot;FAY&quot;)|| [f] || pronounced like ''f''
|-
| w || we (&quot;WAY&quot;) || [w] || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| x || eks || [ks] || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| y || ye (&quot;YAY&quot;)|| [j] || &amp;nbsp;
|-
| z || zet || [z] || &amp;nbsp;
|}

&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Selamat jalan.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;font color=&quot;000000&quot;&gt;Terjemahannya (The Translation):

&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Good morning, Ma'am!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Good morning, Sir!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;How are you?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Good. You?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Also good.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;What are you doing?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;I am reading a novel.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;What novel are you reading?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;I am reading a novel all about Islam!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;May I borrow it?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Of course.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;I already have to go. Goodbye and don't forget I'll borrow your book tomorrow&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;ff0000&quot;&gt;Budi:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;Of course I won't forget, goodbye too.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;Wati:&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;Good bye.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Kata-Kata Baru ''(New Vocabulary)'' == 
* Selamat pagi - good morning
* Selamat tinggal - goodbye (when leaving)
* Bu - ma'am. Literally means ''mother''.
* Pak - sir. Literally means ''father''.
* Apa kabar - how are you? what's up?
* Baik - good, well
* Anda - you (
* Kamu - you (informal)
* Juga - also
* Dan - and
* Jika- if
* Apa - what

== Selamat ==

The word ''selamat'' means ''safe''. So, ''selamat pagi'' literally means ''safe morning''. The greetings in Indonesian is not quite the same as that of English. Below is the table of words with their meaning and
the time you may want to use it:


{| class=wikitable
|-
! ''Kata'' (Word)
! ''Arti'' (Meaning)
! ''Waktu / Kondisi''
(Time / Condition)
|-
| Pagi || morning
| Sun is already risen, but before 10am.
|-
| Siang || noon || Around noon. Usually 10am-2pm.
|-
| Sore || afternoon || Sun is still up, but after 2pm.
|-
| Malam || night || Sun must have set.
|-
| Tinggal || bye
| When parting, said to the person staying
|-
| Jalan || bye
| When parting, said to the person leaving
|}

Unlike English, it is all right to greet people with ''&quot;selamat malam&quot;'' when meeting at night. To say ''&quot;good bye&quot;'', we can use ''&quot;selamat tinggal&quot;''.

The word ''&quot;selamat&quot;'' also means ''congratulations''. Therefore, it
is also used to congratulate other people. So, you can use the word
''&quot;selamat&quot;'' with the following words:


{| class=wikitable
|-
! ''Kata'' (Word)
! ''Arti'' (Meaning)
|-
| Ulang tahun || Birthday (literally: ''ulang'' = repeat; ''tahun'' = year)
|-
| Tahun baru || New year (literally: ''baru'' = new)
|-
| Natal || Christmas
|-
| Paskah || Easter
|-
| Jalan || voyage (i.e. ''bon voyage'')
|}

So, ''&quot;selamat ulang tahun&quot;'' means ''happy birthday''. And so forth. Note that the word ''&quot;jalan&quot;'' means ''street'' or ''to go'', but when used in ''&quot;selamat jalan&quot;'', it means ''&quot;bon voyage&quot;''.

== Apa Kabar ''(How Are You?)'' ==

The phrase ''&quot;apa kabar&quot;'' literally means ''&quot;what (your) news&quot;''. The word ''&quot;apa&quot;'' means ''&quot;what&quot;'' and the word ''&quot;kabar&quot;'' means ''&quot;news&quot;''. When translated, it means ''&quot;how are you&quot;''.

To answer ''&quot;apa kabar&quot;'', we usually use ''&quot;baik&quot;'' or ''&quot;baik-baik&quot;'' to indicate that it's good. We can answer ''&quot;biasa saja&quot;'' (= &quot;so so&quot;) or
''&quot;kurang baik&quot;'' (= &quot;not good&quot;, literally = &quot;less good&quot;).

In Malay, they use the spelling of ''&quot;khabar&quot;'' instead of ''&quot;kabar&quot;'', and thus the pronunciation is slightly different.

== Sapaan ''(Salutations)'' ==

Notice that the dialog above uses ''&quot;pak&quot;'' and ''&quot;bu&quot;'', which mean ''&quot;sir&quot;'' and ''&quot;ma'am&quot;'' respectively. In Indonesian, you'll need to specify proper salutations in most cases when greeting people. This is because Indonesian people tend to be very polite. In formal situations or the work place, adults usually greet using ''&quot;pak&quot;'' or ''&quot;bu&quot;''.

The word ''Anda'' (usually capitalised to show respect) is the general, relatively polite form of ''you''; note that ''bapak'' and ''ibu'' could also be used, as well as casual forms such as ''kamu''.

The article ''&quot;pak&quot;'' is shorthand for ''&quot;bapak&quot;'' (= mister or father), while ''&quot;bu&quot;'' is an abbreviation of ''&quot;ibu&quot;'' (= madam or mother).

[[Indonesian| ^ Indonesian ^]] | [[Indonesian/Lesson 1| &lt;&lt; Lesson 1: Greetings]]  | Lesson 2: This, That |[[Indonesian/Lesson 3| Lesson 3: Pronouns &gt;&gt;]]
=== Arti Umum ''(General Meaning)'' ===

The word ''&quot;ini&quot;'' means ''&quot;this&quot;'' or ''&quot;these&quot;''.&lt;br&gt;
The word ''&quot;itu&quot;'' means ''&quot;that&quot;'' or ''&quot;those&quot;''.&lt;br&gt;

=== Penggunaan Pertama: Ini buku ''(First Usage: This [is a] book)'' ===

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Ini buku. ''(&quot;This is a book&quot; or &quot;These are books&quot;)''
* Ini pensil. ''(&quot;This is a pencil&quot; or &quot;These are pencils&quot;)''
* Itu apel. ''(&quot;That is an apple&quot; or &quot;Those are apples&quot;)''
* Itu jeruk. ''(&quot;That is an orange&quot; or &quot;Those are oranges&quot;)''

From the examples above, you can see that there is no explicit word for
''&quot;to be&quot;'' as in English. It is already implied by the structure or the
vocabulary used in the sentence.

In addition, when using a noun, the meaning can be either
singular or plural. It depends on the context. When the context does not
make it clear, the noun is assumed to be singular.

The reader might ask: If ''ini buku'' means this is a book while when naively translated sounds like &quot;This book.&quot; Then how to say &quot;this book&quot; in Indonesian? Answer: ''buku ini''. When learning Indonesian, or when Indonesian learning English, people usually realized that the order of words, especially adjective and noun, are usually swapped.

=== Penggunaan Kedua: Buku ini merah ''(Second Usage: This book [is] red)'' ===

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;merah&lt;/font&gt;. ''(&quot;This book is &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/font&gt;&quot; or &quot;These books are &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/font&gt;&quot;)''
* Apel ini &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;hijau&lt;/font&gt;. ''(&quot;This apple is &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/font&gt;&quot; or &quot;These apples are &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/font&gt;&quot;)''
* Pensil itu '''hitam'''. ''(&quot;That pencil is '''black'''&quot; or &quot;Those pencils are '''black'''&quot;)''
* Jeruk itu &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;jingga&lt;/font&gt;. ''(&quot;That orange is &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/font&gt;&quot; or &quot;Those oranges are &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/font&gt;&quot;)''

Notice the difference between the first pattern and the second one:
* The first pattern is ''''(Ini/Itu) + Noun'''', which means ''''This/That is/are Noun''''.
* The second pattern is ''''Noun + (Ini/Itu) + Adjective'''', which means ''''This/That Noun is/are Adjective''''

=== Bentuk Negatif ''(Negative Form)'' ===

There are two words in Indonesian used to indicate negatives:
* Bukan &amp;rarr; Not, referring to nouns, pronouns, or states (it may be easiest to remember the meaning of bukan as &quot;not a&quot;, since only nouns would follow &quot;a&quot; in English)
* Tidak &amp;rarr; Not, referring to adjectives or verbs

In some cases, we can use either ''bukan'' or ''tidak'', but we'll discuss this later.

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Ini bukan buku. ''(&quot;This is not a book&quot; or &quot;These are not books&quot;)''
* Ini bukan pensil. ''(&quot;This is not a pencil&quot; or &quot;These are not pencils&quot;)''
* Itu bukan apel. ''(&quot;That is not an apple&quot; or &quot;Those are not apples&quot;)''
* Itu bukan jeruk. ''(&quot;That is not an orange&quot; or &quot;Those are not oranges&quot;)''

Here, we use ''bukan'', because we're negating the nouns. However, look at the following example:

* Ini tidak benar. ''(&quot;This is not right&quot;)''

This time, we are negating the adjective &quot;right&quot;. (Benar = right / correct)

Likewise, look at the following examples:
Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Buku ini tidak &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;merah&lt;/font&gt;. ''(&quot;This book is not &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/font&gt;&quot; or &quot;These books are not &lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;red&lt;/font&gt;&quot;)''
* Apel ini tidak &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;hijau&lt;/font&gt;. ''(&quot;This apple is not &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/font&gt;&quot; or &quot;These apples are not &lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;green&lt;/font&gt;&quot;)''
* Pensil itu tidak hitam. ''(&quot;That pencil is not black&quot; or &quot;Those pencils not are black&quot;)''
* Jeruk itu tidak &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;jingga&lt;/font&gt;. ''(&quot;That orange is not &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/font&gt;&quot; or &quot;Those oranges are not &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/font&gt;&quot;)''

In these examples, we use ''tidak'' because this time we're negating the adjectives.

=== Bentuk Interogatif ''(Interrogative Form)'' ===

The word ''&quot;apa&quot;'' (= ''&quot;what&quot;'') can be used to form questions using ''&quot;ini&quot;'' or ''&quot;itu&quot;''.

* Apa ini?  ''(&quot;What is/are this/these?&quot;)''
* Apa itu?  ''(&quot;What is/are that/those?&quot;)''

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Q: Apa ini?
* A: Ini buku.

You can use ''&quot;apa ini&quot;'' or ''&quot;apa itu&quot;'' to ask what something is called in Indonesian (by pointing to the object).

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Indonesian Grammar Header}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

[[Indonesian| ^ Indonesian ^]] | [[Indonesian/Lesson 2| &lt;&lt; Lesson 2: This, That]]  | Lesson 3: Pronouns |[[Indonesian/Lesson 4| Lesson 4: Simple Sentences &gt;&gt;]]
== General Pronoun ==

In Indonesian, both subjective and objective pronouns are the same. Possessive
pronouns are slightly different in informal situations only. Below is the table:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
! English
! Formal
! Informal
! Informal Possesive
|-
| I ||  Saya    ||  Aku   ||  -ku
|-
| You ||  Anda    ||  Kamu  ||  -mu
|-
| He/She/It ||  Beliau  ||  Dia   ||  -nya
|-
| We (inclusive) ||  Kita    ||  Kita 
| Kita
|-
| We (exclusive) ||  Kami    ||  Kami 
| Kami
|-
| You (Plural) ||  Kalian  ||  Kalian ||  Kalian
|-
| They ||  Mereka  ||  Mereka ||  Mereka
|}

Note that there are two notions of ''&quot;we&quot;'' in Indonesian. If the opposite party is included, then we use ''&quot;kita&quot;''. Otherwise, we use ''&quot;kami&quot;''.

Contoh ''(Example)'':

* Budi: &quot;Wati, ini buku kita.&quot; ''(= Wati, this is our book.)''

Here, Budi speaks to Wati that this book is both Budi's and Wati's book. However, if Budi said, ''&quot;Wati, ini buku kami.&quot;''; it means that this book is Budi's (and probably his other friend's), but not Wati's.

To refer a third person that has already died, He/She/It, when person we are speaking about already passed away and we want to refer to those people with respect, we use another word ''almarhum'' meaning &quot;he&quot; when the he is already died and &quot;he&quot; happens to be a respectable person. For female we use the word ''almarhumah''. This is a rare instance when Bahasa Indonesia is gender specific. This is a loan word from Arabic which literally means: &quot;who was blessed by God.&quot; In this sense, this is actually a euphemism. So we can conclude that words 'almarhum' and 'almarhumah' are purposed to Muslims. The non-Muslim people usually change it with ''''mendiang'''', which is simpler and can be used by both genders.

== Kata Kepunyaan ''(Possessive Pronoun)'' ==

As you probably have noted in the previous example, the position of possessive
pronoun is reversed in Indonesian.

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Buku kami. ''(= our book(s))''
* Apel mereka. ''(= their apple(s))''
* Jerukku. ''(= my orange(s))''
* Gelasnya. ''(= his/her/its glass(es))''
* Bolpoinmu. ''(= your pen(s))''
* Coklat saya. ''(= my chocolate(s))''
* Mobil beliau. ''(= his/her/its car)''

In these examples, notice that when using informal possessive of singular person, the suffix is put together with the noun.

Although in spoken Indonesian it is acceptable to say ''&quot;gelas dia&quot;'' instead of ''&quot;gelasnya&quot;'' and ''&quot;bolpen kamu&quot;'' instead of ''&quot;bolpenmu&quot;'', it is incorrect to say ''&quot;jeruk aku&quot;'' to mean ''&quot;my orange&quot;''.

== Kata Kepunyaan #2 ''(Possessive Pronoun Part 2)'' ==

In most languages there is the possibility of both adjective-like posessives &quot;this is &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;my&lt;/font&gt; book&quot; and noun like adjectives &quot;this book is &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;mine&lt;/font&gt;&quot; or &quot;this is &lt;font color=&quot;CC0000&quot;&gt;mine&lt;/font&gt;.&quot; Indonesian doesn't do this exactly like this but does have an equivalent:

# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;ku.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This book is mine)''
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;mu.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This book is yours)''
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;nya.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This book is his/hers/its)''
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt; aku.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This book is mine)''
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt; kami.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This book is ours)'' (exclusive)
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt; kita.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This book is ours)'' (inclusive)
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt; mereka.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This book is theirs)''
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt; Budi.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This book is Budi's)''
# Ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;ku.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt; ''(This is mine)''

Notice that this kind of structure is &quot;bridged&quot; by the word ''&quot;&lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;/font&gt;&quot;'', which means &quot;to have&quot;. You can then put the appropriate suffix or word to indicate the ownership.

A synonym of ''&quot;&lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;/font&gt;&quot;'' is ''&quot;&lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;milik&lt;/font&gt;&quot;''. Hence you can change &quot;&lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;punya&lt;/font&gt;&quot; with &quot;&lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;milik&lt;/font&gt;&quot;.

&lt;i&gt;Example:&lt;/i&gt;

# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;milik&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;ku&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;milik&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;mu&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;
# Buku ini &lt;font color=&quot;006600&quot;&gt;milik&lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;nya&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;

== Contoh ''(Examples)'' ==

Below are some examples that summarise what we've learnt:

# Saya punya buku &lt;font color=&quot;dddd00&quot;&gt;kuning&lt;/font&gt;. ''(= I have a yellow book)''
# Buku saya &lt;font color=&quot;dddd00&quot;&gt;kuning&lt;/font&gt;. ''(= My book is yellow)''.
# Kamu punya bolpen &lt;font color=&quot;0000dd&quot;&gt;biru&lt;/font&gt;, bukan bolpen &lt;b&gt;hitam&lt;/b&gt;. ''(= You have a blue pen, not a black pen)''
# Dia tidak punya pensil &lt;font color=&quot;009900&quot;&gt;hijau&lt;/font&gt;. ''(= He/she/it doesn't have a green pencil)''
# Budi punya apel &lt;font color=&quot;cc0000&quot;&gt;merah&lt;/font&gt;. ''(= Budi has a red apple/red apples)''
# Apel &lt;font color=&quot;cc0000&quot;&gt;merah&lt;/font&gt; ini punya Budi. ''(= This red apple is Budi's)''

Note that at the third example we use ''&quot;bukan&quot;'' to deny the noun (i.e. the pen). At the fourth example, we use ''&quot;tidak&quot;'' to deny the ownership, which is considered as a verb (i.e. &quot;doesn't have&quot;). Note also how we can put names in ownership at example five and six with the word ''&quot;punya&quot;''.

Basic Indonesian word order is similar to English. Generally, sentences begin with a subject, followed by a verb (also called a predicate), and then an object.

It's good news that Indonesian verbs don't change depending on tense. Indicating the past
or future tense only requires inserting words that indicate the time, in a very regular system.

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Saya makan nasi ''(= I eat rice)''
* Saya telah makan nasi ''(= I ate or have eaten rice)''
* Saya sudah makan nasi ''(= I ate or have eaten rice)''
* Saya akan makan nasi ''(= I will eat rice)''
* Saya sedang makan nasi ''(= I am eating rice)''
* Saya makan nasi kemarin ''(= I ate rice yesterday)''
* Kemarin, saya makan nasi ''(= Yesterday, I ate rice)''

As you noticed in the examples above, the word ''&quot;telah&quot;'' or ''&quot;sudah&quot;''
indicate completed actions, the word ''&quot;akan&quot;'' indicate future actions, and
the word ''&quot;sedang&quot;'' indicate actions in progress. The main verb (i.e. ''&quot;makan&quot;'' = to eat) is left unchanged.

Side note: In English, both cooked and uncooked rice are referred as rice alone. In Indonesian, uncooked rice is called ''beras'' while cooked rice is called ''nasi''. 

Note also that Indonesian has no notions of imperfect tense. Instead, Indonesian uses duration words, such as ''&quot;selama&quot;'' (literally means ''during'' or ''as long as''):

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Saya sudah belajar Bahasa Indonesia selama dua tahun. ''(= I have studied Indonesian (language) for two years)''
* Selama ini, saya belajar dengan baik. ''(= Until now, I've studied well)''
* Selama dua tahun ini, saya belajar dengan baik. ''(= For the last two years, I've studied well)''
* Selama kamu di sini, saya tidak akan pergi. ''(=As long as you are here, I will not go))''

Don't worry about these &quot;tenses&quot; yet. We'll study it in greater detail later.

=== Adding Emphasis ===

The Indonesian language is very expressive. While basic Indonesian word order matches English, you can scramble up the sentence structure, and the sentence will still have the same underlying meaning. In this regard, Indonesian is somewhat like Latin or Japanese, but without the cases or the particles.
Usually, when a word other than the subject is put at the beginning of a sentence, it becomes the emphasis of the sentence. This is broadly used in spoken
Indonesian.

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Saya sedang makan nasi ''(= I am eating rice, neutral emphasis)''
* Sedang makan nasi saya ''(= emphasis on the progress of eating rice, &quot;I am eating my rice&quot;)''
* Makan nasi sedang saya lakukan ''(= emphasis on eating rice, &quot;Eating rice (is what) I am doing (now)&quot;)''
* Nasi sedang saya makan ''(= emphasis on rice, &quot;Rice (is what) I am eating (now)&quot;)''

Note also that this way of providing emphasis can occur with any &quot;tense&quot; using the same pattern.

Don't be intimidated by this variability in word order. You can always form simple sentences as: '''Subject + Verb + Object'''.

== Cara Pemakaian ''(Usage)'' ==

I plan to structure this book so that for each lesson you will have the corresponding exercise. So, if you have finished [[Indonesian/Lesson 1|lesson 1]], do the exercise 1 before proceeding to [[Indonesian/Lesson 2|lesson 2]], and so forth. This is so that you fully understand the Indonesian.

I understand that it is pretty hard to illustrate simple concepts of Indonesian without knowing anything about it. So, my approach is to illustrate the most important basic components of Indonesian in the basic section. My suggestion is to skim the basic section and grasp a little bit about it and step up to the beginner section so that you can see these components in action.

Contoh ''(Examples)'':
* 67  =  enam puluh tujuh 
* 111  =  seratus sebelas 
* 2743  =  dua ribu tujuh ratus empat puluh tiga 
* 8015  =  delapan ribu lima belas 
* 17432  =  tujuh belas ribu empat ratus tiga puluh dua 
* 408305  =  empat ratus delapan ribu tiga ratus lima
* 3178856  =  tiga juta seratus tujuh puluh delapan ribu delapan ratus lima puluh enam

== Urutan ''(Series)'' ==

* 1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; = pertama
* 2&lt;sup&gt;nd&lt;/sup&gt; = kedua (''or'' ke-2)
* 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; = ketiga (''or'' ke-3)
* 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; = keempat (''or'' ke-4)
* 5&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; = kelima (''or'' ke-5)
* 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; = kesepuluh (''or'' ke-10)
* 11&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; = kesebelas (''or'' ke-11)
* 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; = kedua puluh satu (''or'' ke-21)

As you see, in order to form ordinal numbers in series, you only need to attach the prefix &quot;ke-&quot;, then the number itself. Except for pertama (&quot;1st&quot;), you can spell out the number or just write the digits (like the ones in parentheses).

== Berapa ''(How much)'' ==

To ask about quantities, we use the word ''&quot;berapa&quot;''. For example:
''&quot;Berapa harga X&quot;'' is to ask ''&quot;How much does X cost''&quot;.

Contoh ''(Examples)'':
* Q: Berapa harga buku ini? ''(= How much does this book cost?)''
* A: Lima dolar. ''(= Five dollars)''
* A (alternate): Harga buku ini lima dolar. ''(= This book costs five dollars)''

The word ''&quot;berapa&quot;'' can directly replace the quantity in question. However, you must put a measure word right after it. 

Contoh ''(Examples)'':
* Q: Kamu punya berapa buah pensil? ''(= How many pencils do you have?)''
* A: Empat. ''(= Four)''
* A (alternate): Saya punya empat buah pensil. ''(= I have four pieces of pencil.)''

The most common measure word is ''&quot;buah&quot;'', which indicates quantity. Coincidentally, this word can also mean ''fruit'' (i.e. apples, oranges, etc). Other common measure words are ''&quot;ekor&quot;'' (for animals; ekor = tail) and ''&quot;orang&quot;'' (for people, orang = person).

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;Interestingly, the word ''biji'' (lit= fruit) is also sometime use to replace ''buah''.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The examples below illustrate using measure words:

Contoh ''(Examples)'':
* Q: Berapa buah pensil kamu punya? ''(= How many pencils do you have?)''
* A: Empat. ''(= Four)''

* Q: Berapa buah apel kamu punya? ''(= How many apples do you have?)''
* A: Tiga. ''(= Three)''

== Contoh Lain ''(Other Examples)'' ==

* Saya punya dua buah buku. ''(= I have two books)''
* Saya punya dua buah buku merah. ''(= I have two red books)''
* Saya tidak punya dua buah buku merah. ''(= I don't have two red books)''

== Angka Lebih Dari 999 ''(Numbers higher than 999)'' ==

In English, to make the number readable, we used to add a comma every three digits. For example, One million and two hundred and fifty-five thousands and three hundred and sixty-four can be written as 1,255,364. However in Indonesian, we insert a dot instead of comma. Hence the same number (Indonesia: ''Satu juta dua ratus lima puluh lima ribu tiga ratus enam puluh empat'') should be written as 1.255.364 . 

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
For curious reader, Indonesians use comma (&quot;,&quot;) to indicate decimals.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Kata Pembilang - ''Quantification Words'' ==

Indonesian language has no distinction between uncountable and countable nouns. If you want to say that there are more than one of a thing, as a rule of thumb you can repeat the noun using a dash (-) to make it plural. Alternatively you can also put the total number of the thing in front of the noun. 

There is no rule in Indonesian language regarding which nouns should/can be repeated, which nouns should not/cannot, but if we already put some quantification words, we can't do the repetition noun. For example: It is wrong to say '''banyak buku-buku''' - ''lots of books'', instead use either the phrase '''banyak buku''' or '''buku-buku'''

These words are essential to specify indefinite plurals:

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 1px #ffd6d6; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
* Banyak = many / a lot
* Beberapa = some / several
* Sedikit = a little / a few
* Para = some (for a specific group of people)
|}

== Kata Penunjuk Jumlah - Measure Words ==

An example of a measure words is the word &quot;pieces&quot; in &quot;two pieces of paper&quot;. You have seen the word '''buah''' in [[Indonesian/Lessons/Numbers|lesson 5]] to indicate the total of a quantity. The word '''buah''' can be considered as the &quot;universal&quot; measure word because it can fit in so many situations. However, you may want to fine tune it to convey a more precise meaning. For example: in the English language it's more proper to say &quot;two rolls of bread&quot; rather than &quot;two pieces of bread&quot;. This is because the measure word &quot;roll&quot; is more fitting than the word &quot;piece&quot; in this situation. The same thing applies to the Indonesian language.

Below are other common measure words, followed by the noun it measures.

{| WIDTH=&quot;75%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFF7F7; border: solid 1px #ffd6d6; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; | 
* Buah &amp;rarr; non-living thing
* Kuntum &amp;rarr; flowers
* Tangkai &amp;rarr; flowers, leaves
* Carik &amp;rarr; papers
* Lembar &amp;rarr; papers
* Jilid &amp;rarr; books
* Potong &amp;rarr; cakes, loaves
* Pucuk &amp;rarr; guns
* Ekor &amp;rarr; animals
* Orang &amp;rarr; people
* Helai &amp;rarr; long, thin and usually flat things
* Biji &amp;rarr; small round things
* Batang &amp;rarr; long, stick-like things

      <comment>/* Di (In/on/at [place]) */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Indonesian Grammar Header}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

[[Indonesian| ^ Indonesian ^]] | [[Indonesian/Lessons/Numbers| &lt;&lt; Lesson 5: Numbers]]  | Lesson 6: Particles |[[Indonesian/Lesson 7| Lesson 7: Introducing Yourself &gt;&gt;]]
== Di ''(In/on/at [place])'' ==

To indicate a place, we use the particle ''di''. It can mean ''in'', ''on'', or ''at''.

Contoh ''(Examples)'':
* Buku saya ada di meja. ''(My book is (in/on/at) [the] table)''
* Mobilmu ada di garasi. ''(Your car is (in/on/at) [the] garage)''

Note the word ''&quot;ada&quot;'', which means ''&quot;to exist&quot;''. It is placed right before the ''di'' particle to indicate existence.

Note also that the particle ''di'' doesn't convey any further detail on how the object is being placed, whether it's in front, inside, etc. To put additional detail, we put a location word after the particle ''di''.

Contoh ''(Examples)'':
* Buku saya ada di atas meja. ''(My book is on [the] table)''
* Mobilmu ada di dalam garasi. ''(Your car is in [the] garage)''

The word ''&quot;atas&quot;'' means ''&quot;top&quot;'' or ''&quot;above&quot;'' and ''&quot;dalam&quot;'' means ''&quot;inside&quot;''. Below is the list of location words you may use:

* Atas = top/above
* Bawah = under/below
* Dalam = inside
* Luar = outside
* Depan = front
* Belakang = behind/back
* Sebelah/Samping = beside
* Sebelah kiri = left side
* Sebelah kanan = right side

In Indonesian, to change the position is quite easy. Like ''Buku saya ada di atas meja'', if you want to change it becomes ''beside'' or ''behind'', you just need to change them into ''Buku saya ada di sebelah/samping meja'' and ''Buku saya ada di belakang meja''. 

Be careful to differentiate between ''di'' as prefix (''awalan'') and ''di'' as showing the place (''kata depan''). Most Indonesian natives forget about this and mistakes are common. If the word ''di'' is followed by a verb, it is a prefix.

Example
* Ia di luar ( ''he is outside'')
* Ia dipukul ( ''he was beaten'' -- pukul = ''beat'')

Indonesian also commonly (and mistakenly) use ''di'' with time, for example ''&quot;di waktu sedih&quot;'' (during sad times). ''Pada'' is the correct proposition for time. Hence, it should be ''&quot;pada waktu sedih&quot;''.

== Pada ''(at [person])'' ==

Although in spoken Indonesian it is acceptable to use ''di'' to indicate the existence of a noun at someone, this is unusual. For example, it is not correct to say: ''&quot;Bukumu ada di Budi&quot;'' to mean &quot;Your book is at Budi&quot;. Rather, you should use the particle ''&quot;pada&quot;'':

&quot;Bukumu ada pada Budi&quot; ''(Your book is at Budi)

This sounds awkward to translate literally. Usually in English, people would say &quot;Budi has your book&quot;.

This preposition is also used for time, for example ''&quot;Pada pukul enam pagi.&quot;'' (At 6 am)

== Ke ''(to [a place])'' ==

The particle ''ke'' is to indicate the notion of ''to a place''. It is often coupled with the word ''&quot;pergi&quot;'', which means ''to go''.

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Ibu pergi ke pasar. ''(Mother goes to [the] market)''
* Ayah pergi ke kantor. ''(Father goes to [the] office)''
* Saya pergi ke sekolah. ''(I go to [the] school)''
* Dia pergi ke rumahmu. ''(He/she/it goes to your house)''

In spoken Indonesian, people often omit ''&quot;pergi&quot;'' when the context is clear. So, you'll often hear ''&quot;Ibu ke pasar&quot;'' to mean ''&quot;Mother [goes] to [the] market&quot;''.

== Kepada ''(to [a person])'' ==

Some verbs in English like &quot;to send&quot;, &quot;to give&quot; and so on need the particle &quot;to&quot;, followed by a person. For example: &quot;I give the book to you&quot;. In Indonesian, for this notion of &quot;to&quot;, you cannot use the particle ''ke''. Rather, you'll use the particle ''kepada''.

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Saya memberikan buku ini kepadamu. ''(= I give this book to you)''
* Dia mengirimkan surat ini kepada saya. ''(= He/she sends this letter to me)''

Memberikan = to give&lt;br&gt;
Mengirimkan = to send&lt;br&gt;
Surat = letter&lt;br&gt;

Certainly, in spoken Indonesian, people may violate this rule and use &quot;ke&quot; instead of the proper &quot;kepada&quot;.

== Dari ''(From)'' ==

The particle ''&quot;dari&quot;'' is almost synonymous with ''&quot;from&quot;'' in English. It is to indicate the origin of something.

Contoh ''(Example)'':
* Saya datang dari rumah. ''(I come from [the] house)''
* Dia datang dari Amerika. ''(He/she comes from [the] US)''

Not only that ''&quot;dari&quot;'' explains the place origin, but also explains the origin of things. For example:

* Cincin ini terbuat dari emas. ''(This ring is made of gold)''

Cincin = ring&lt;br&gt;
Terbuat = is made&lt;br&gt;
Emas = gold

== Untuk ''(For)'' ==

The particle ''&quot;untuk&quot;'' is almost synonymous with ''&quot;for&quot;''. For example:

* Buku ini untukmu. ''(This book is for you)''
* Pensil ini untuknya. ''(This pencil is for him/her/it)''

It is also used to explain the usage of a thing:

* Pensil ini untuk menulis. ''(This pencil is for writing [things])''

(menulis = write)

----

C should answer &quot;No&quot;.

== Reasoning ==

B is either a knave or a spy.  If B is a spy, then A is truthful and is therefore the knight.

  A - Knight
  B - Spy
  C - Knave

On the other hand, if B is the knave, there are two possibilities:

  A - Spy
  B - Knave
  C - Knight

or

  A - Knight
  B - Knave
  C - Spy

If C is either the knave or the knight, his answer to the question will be &quot;No&quot;, and so the judge will not be able to draw a conclusion.  On the other hand, C can answer &quot;Yes&quot; only if he is the spy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Human civilization in the Americas probably began in the last ice age, when prehistoric hunters crossed a land bridge between the Asian and North American continents. Civilizations in North America, Central America, and South America had different levels of complexity, technology, and cohesiveness.
  
Some of the most powerful and organized societies occurred in South and Central America.  These cultures developed writing, allowing them to spread and dominate. They created some of the largest cities in the Ancient world.

North American cultures were more fragmented and less unified. The tribe was often the major social unit, with exchanges between tribes creating similar societies over vast distances. Tribal dwellings as large as European towns flourished in the rugged desert of southwestern North America.

European-descended historians have difficulty referring to these cultures as a whole, as the native people did not have a unified name for themselves. At first, Europeans called natives &quot;Indians&quot;. This term came from the belief by Christopher Columbus that he had discovered a new passage to India. Despite Amerigo Vespucci ascertaining that the Americas were not actually India, Indian continued to be used as the 'de facto' name for native inhabitants until around 1960. Starting in the 1960s, the term &quot;Native American&quot; was used. Yet this term may be too vague: isn't anyone born in America a Native American? There is also &quot;American Indian&quot;. This is too general a term for a group having little in common other than skin tone and non-European language. In Canada, the term &quot;First People&quot; is used. All these terms for the native people of America show just how diverse Pre-Columbian America was and the disagreement continues between scholars today about this period.

==Early Inhabitants of the Americas==
American history does not begin with Columbus's 1492 arrival. The Americas were settled long before the first European arrived. Civilization began during the last ice age, some 15 to 40 thousand years ago. Huge ice sheets covered the north, so sea levels were much lower, creating a land bridge between Asia and North America. This was the Bering land bridge, a gap in two large ice sheets creating a connection from lands near present day Alaska, through Alberta, and into the continental United States.

[[Image:Beringia_-_late_wisconsin_glaciation.gif|right]]Nomadic Asians following herds of wild game traveled into the continental United States. A characteristic arrow point was found and first described near the present day town of Clovis, NM. Specialized tools and common burial practices are seen in many archaeological sites through North America and into South America.  

The '''Clovis people''' are one of North America's earliest civilizations. It is not clear if the finds represent one unified tribe, or many tribes with a common technology and belief. Their trek across 2000 rugged miles is one of the great feats of pre-history. Their culture disappears dramatically from the archaeological record 12,900 years ago, with widespread speculation about what caused their disappearance. Theories range from the extinction of the mammoth, to sudden environmental changes caused by a comet hitting the earth, to flooding caused by the break of a massive freshwater lake, Lake Agassiz.

There is controversy about Pre-Clovis settlement of North and South America.  Comparisons of culture and linguistics offer evidence of the influence of early America by several different contemporary cultures.  Some genetic and time-dating studies point to the possibility that ancient Americans came from other places and arrived earlier than at the Clovis sites in North America.  Perhaps some ancient settlers to the hemisphere traveled by boat along the seashore, or arrived by boats from the Polynesian islands.

As time went on, many of these first settlers settled down into agricultural societies, complete with domesticated animals.  Groups of people formed stable tribes and developed distinct languages of their own, to the point that more distant relatives could no longer understand them.  Comparative linguistics -- the study of languages of different tribes -- shows fascinating diversity, with similarities between tribes hundreds of miles apart, yet startling differences with neighboring groups.  

At times, tribes would gain regional importance and dominate large areas of America.  Empires rose across the Americas that rivaled the greatest ones in Europe. For their time, some of these empires were highly advanced.

==Early Empires of Mesoamerica==
Meso-American civilizations are among some of the most powerful and advanced civilizations of the ancient world.  Reading and writing were widespread throughout Meso-America, and these civilizations achieved impressive political, artistic, scientific, agricultural, and architectural accomplishments. Many of these civilizations gathered the political and technological resources to build some of the largest, most ornate, and highly populated cities in the ancient world.

The aboriginal Americans settled in the Yucatan peninsulas of present-day Mexico around 10,000 BCE.  By 2000 BCE, the '''Mayan''' culture had evolved into a complex civilization.  The Mayans developed a strong political, artistic and religious identity among the highly populated Yucatan lowlands.  The classic period (250-900 AD) witnessed a rapid growth of the Mayan culture and it gained dominance within the region and influence throughout present-day Mexico.  Large, independent city-states were founded and became the political, religious, and cultural centers for the Mayan people.  

Mayan society was unified not by politics, but by their complex and highly-developed religion. Mayan religion was astrologically based, and supported by careful observations of the sky. The Mayans had a strong grasp of astronomy that rivaled, and, in many ways, exceeded that of concurrent European societies. They developed a very sophisticated system for measuring time, and had a great awareness of the movements in the nighttime sky. Particular significance was attached to the planet Venus, which was particularly bright and appeared in both the late evening and early morning sky. 

Mayan art is also considered one of the most sophisticated and beautiful of the ancient New World.

The Mayan culture saw a decline during the 8th and 9th century.  Although its causes are still the subject of intense scientific speculation, archaeologists see a definite cessation of inscriptions and architectural construction.  The Mayan culture continued as a regional power until its discovery by Spanish conquistadores.  In fact, an independent, non-centralized government allowed the Mayans to strongly resist the Spanish conquest of present-day Mexico.  Mayan culture is preserved today throughout the Yucatan, although many of the inscriptions have been lost.

The '''Aztec''' culture began with the migration of the Mexica people to present-day central Mexico.  The leaders of this group of people created an alliance with the dominant tribes forming the Aztec triple alliance, and created an empire that influenced much of present-day Mexico.

The Aztec confederacy began a campaign of conquest and assimilation.  Outlying lands were inducted into the empire and became part of the complex Aztec society. Local leaders could gain prestige by adopting and adding to the culture of the Aztec civilization.  The Aztecs, in turn, adopted cultural, artistic, and astronomical innovations from its conquered people.   

The heart of Aztec power was economic unity.  Conquered lands paid tribute to the capital city Tenochtitlan, the present-day site of Mexico City.  Rich in tribute, this capital grew in influence, size, and population.  When the Spanish arrived in 1521, it was the fourth largest city in the world (including the once independent city Tlatelco, which was by then a residential suburb) with an estimated population of 212,500 people. It contained  the massive Temple de Mayo (a twin-towered pyramid 197 feet tall), 45 public buildings,  a palace,  two zoos, a botanical garden, and many houses.  Surrounding the city and floating on the shallow flats of Lake Texcoco were enormous ''chinampas'' -- floating garden beds that fed the many thousands of residents of Tenochtitlan. 

While many Meso-American civilizations practiced human sacrifice, none performed it to the scale of the Aztecs.  To the Aztecs, human sacrifice was a necessary appeasement to the gods.  According to their own records, one of the largest slaughters ever performed happened when the great pyramid of Tenochtitlan was reconsecrated in 1487.  The Aztecs reported that they had sacrificed 84,400 prisoners over the course of four days.  

With their arrival at Tenochtitlan, the Spanish would be the downfall of Aztec culture.  Although shocked and impressed by the scale of Tenochtitlan, the display of massive human sacrifice offended European sensitivity, and the abundant displays of gold and silver inflamed their greed.  The Spanish killed the reigning ruler, Montezuma in June 1520 and lay siege to the city, destroying it in 1521, aided by their alliance with a competing tribe, the Tlaxcala.

With the ascension of Manco Capac to emperor of a tribe in the Cuzco area of what is modern-day Peru around 1200 BCE, the '''Incan''' civilization emerged as the largest Pre-Columbian empire in the Americas.
 
Religion was significant in Inca life. The royal family were believed to be descendants of the Inca Sun God. Thus, the emperor had absolute authority, checked only by tradition. Under the emperors, a complex political structure was apparent. The Incan emperor, regional and village leaders, and others were part of an enormous bureaucracy. For every ten people, there was, on average, one official. The organization of the Empire also included a complex transportation infrastructure. To communicate across the entire empire, runners ran from village to village, relaying royal messages.  

In 1438, the ambitious Pachacuti, likely the greatest of the Incan emperors, came to the throne. Pachacuti rebuilt much of the capital city, Cuzco, and the Temple of the Sun. The success of Pachacuti was based upon his brilliant talent for military command (he is sometimes referred as the &quot;Napolean of the Andes&quot;) and an amazing political campaign of integration.  Leaders of regions that he wanted to conquer were bribed with luxury goods and enticed by promises of privilege and importance. As well, the Incans had developed a prestigious educational system which, not incidentally, just happened to extol the benefits of Incan civilization. Thus, much of the expansion throughout South America was peaceful.

At its height of power in the late 15th century, Incan civilization had conquered a vast patchwork of languages, people and cultures from present-day Ecuador, along the whole length of South America, to present-day Argentina.[[Image:Peru_Machu_Picchu_Sunrise.jpg|thumb|250px|Machu Picchu, the &quot;Lost city of the Incas&quot;.]]Cuzco the capital city, was said by the Spanish to be &quot;as fine as any city in Spain&quot;.  Perhaps the most impressive city of the Incan empire, though,  was not its capital, Cuzco, but the city Machu Picchu.

This mountain retreat was built high in the Andes and is sometimes called the &quot;Lost City of the Incas.&quot;  It was intended as a mountain retreat for the leaders of the Incan empire and demonstrates great artistry -- the abundant dry stone walls were entirely built without mortar, and the blocks were cut so carefully that one can't insert a knife-blade between them.

The Spanish discovered the Inca during a civil war of succession and enjoyed great military superiority over the slow siege warfare that the Incan empire had employed against its enemies.  Fueled by greed at the opportunity to plunder another rich civilization, they conquered and executed the Incan emperor.  The Incan empire fell quickly in 1533, but a small resistance force fled to the mountains, waging a guerrilla war of resistance for another 39 years.

The Meso-American Empires were undoubtedly the most powerful and unified civilizations in the new world.  Writings were common in Meso-America and allowed these cultures to spread in power and influence with far more ease than their counterparts in north America.  Each of these civilizations built impressive urban areas and had a complex culture.  They were as 'civilized' as the Spanish who conquered them in the 15th and 16th centuries.

==Early Empires of the Southwest==

Native Americans adapted the arid desert southwest.  A period of relatively wet conditions saw many cultures in the area flourish.  Extensive irrigation was developed that were among the biggest of the ancient world. Elaborate adobe and sandstone buildings were constructed.  Highly ornamental and artistic pottery was created. The unusual weather conditions could not continue forever, though, and gave way, in time, to the more common drought of the area. These dry conditions necessitated a more minimal way of life and, eventually, the elaborate accomplishments of these cultures were abandoned.

One prominent group were the '''Anasazi''', who lived in the present day Northeastern Arizona and surrounding areas.  The geography of this area is that of a flat arid, desert plain, surrounded by small areas of high plateau, called mesas.  Softer rock layers within the mesas eroded to form steep canyons and overhangs along their slopes. 

The Anasazi culture used these cave-like overhangs in the side of steep mesas as shelter from the brief, fierce southwestern storms.  They also found  natural seeps and diverted small streams of snow melt into small plots of maize, squash and beans.  Small seasonal rivers formed beds of natural clays and dried mud.  The Anasazi used hardened dry mud, called adobe, along with sandstone, to form intricate buildings that were sometimes found high in the natural overhangs of the mesas.  The Anasazi people were also skilled at forming the natural clays into pottery. 

Between 900 - 1130 CE a period of relatively wet conditions allowed the Anasazi people to flourish.  Traditional architecture was perfected, pottery became intricate and artistic, turkeys were domesticated, and trade over long distances influenced the entire region.  Following this golden period was the 300 year drought called Great Drought.  The Anasazi culture was stressed and erupted into warfare.  Scientists once believed the entire people vanished, possibly moving great distances to avoid the arid desert.  New research suggests that the Anasazi dispersed; abandoning the intricate buildings and moving towards smaller settlements to utilize the limited water that existed.

Bordering the Anasazi culture in the north, a separate civilization emerged in southern Arizona, called the '''Hohokam'''.  While many native Americans in the southwest used water irrigation on a limited scale,  it was the Hohokam culture that perfected the technology (all without the benefit of modern powered excavating tools).  The ability to divert water into small agricultural plots meant that the Hohokam could live in large agricultural communities of relatively high population density.  This was particularly true in the Gila River valley, where the Gila River was diverted in many places to irrigate large fertile plains and numerous compact towns.  The bigger towns had a 'Great House' at their centers, which was a large Adobe/stone structure.  Some of these structures were four stories in size and probably were used by the managerial or religious elites.  Smaller excavation or pits were enclosed by adobe walls and used as primary residences.  Smaller pit rooms and pits were used for many different functions.

The successful use of irrigation is evident in the extensive Casa Grande village.  Situated between two primary canals, the Casa Grande site has been the focus of nearly 9 decades of archaeological work.  The original town was built around a Great House and incorporated open courtyards and circular plazas.  By the 10th century neighboring settlements had been built to accommodate a large, highly developed region.  The scale of this community can be seen in the results of one excavation of part of it in 1997.  The project identified 247 pit houses, 27 pit rooms, 866 pits, 11 small canals, a ball court, and portions of four adobe walled compounds.  

The Hohokam culture disintegrated when they had difficulty maintaining the canals in the dry conditions of the drought.  Small blockages or collapses of the canal would choke the intricate irrigation networks. Large towns and extensive irrigation canals were abandoned.  The people gave up their cultural way of life and dispersed into neighboring tribes.

==Early Empires of the Mississippi==

Native Americans in the Eastern Continental United States developed mound-building cultures early in North American History.  Groups of native Americans became more stratified as time went on and developed into tribes.  These tribes participated in long networks of trade and cultural exchanges.  The importance of trade routes developed urban cities of great influence.

The mound-building people were one of the earliest civilization to emerge in North America. Beginning around 1000 BCE cultures developed that used mounds for religious and burial purposes. These mound-building people are categorized by a series of cultures that describe distinctive artwork and artifacts found in large areas throughout the present-day eastern United States. 

The burial mound was the principle characteristic of all of these societies. These large structures were built by piling baskets of carefully selected earth into a mound. Mounds were pyramid shaped with truncated tops. Sometimes small buildings were built on top of them. Some of these mounds were quite large. The Grave Creek Mound, in the panhandle of present day West Virginia, is nearly 70 feet tall and 300 feet in diameter. Other mounds have even been shown to be oriented in a way that allows for astronomical alignments such as solstices and equinoxes.

Mound building cultures spread out in size and importance. The first culture, the '''Adena''', lived in present-day Southern Ohio and the surrounding areas. The succeeding cultures united to create an impressive trade system that allowed each culture to influence the other. The '''Hopewell''' exchange included groups of people throughout the continental Eastern United States. There began to be considerable social stratification within these people. This organization predates the emergence of the tribe as a socio-political group of people that would dominate later eastern and western native American civilization.

The climax of this civilization was the '''Mississippian''' culture. The mound-building cultures had progressed to social complexity comparable to Post-Roman, Pre-Consolidation Tribal England.  Mounds became numerous and some settlements had large complexes of them. Structures were frequently built on top of the mounds.  Institutional social inequalities existed, such as slavery and human sacrifice.  Cahokia, near the important trade routes of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers, became an influential and highly developed community. Extensive trade networks extended from the Great Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico.

Cahokia was one of the great centers of Mississippian culture and its largest settlement of Mississippi.  The focal point of the settlement was the ceremonial mound called Monk's Mound.  Monk's Mound was the largest mound ever constructed by mound-building people and was nearly 100 feet tall and 900 feet long. Excavation on the top of Monk's Mound has revealed evidence of a large building - perhaps a temple - that could be seen throughout the city. The city was spread out on a large plain south of Monks mound.

[[Image:Monks Mound in July.JPG|thumb|400px|Monk's Mound located at the Cahokia site near Collinsville, Illinois.]]

The city proper contained 120 mounds at a varying distances from the city center.  The mounds were divided into several different types, each of which may have had its own meaning and function.  A circle of posts immediate to Monk's Mound marked a great variety of astronomical alignments.  The city was surrounded by a series of watchtowers and occupied a diamond shape pattern that was nearly 5 miles across.  At its best, the city may have contained as many as 40,000 people making it the largest in  North America.

It is likely the Mississippian culture was dispersed by the onslaught of viral diseases, such as smallpox, which were brought by European explorers.  Urban areas were particularly vulnerable to these diseases, and Cahokia was abandoned in the 1500's.  The dispersal of tribes made it impractical to build or maintain mounds and many were found abandoned by European explorers.

==Contact with European Culture ==
European contact brought immediate changes in many tribes of North America.  One of the most significant changes to all Indian tribes was the introduction of viral diseases and epidemics.  Smallpox was probably the single biggest scourge to hit North America.  Infected contagious Indians spread the plague far inland almost immediately after early encounters with European settlers.  Historians estimate that over 80% of all Native Americans died from diseases soon after first contact.  The effects traumatized many powerful and important cultures.  Urban areas were particularly vulnerable and Native American culture adapted by becoming more isolated, less unified, and with a renewed round of inter-tribal warfare as tribes seized the opportunity to gain resources once owned by rivals. 

On the other hand, Europeans brought invasive plants and animals.  The horse was re-introduced to America (as original paleo-American populations of wild horses from the Bering land bridge were extinct) and quickly adapted to free range on the sprawling great plains.  Tribes of nomadic Native Americans were quick to see the horse's value as an increase in their mobility; allowing them to better adapt to changing conditions and as a valuable asset in inter-tribal warfare. Along with Europeans bringing plants and animals, the Europeans were able to take several plants such as corn back to their native countries. 

== Review Questions ==
1. Give two names for the indigenous peoples living in America, and name the circumstances behind each name.

2. What evidence do we have for the Inca, Mayan, and Aztec cultures? 

3. What in the climate contributed to the rise and fall of the indigenous peoples of South-West North America?

Annie - 30&lt;br&gt;
Betty - 51&lt;br&gt;
Carrie - 55&lt;br&gt;
Darla - 46&lt;br&gt;
Eve - 37

== Reasoning ==

=== Symbolic ===

Let the ages and names of Annie, Betty, Carrie, Darla and Eve be A, B, C, D and E.

C says to A, that C = A + 10. If C were younger than A, that would be lying, so C must be older than A. (But still lying.)

We have A &amp;lt; C.

C says to A, that B &amp;lt; D. As C &amp;gt; A, C is lying, so B &amp;gt; D.

We have A &amp;lt; C, D &amp;lt; B.

D says to B, that D = E + 9. As D &amp;lt; B, D is telling the truth, so D &amp;gt; E.

We have A &amp;lt; C, E &amp;lt; D &amp;lt; B, D = E + 9.

E says to B, that E = A + 7. As E &amp;lt; B, E is telling the truth, so E &amp;gt; A.

We have A &amp;lt; C, A &amp;lt; E &amp;lt; D &amp;lt; B, D = E + 9, E = A + 7.

Since D = E + 9 and E = A + 7, D = A + 7 + 9 = A + 16.

We have A &amp;lt; C, A &amp;lt; E &amp;lt; D &amp;lt; B, D = E + 9 = A + 16, E = A + 7.

B says to C, that E &amp;lt; C. If B &amp;gt; C then B would be lying, so then E &amp;gt; C, and then A &amp;lt; C &amp;lt; E &amp;lt; D &amp;lt; B. However, C says to D, that C = D &amp;plusmn; 6; since C &lt; D, this gives C = D - 6.  However, we have E = D - 9, which would make E &amp;lt; C, giving a contradiction.  The assumption that B &amp;gt; C is therefore false, so B &amp;lt; C.

We have A &amp;lt; E &amp;lt; D &amp;lt; B &amp;lt; C, D = E + 9 = A + 16, E = A + 7.

A says to B, that B = (17/10)A. As A &amp;lt; B, A is telling the truth.

We have A &amp;lt; E &amp;lt; D &amp;lt; B &amp;lt; C, B = (17/10)A, D = E + 9 = A + 16, E = A + 7.

B says to C, that |C - D| = |D - E| &amp;rarr; |C - D| = 9. As B &amp;lt; C, B is telling the truth, so C = D + 9. As D = A + 16, C = A + 16 + 9 &amp;rarr; C = A + 25.

We have A &amp;lt; E &amp;lt; D &amp;lt; B &amp;lt; C, B = (17/10)A, C = A + 25, D = A + 16, E = A + 7.

Using D &amp;lt; B &amp;lt; C, we have A + 16 &amp;lt; (17/10)A &amp;lt; A + 25 &amp;rarr; 16 &amp;lt; (7/10)A &amp;lt; 25 &amp;rarr; 160/7 &amp;lt; A &amp;lt; 250/7 &amp;rarr; 22 + 6/7 &amp;lt; A &amp;lt; 35 + 5/7. Since B and A must both be whole numbers, and B = (17/10)A &amp;rarr; B - A = (7/10)A, (7/10)A must be a whole number. Hence A must be divisible by 10. The only whole number fitting 22 + 6/7 &amp;lt; A &amp;lt; 35 + 5/7 is A = 30.

We have A = 30, B = (17/10)A, C = A + 25, D = A + 16, E = A + 7.

Hence A = 30, B = 51, C = 55, D = 46, E = 37.

=== Verbal ===

Carrie tells Annie she's older than her by 10 years.  If Carrie is younger, she's lying, and that's impossible, so Carrie must be older than Annie, just not by 10 years.

'''FACT:''' Carrie is older than Annie (but not by 10 years).

Carrie also lies to (younger) Annie that Betty is younger than Darla.

'''FACT:''' Darla is younger than Betty.

Darla tells the truth to (older) Betty that she's 9 years older than Eve.

'''FACT:''' Darla is 9 years older than Eve.

Eve tells the truth to (older) Betty that she's 7 years older than Annie.

'''FACT:''' Eve is 7 years older than Annie.

Annie tells the truth to (older) Betty that Betty's age is 70% greater than her own.  For Betty's age to be a whole number, Annie's age must be a multiple of 10.  Since Betty is older than Darla, and Darla is 7 + 9 = 16 years older than Annie, that means Betty has to be more than 16 years older than Annie.  The lowest multiple of 7 greater than 16 is 21.

'''FACT:''' Annie is at least 30 years old (and definitely a multiple of 10).

At this point, Betty appears to be the oldest, lying lady.  Let's assume that, and see if it works.

In that case, Carrie is lying to Darla that the difference in their ages is 6 years, but Betty tells the truth to (older) Carrie that the difference between Carrie's age and Darla's is the same as the difference between Darla's and Eve's, namely, 9 years.  Let's test this scenario, assuming Annie's age is 30.  Then we get, from youngest to oldest:

'''TESTING:''' Annie = 30, Eve = 37, Darla = 46, Betty = 51, Carrie = 55

Checking all statements and the age relations shows that this is an answer.  Is this the only answer?

If Annie's age was 40, then Betty's age would be 68, and Carrie's age would be 65, so Carrie would not be the oldest, and that would be a fatal flaw.  If Annie is older than 30, Betty is older than Carrie, and Carrie is not the oldest.  Hence, it must have been the only answer.

&quot;Out of the answers 'left' and 'right', which door would the other guard say doesn't lead to freedom, if I asked her?&quot; - The answer will be the door that leads to freedom. Both guards will answer the same.

'''OR similarly'''

&quot;Would the other guard tell me to go through your door to get to freedom?&quot;  If either guard says &quot;Yes,&quot; go through the other guard's door.  If either says &quot;No,&quot; go through her door..
(Here actually a tautology[always true statement] is being asked from the guard. In simple form we are asking the question &quot;Does freedom gate guard lie?&quot;)

'''OR alternatively'''

Trick question: &quot;If I asked you whether the door you guard is the execution room, would you say yes?&quot; 

If the guard you asked was guarding the freedom room, the lying guard would have said Yes to the simple question &quot;Is this the execution room?&quot;, but when asked whether he would say yes to this simple question, he has to lie and say No to the Trick question. 

If the guard you asked was guarding the freedom room, the true guard would have said No to the simple question &quot;Is this the execution room?&quot;, and when asked whether he would say yes to this simple question, he will truthfully say No to the Trick question.

Thus if it is the freedom door, either guard will give the answer No to the Trick question.

If the guard you asked was guarding the execution room, the lying guard would have said No to the simple question &quot;Is this the execution room?&quot;, but when asked whether he would say yes to this simple question, he has to lie and say Yes to the Trick question. 

If the guard you asked was guarding the freedom room, the true guard would have said Yes to the simple question &quot;Is this the execution room?&quot;, and when asked whether he would say yes to this simple question, he will truthfully say Yes to the Trick question.

Thus if it is the execution door, either guard will give the answer Yes to the Trick question.

Therefore:

If the answer to the trick question by the guard you ask is No - then that guard is guarding the freedom door.

If the answer to the trick question by the guard you ask is Yes - then that guard is guarding the execution door.</text>
