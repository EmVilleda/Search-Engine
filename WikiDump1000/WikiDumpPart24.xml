== Need some order ==
I think we should make RFA look like Wikipedia's one. Now everything is messed up: support, oppose votes, comments, chat etc. There should be clearly separeted sections of: support, oppose votes, questions, comments.

The same problem appears in other votings like [[WB:NP]], which is completely unreadable. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 19:48, 17 October 2005 (UTC)


I don't think it's necessary to do that. I prefer the mix everything in together approach personally. It's a discussion rather than a vote. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 10:58, 19 October 2005 (UTC)

:Apparently, the adminship rules are less strict here, so I don't think there's a need to have a fancy RfA like Wikipedia. I've been here for a few days, and I've discovered that this place and Wikipedia are two different places.

== Admin question ==

I have spent quite a bit of time around the RfA process at en.wiki, and know the ins and outs, but am a little puzzled here. Roughly how long does a user have to be active before adminship is a real possibility? About how many edits? I guess I'm gonna get some response about it is a case-by-case basis and that editcountitis is bad, but I ''would'' like a candid answer. Thanks. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] [[User talk:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;(Dark Mark)&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:31, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

: There are no strict requirements. As for now, you should be &quot;active at Wikibooks for a while&quot; and &quot;known and trusted&quot;. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 18:42, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

::I realise there are no strict requirements. I was just looking for some general answer. What does &quot;active at Wikibooks for a while&quot; even mean? 1 week? 1 month? 3 months? 6 months? 1 year? And I know people have their own standards and such, I am looking for a frank, to the point answer. At Wikipedia, you have a hard time becoming Admin if you haven't been there for around 3 months or have less than 1000 edits. There is no rule, but that seems to be about the line most people have in their standards. I want to know what the general community consensus is here. Thanks. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] [[User talk:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;(Dark Mark)&lt;/font&gt;]] 18:51, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

:::I've been an admin for only a short time now, and I am up to a total of about 1500 edits, and have been a contributer for a relatively short period of time. If you have a good history (even if it is brief), and you ask nicely, you will probably get it if you want it. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:25, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

:::I from what it looks like here, you have less then 100 edits, and you dont seem to have any history before november. If this is the case you are at a pretty good pace, (about 10 edits per day or more), so if you wait another solid month, and maybe help to clean up a spot of vandalism, you would have my vote. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Whiteknight|T]]&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;small&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Whiteknight|C]]&lt;/small&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Emailuser/Whiteknight|E]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:27, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

::::Well, I wasn't thinking about nominating myself any time in the near future, I was just wondering if I ever ''did'' want to run.

Thanks WhiteKnight. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|Lord Voldemort]] [[User talk:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;(Dark Mark)&lt;/font&gt;]] 19:30, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

: You know, edits are not everything. For me, a candidate for admin should be proficient with MediaWiki mechanisms: history, moving, special pages, templates. He should also prove that he knows Wikibooks policies. I don't think an admin should take part in discussion about policies and be active at staff lounge, but I require that he is able to patrol Recentchanges regularly. I would also check if the user does not start arguments and whether his contributions are useful to Wikibooks. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] 19:43, 11 November 2005 (UTC)

:: I like to see people become admins once you have been able to figure out how to use the major tools for editing, like page moves and marking in a watchlist, as well as going beyond just adding a little bit of text to a page.  Participation in discussion, especially on Staff Lounge and the VfD discussions is useful as well.  One huge plus is if you have been able to help out with a vandalism attack and have been able to on your own revert some vandalism and help restore some of the damage without resorting to the use of admin tools.  All of this, plus knowing some of the general policies of Wikibooks is all I look at.  I believe that the quality of the edits is more important than the number of edits anyway.  If you do an edit and put in 20K more content instead of 2000 edits of one word each, I would say the one edit is far more valuable.  Using this philosophy, you could become an admin with just 50 high quality edits where you spend a lot of time reading policies and getting to know the community.  I think it is important that an admin is going to stick around as well, so an admin candidate that created the account just two weeks ago is IMHO less likely to get the admin status than somebody who has been on here for more than a year.

:: Jimbo has suggested that becoming an admin is &quot;not that big of a deal&quot;, and if you are willing to put in a little bit more effort for Wikibooks and help police what is going on, you are certainly encouraged to try and become an administrator.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 02:04, 12 November 2005 (UTC)

:::Well, like I said earlier (and I'm not sure you were directing this totally at me), I am not really interested in &quot;running&quot; for Admin any time soon. And to play Devil's Advocate, I believe he said it is &quot;no big deal&quot;. Cheers. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 15:09, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== Edit limit ==

I suggest creating edit limit for users who want to vote here. I think we may take [[Wikibooks:Collaboration of the Month]] and [[WB:BOTM]] as example and require at least 20 edits. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 20:21, 28 February 2006 (UTC)
:I think a more substantial edit count should be used. 20 edits can happen pretty easily for very new users, and I would think something a bit larger like 50 edits would be better. This ensures a bit more practice around the project. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 21:28, 28 February 2006 (UTC)

::Yeeeah, I think ''some'' minimum should be set, but think we should allow (and encourage if they have something substantive to say) anons and low-edit accounts to '''comment'''. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 00:59, 1 March 2006 (UTC)

: An edit limit seems a good idea.  I have not seen here the same problems with suspicious (may be sock puppets or friends) votes and other such nonsense seen at [[WB:COTM|COTM]] and [[WB:BOTM|BOTM]] (and occasionally [[WB:VFD|VfD]]), so I don't see a need for a higher limit than for those.  If problems arise, then we can raise it.  Or if we need to raise the edit limit for [[WB:COTM|COTM]] and [[WB:BOTM|BOTM]], then we can raise the edit limit here to match.  --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 20:25, 3 March 2006 (UTC)

:::I personally don't like the idea, new users are effected just as much by who becomes an adin as the ones who have been around.  Plus I think that enforcing an edit limit may make a new user feel left out in some cases perhaps, but I agree in that something needs to be in place to prevent sockpuppets from getting involved, perhaps someone with checkuser can &quot;certify&quot; the voting results by checking for sockpuppets, although thats not a fool-proof method, I don't think anything is.[[User:RyanB88|RyanB88]] 21:09, 18 February 2007 (UTC)
::::I agree that newer users should be encouraged to exercise full citizenship. Many have background on WMF, or at RealWorld university. The problem with checkuser is that it is intrusive but maybe a non-judgemental individual could be entrusted to screen for sock-voting.(Probably no way that can be done unintrusively.)The only other idea I have is that the number of user edits could be displayed next to the voter's signature through some sort of software device. If any programmers out there feel like looking into that maybe we can do that and to get fancy, create an algorithm that multiplies users edits times votes for a weighted average. But wait - these aren't votes, they are discussions. This is one of those things with no &quot;right&quot; answer.

==Desysop request==
About the desysop request for my account : It's ok for me to be desysoped here. I don't know if I will contribute here very much in short future. My sysop privilege came essentially from the period when all wikibooks were on the same domain. Now, it's not really useful anymore. What is sure, is that I will not abuse from these privileges, so don't worry, but if you want to remove them, it's ok. [[User:Traroth|Traroth]] 14:13, 17 March 2006 (UTC)

== Sysop Removal Timeline ==

When does everyone think inactive sysops can be re-nominated to be removed of rights? As time goes on many of these admins' inactivity times just lengthen. Perhaps every six months a vote can be held? Also, it might not be a bad idea to define what &quot;inactivity&quot; means here since many of the supposed current votes have been non-consesused due to last-second voting regarding mandatory inactivity rules. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 02:02, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

:Yes. Though it might be better to reconsider the issues again in abstract first. The initial discussions showed there was unanimity amongst those voting to remove those who had made no edit of any description in the last 12 months (unless there are other wikimedia-related matters than need to be taken into consideration). The discussions on the other nominees seem to have stalled - mostly relating to a nomination that was considered by some to be arguing for de-sysopping on fault rather than no fault. This even led to one user opposing the de-sysopping of a user who has consented to his own de-sysopping, which just seems weird - as is the case where a level of inactivity of well over 12 months was broken by one single edit on a usertalk page to thank him for a vote he made on meta.

:The discussion areas for &quot;no fault&quot; de-sysoppings under a &quot;use it or lose it policy&quot; are:

::Complete inactivity over 12 months (excepting those who need reserve rights for Wikimedia Foundation or MediaWiki development reasons) - ''de facto'' already agreed as being reason for de-sysopping
::User request or with the consent of the user - we'd need to agree this, but personally I can't see why this should be controversial
::Complete inactivity over 6 months (excepting those who need reserve rights for Wikimedia Foundation or MediaWiki development reasons) - there was around 80% support for this looking at the nominations on the project page - maybe we can agree this in the abstract
::Inactivity over 12 months - ie there was some activity (maybe fewer than 10 edits, or no edits to the main namespace) - again, there was some significant support for this looking at the nominations - maybe this is worth discussing again in the abstract
::Intermittent (or continuing) editing activity, but no usage of sysop-only rights for a 12 month period - again, maybe this is worth discussing again in the abstract

:[[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 06:40, 11 April 2006 (UTC)

I oppose establishing any such timeline without the general discussion suggested by [[User:Jguk|Jguk]].  We seemed to have at least more or less agreed to do some housecleaning of inactive Admins at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2006/February#Removing Sysop Status|Staff Lounge discussion]].  But the consensus spoiling &quot;last minute votes&quot; seem to indicate that we had less of a consensus than we had thought.  In the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2006/February#Removing Sysop Status|Staff Lounge discussion]], [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] suggested we should have a policy on these issues.  [[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]]'s horror expressed as &quot;Oh dear, not another new policy&quot; reply notwithstanding, I support having a policy or guideline on the matter (possibly new or possibly worked into existing policies).  In the recent vote, there seemed to be some confusion both over what we ''were'' doing and over what we ''should'' have been doing.  Were we desysopping those with no activity for 12 months?  No activity for 6 moths?  Desysopping those with non-admin activity only for 6 or 12 months?  Desysopping those with no non-admin activity outside their own books?  I changed one of my votes over such confusion.  There was even disagreement over whether we should be having no-fault desysopping votes at all.  Having a policy or even a guideline to point to might even have ameliorated a bit the contretemps that occurred over [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship/Archive#Marshman ( talk .7C email .7C_contribs )| Marshman's vote]] (okay, well, maybe that one's a stretch).

I don't have much of a position on the issues raised by [[User:Jguk|Jguk]].  Here is what little I do have:

* No-fault desysopping due to 12 months inactivity (whether that's complete inactivity, near complete inactivity, non-admin inactivity, etc.) is more likely to garner a consensus than desysoping due to 6 months inactivity.  I base that on the discussions both at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Archives/2006/February#Removing_Sysop_Status|the Staff Lounge discussion]] and at the desysopping votes themselves.  I like consensus.  Consensus is good.  :-)

* Assuming we have set times for these desysopping votes or time spans between them, we should consider not holding a desysopping vote for the same admin two times in a row.  As long as they are not doing any damage, I don't want to give the impression that we're piling on.  If that adopted, it might argue for holding housecleaning desysop votes twice a year rather than yearly.

* Perhaps we should maintain a strict wall between for-cause desysop votes and no-fault housecleaning desysop votes.  For-cause reasons for desysopping are of a ''very'' different type than no-fault housecleaning desysop votes.  I don't see a little bit of for-cause and a little bit of no-fault reasons supporting each other.  For-cause and no-fault desysoppings need to stand by themselves as sufficient.  On the other hand, the &quot;piling on&quot; problem concerns me here.  Consider [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship/Archive#Marshman ( talk .7C email .7C_contribs )| Marshman's case]].  How much nastier would that fight have been if we held one type of vote (for-cause or no-fault) first and then the other type a month later.  I don't right now have any brilliant ideas as to how to separate for-cause and no-fault votes without leaving us susceptible to piling on problems.  But I do feel that such a brilliant idea would be highly desirable.

== How do I know if I have certain permissions? ==

I haven't worked with Wikibooks for a bit, but am the one that created the [[How to use a Motorola DVR]] book. It looks like flagged revisions have been added, but I have no idea how to 'approve' items. There is mention that some submit or other buttons should show up, but I don't see that.

:CUs have a minimum requirement of support &quot;votes&quot;, take a look in Adrignola's nomination.  It shouldn't be a static number but a percentage based on the active administrators.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 14:31, 15 August 2010 (UTC)

::Actually, the requirement is at least 25 votes.  It's the last bastion of an actual vote.  It should be based on project size, but it's not. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 15:16, 15 August 2010 (UTC)

:::After a fixed minimum number of votes, the next simplest arrangement would perhaps be a number simply proportional to active admins, which would seem to make it too easy for tiny projects and prohibitively difficult for huge projects.  One might supplement that with absolute lower and upper bounds on the required minimum, or go for something even more baroque (logarithmic scale, anyone?).  But the more complicated you make it, the harder it is to use and the more of a controversy magnet it becomes.

:::Smaller projects are given some relief in trying to scrape up the requisite numbers by the fact that there is no fixed limit on how long a CU vote can remain open.  Sanity checks are that the whole local community has to have been properly notified of the vote ('''which, since we haven't clearly settled on what we're doing, has not yet happened here'''), and that once you claim to have the requisite level of consensus, you have to request at Meta, which gives the Stewards a chance to look over the proceedings to see if there's anything dicey about them.

Thus I would suggest erring on the side of (a) less is more regarding CU's but more importantly (b) quality more important than quantity in that CU's should have a very detailed understanding of rights and responsibilities, be accessible to folks with less technical expertise and have a demonstrated record of wielding power judiciously, NPOV and fairly. My bottom line is that I use properly disclosed multiple accounts for lawful purposes, like protecting my sanity from POV warriors, and I don't doubt that someday a POV Warrior will try to use CU and attempt to characterize my lawful-per-policy multiple accounts as somehow indicative of (evil vampire soundtrack) &quot;socking&quot;.

'''Ruby''' is an [[w:interpreted|interpreted]], object-oriented [[w:programming|programming]] language. Its creator, [[Wikipedia:Yukihiro Matsumoto|Yukihiro Matsumoto]], a.k.a “Matz,” released it to the public in 1995.  Its history is covered [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming_Language here].  Its many features are listed [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_Programming_Language#Features here].

The book is currently broken down into several sections and is intended to be read sequentially.  [[#Getting started|Getting started]] will show how to install and get started with Ruby in your environment. [[#Basic Ruby|Basic Ruby]] demonstrates the main features of the language syntax. The [[#Ruby language|Ruby language]] section is organized like a reference to the language.
[[#Available Standard Library Modules|Available modules]] covers some of the standard library.  [[#Intermediate Ruby|Intermediate Ruby]] covers a selection of slightly more advanced topics.  Each section is designed to be self contained.

=== Available Standard Library Modules ===

These are parts of Ruby that you have available (in the standard library, or via installation as a gem).
To use them you typically have to require some filename, for example &lt;code&gt;require 'tracer'&lt;/code&gt; would make accessible to you the Tracer class.

You can see a list of basically all the (std lib ruby) modules available in the [http://github.com/ruby/ruby/tree/trunk/lib/ ruby source] and [http://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/trunk/lib/README lib readme].  There are a several more modules available in the std lib, which are C based extensions.  You can see their list [http://github.com/ruby/ruby/tree/trunk/ext here].

* [[/Standard Library/BigDecimal|BigDecimal]] gives you a way to have arbitrary precision Decimal style numbers.  Never succumb to rounding errors again!
* [[/Standard Library/Debugger|Debugger]] gives you a way to step through debug your Ruby code.
* [[/Standard Library/DRb|Distributed Ruby]] (DRb) gives you a way to make remote procedure calls against objects in a different VM.

----
Have you ever noticed a crackle when you pull off a sweater? Have you ever had your hair stick to your face after combing? What about seeing a balloon stick to the wall after it has been rubbed? All these effects are caused by '''static electricity'''. Static electricity is the imbalanced charges of matter.  It was the Greeks who first noticed that when they rubbed a piece of amber, it attracted small pieces of paper. The Greek word for amber is elektron, and it is from this that we get our words electron and electricity.

==What causes static electricity?==
Usually materials are electrically neutral. This means that they are ''not'' electrically charged. However this doesn't mean that materials have no charges ''inside'' them. All materials are made of atoms.  Atoms are made of particles called electrons, protons, and neutrons.  Electrons have a negative charge, protons have a positive charge, and neutrons (as you can probably guess by the name) have no charge.  Materials are partly made of charged particles.  Materials have no overall charge whenever they have the same number of electrons and protons. The negative charge of the electrons exactly cancels out the positive charge of the protons. 

'''Test YourSelf:''' 
Q1) The element lithium  has three protons. How many electrons must a neutral lithium atom have?

Inside an atom the protons and neutrons are held firmly at the very centre in a structure called the nucleus. The electrons however are held much more loosely. Some can be found at the surface, and if the surface is rubbed, they can be rubbed away. This removal of electrons will leave the atom with more protons than electrons. It will have a positive charge because the protons are positively charged. Atoms that are charged are called ions.

When you rub a balloon on your sweater some of the electrons are transferred from the sweater to the balloon. The sweater becomes positively charged. 

'''Test YourSelf:''' 
Q2) What charge will the balloon have?

==How do the two types of charge behave?==

The sweater is positively charged, the balloon negative. The balloon sticks to the sweater. This is because '''unlike charges attract'''. If you were to take two balloons, both of which had been negatively charged and brought them together you would find that they tried to push apart. This is because '''like charges repel'''.

[[Image:Balloons (static electricity).png]]

''' Test Yourself''' 
Q3) Look at the balloons above. The pair on the left are being repelled. The pair on the right are being attracted. Notice that one out of each pair of balloons is negatively charged. What is the sign (positive or negative) of the charges on the other two balloons?

==Sparks can fly!==



When a large enough charge is built up sparks can fly. A spark is just a flow of electrons through the air. This can sometimes be very dangerous. For example, petrol flowing through a pipeline can pick up a charge by friction. If a spark flies it could ignite the petrol. For this reason, pipes are earthed. Earthing means connecting the pipe to the ground by means of a copper wire. Copper, unlike air, is a very good conductor of electricity. The electrons can flow easily and safely to the ground without sparking.

Some devices make use of sparks. A Van de Graaf generator consists of a large metal dome that is in contact with a rubber or plastic looped belt. As the belt moves, friction causes it to become charged; the charge is spread out over the metal dome where it builds up until it is large enough to cause a spark.


&lt;center&gt;[[Image:Girl touch Van de Graaf.png]]&lt;/center&gt;

In the diagram above a girl is standing on a washing up bowl and touching a Van de Graaf machine.

'''Test Yourself'''
Q4) What do you think is the purpose of the washing up bowl?

'''Test Yourself'''
Q5) Explain why the girl's hair is standing on end (no it's not her style, it's to do with the charge)

'''Summary'''
*Friction can cause electrons to rub off one material onto another
*Two objects with the same type of charge repel
*Two objects with the opposite type of charge attract
*To prevent sparks, discharge the object by connecting it to earth with a metal conductor
*To encourage sparks, insulate the object

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey Theresa knott, looks like an exciting project. Best of luck and welcome to the textbook project. We're gonna like change the world, an' stuff ! Thanks for the help. (I added a couple of navigation links for you) ... --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Thanks for the links! We certainly are gonig to change the world, but it's a daunting prospect this early on. Still little by little -- [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 10:29, 29 Aug 2003 (UTC)

I've been thinking. I sort of hijacked this page for GCSE science. It occurs to me that someone visiting this page migh want see see things on the scientific method, anyalysing data, Good and not so good science. Examples of downright sloppy science and even fraud. That sort of thing.If anyone want's reclaim this page for general science rather than GCSE science, feel free, but please link GCSE science to the main page or somewhere it is likely to be seen [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 21:36, 18 Sep 2003 (UTC)

:Very chivalrous of you. I imagine that as this site grows there will be all kinds of overlaps on name usage, with multiple books and stuty guides on any topic. Hopefully there will be so much activity that people will be fighting over namespaces. Well, not that I am hoping for fighting. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

== Tweaks ==
Theresa, love the design of the page. I tweaked it up a bit for you. Question: Just what does &quot;GCSE&quot; stand for, anyways ? If I knew I forgot and don't know where to check. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Thanks for the tweaks. GCSE stands for General certificate of secondary education. 

:&lt;headmistress giving a &quot;you should know better&quot; look&gt; 
The best place to check for information is wikipedia ;-) see this article for more details http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/GCSE 
:&lt;/headmistress giving a &quot;you should know better&quot; look&gt; [[User:Theresa knott]]

::Headmistress ? OK, this must definitely be a non-US thing. Seriously, I have never heard of General certificate of secondary education before. I thought the S would stand for science ..

== Funny science songs ==
You may like the songs found on this page. Sort of more designed for kids but it was funny to me as an adult too. Maybe it could fit into your book somewhere although I wouldn't know where.

http://www.acme.com/jef/science_songs/

- Thank you

== Subpages ==
Wouldn't it be better to use subpages? For example, right now you have &quot;GCSE_science&quot; and &quot;Introduction_(GCSE_science)&quot; and so on. With subpages, they would be &quot;GCSE_science&quot; and &quot;GCSE_science/Introduction&quot; and so on. It seems tider to me because all the GCSE science pages are then contained under 'GCSE_science'. Just a thought. :) --[[User:Avxxv|Avxxv]] 20:10, 15 October 2005 (UTC)

:Subpages is a feature that was added long after this book was created. Sure, having subpages will be much tidier, but things will have to be moved in a way to not ruin internal links. --[[User:Krackpipe|Krackpipe]] 18:58, 7 December 2005 (UTC)

== Proposed rename ==

I'd like to change these pages so that they all start with &quot;GCSE Science/&quot;. This would bring these pages into link with other wikibooks. Any move would be done in such a way as to preserve all links. I trust this will prove to be non-controversial, but note the proposal here first to allow for comments, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:50, 24 February 2006 (UTC)

== Image format ==

A lot of images in this textbook are in GIF format. They should be converted to PNG, or a PNG alternative should be found. [[User:Ksd5|Emanla Eraton]] 15:26, 26 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''Q1)''' 3 --- all atoms have the same number of protons as electrons


'''Q2)''' Negative ---	electrons have been added to the balloon.


'''Q3 left hand pair)'''  Negative--- The balloons are  repelled

'''Q3 right hand pair)'''Positive --- The balloons are attracted. Remember '&quot;like charges repel, unlike charges attract'''   


'''Q4)''' The purpose of the washing up bowl is to insulate the girl from the ground. People are reasonable conductors of electricity. If the girl just stood on the floor electricity would run through her body and leak away. She would act as an earth wire for the Van de Graaf.

'''Q5)''' The girl's hairs all pick up static electricity from the Van de Graaf machine.  Remember '''like charges repel''', so each hair tries to get as far away from the other hairs as possible. That is why her hair stands on end.

Theresa, what program are you using to make those drawings ? Just wondering .. Hey never mind, I just checked your user page on the main WP and saw that you have links and info about it .. you use MS Word ?? Interesting ... I hope you keep up the passion. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Thanks, Theresa. You've really restored my confidence in the whole Wikibooks thing. I've encountered a lot of unwritten, poorly-written or excessively incomprehensible stuff, and what I see with GCSE Science is a breath of fresh air! Keep up the good work, it's of sufficient quality to actually see it competing with other major textbooks. Well done! --[[User:81.157.26.41|81.157.26.41]] 21:31, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Theresa, sub-pages are any page that contains a '/' in the page name. Normally, a slash in the URL indicates a file structure or directory entry on the server. They were used a lot in Wikipedia, but have mostly been removed there.
We've discussed them here as a possible way to solve the need for duplicate modules. Thus ''GCSE/Atomic Structure'' would be different than ''Physics/Atomic Structure''. The Wikipedia approach would be to name these modules ''Atomic Structure in General Science'', but this seems combersome.
Another approach involvers the use of Namespaces. This would get things like ''GCSE:Atomic Structure''.

There are a couple of us experimenting with things like automated table of contents and pop-up windows for footnotes or a glossary. When we get a good technique that works, we'll update or create a guideline page. In the meantime, most of us are just continuing whatever method a book started with. We know we'll have some cleanup when a good technique is settled on. Hope this explains some of whats going on. Keep up the good work, and I second Karl's praise for your illustrations.

==Covalent bonding==
Hey Theresa, thanks for your edits on the organic subpages. This statement from [[Organic Chemistry/Foundational concepts of organic chemistry/Covalent bonding|Covalent bonding]] does not seem to be true tho: &quot;Covalent bonds always occur in molecules that only have one type of atom&quot;. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
----
I was just looking at your science book. It sure is a large volume to cover. Do you plan on writing the whole thing ? I see your edits all of the time for quite some time now and yet the volume left to go is much larger than that which is done. I guess my book is the same tho, and when I finish ochem its on to other subjects .. Oh yeah, I hope you approve of the edit I did on the main science book page. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
:It certainly is a large amount of work. If I do it all by myself on and off as the mood takes me it'll take maybe two or three years to complete. Still nothing worth doing is easy. What I hope will happen, when I get the electricity module really well done, a proper useable resource, then people might start actually using it. If that happens {well I should say when that happens) someone else may be inspired to write another module, Still if I have to do the whole thing myself I will. Oh and yes the edit on general science is good.[[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 21:21, 18 Sep 2003 (UTC)
==Evangelizing==
By the way, I was talking up your page to a guy I ran into at work who is an eighth-grade teacher, saying how it is coming along and everything. He was pretty excited about it. As we get along farther on these things I think growth will accelarate. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Theresa - The main page was perfectly fine before (Statement not true about whatever size screen you have ~ I never had to scroll right left. Not sure what the proper sizing is, but the central contents area looks a bit squeezed now - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 21:18, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC) I think the problem arises from that little box added at top right. -- [[User:Marshman|Marsh]]

Theresa - I'm using IE.  The html width % tags should adjust things for both individual browser and screen resolutioon settings (all things functioning perfectly).  By adjusting the contents table to 80% it did get smaller on my screen, but everything else around (above and below) stayed the same (the tables are nested), so there was no right-left adjustment in text outside the colored contents box.  Is it (on your browser) actually filling more than full screen width?  Usually, that is caused by something forcing the width out of specified bounds (e.g., a line or graphic that is too large for screen setting, or something similar in essence overriding the percent width commands) - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 22:55, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I too am using IE. I think the problem that have is to do with the navigation frame on the L.H.S. of the page. (the one with the wikibooks logo) This takes up about 20% of the page width, so if the tables set at 100% the page will always be wider than the browser window. I don't see why we need to set a width at all really, so I've removed the width attributes entirely, letting the viewers browser decide how wide to make the table. Does this look ok to you ? [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 09:17, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Did removing the Width=100% make any difference on your browserr? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:37, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)
:Yes it's cured the problem for me. Does it still look OK to you? [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 23:03, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)
::After I brought the three columns a bit closerr to same size, it looks fine on my screen, but only fills about 80% of the available space.  If it was off screen with 100% setting on your monitor, then something must be forcing the layout wide (and the colored box table complies by filling 100% of &quot;too big&quot;); but I cannot see what that is.  Most suspicious is the longer titles in the book listings. That is all I can see that could overide settings as there are no wide graphics anywhere.  What does the French Wikibooks main page look like on your system?  It is fine on mine. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 00:49, 6 Nov 2003 (UTC)

== Foundation or Higher? ==

As far as I know, there is no Foundation or Higher. It is law that schools (except public schools...) have to have balanced sciences.

There is Single Science, 6 modules, Double Science, 12 modules, or Seperate Sciences, 18 modules.

Single Science makes you do 6 modules in the 2 GCSE years and you recieve one grade (from * down to F/U/similar).

Double Science makes you do 12 modules in the 2 GCSE years and you recieve two identical grades (from ** down to FF/UU/similar). They can never be different so excelling in Chemistry will not get you very far.

Seperate Sciences (that's me!) is like taking a Biology, Physics and Chemistry GCSE. Each have 6 modules and you get three seperate grades.

What's Foundation and Higher? [[User:R3m0t|R3m0t]] 16:52, 5 Dec 2003 (UTC)

It's the paper you sit in many exam boards Foundation is balanced, you still get 12 modules for doulble science, but the papers omit the most difficult questions. You can get grades C downwards. The higher paper is gives grades A -D any lower than that you get a U. The paper sat is not specified on the final certificate though, A grade C For example can be got by sitting either paper and nobody but the candidate need know which paper was sat.  [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 08:31, 7 Dec 2003 (UTC)

== Algebra:Functions images ==

Thanks for those.  The apple picture is great!  I'm going to move the second illustration down from the relation section to the function part; any chance you could make another similar picture demonstrating a relation that's not a function (ie., at least one right-hand element points to more than one left-hand element)?  That would really make the distinction clear.  --[[User:Spikey|Spikey]] 01:35, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC)

Hi T :) If you do intend on resizing the image yourself, you may want to simplify it just a little, it may be a bit complicated on sight to spot that it isn't a function - perhaps have the mapping 1-&gt;{2,3}, 2-&gt;3, 3-&gt;4, 4-&gt;4? Just a suggestion, really, no big deal if you don't wanna change it! :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:45, 20 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I'm in year 10, doing Triple Science, AS Mathematics and I'm doing a Chemistry coursework this term. I already did Chemical Patterns, Chemistry in Action and Energy and Electricity and got three A*s (woohoo!). Also finishing Human Body unit and starting Waves, Atoms and Space. I'll try come along to the [[GCSE Science]] and help out when I can :) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 10:41, 16 Jan 2004 (UTC)

: Well, so far I've done... um... let's see. I've done ''Chemical Patterns'', ''Chemistry in Action'', ''The Human Body'', ''Inheritance and Survival'', ''Energy and Electricity'', ''Waves, Atoms and Space'' - that's all of Single Science. Also finished ''Health and Exercise'' and ''Chemicals of the Earth'' (I think that's it) in Double Science. Also currently doing ''Movement and Change'', in Double, which I started on the 24th. I recieve my Chemistry coursework next week.
: Well, this is going to sound really stupid, but... what do you need help with? :) I would much prefer ''Movement and Change'' because that's what I'm doing right now.

==editing feature==
Theresa, have you seen the feature where little boxes show up at the top of the editing box that let you do some formatting in one click ? I was on a friend's computer and these icons showed up that I had never seen, to make text bold or italic, among other things. Maybe it does not work on my Mac or something. Do you know what I am talking about ? It was an XP home edition machine that I saw it on, but the XP pro version work does not seem to support it. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

forgive my ignorance but for the life of me i can't get the venus image to post from the wikipedia article over to the module. why is this? i was also thinking of bringing the tables from the articles explaining the planet stats. can you help me out maybe post a tutorial type of thing on my talk page here. sorry to bother you. oh and p.s. i look forward to working on this project with everyone, i beleive it will be a great success! --[[User:Larsie|Larsie]] 16:50, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:It can't be done! (Which explains why you can't do it) However a new project called wikicommons has just been launched. This is a central repository for wikimedia pictures. I ''think'' you can get images from commons to display on any wiki, but I don't know for sure as I've never tried it. Take a look [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Main_Page here] and see if you can figure it out.

== nasa ==

hey there would you be able to tell me where i can find info on how to bring the nasa image from the site to the module? --[[User:Larsie|Larsie]] 18:16, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Go to the NASA site and download the image onto your harddrive. (Clicking on the image and selecting &quot;save as&quot; should do it. Make sure you save it where you can find it again. Change the name if necessary; it should be descriptive. then click the upload button and navigate yo where the file is on your computer. Put the public domain tag in the summary and also add that it's from NASA then hit the upload button. Let me know if you have any problems. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 20:10, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

i actually know how to format now it's just that i can't download images as i use my work pc for all my contributions so i don't have the ability to gather images and upload them, sorry. --[[User:Larsie|Larsie]] 20:57, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

check out what i did for the venus category (the image showing venus in blue) is that ok or should i not do it like that. --[[User:Larsie|Larsie]] 21:07, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)
:No you can't do that. What you are doing is retreiving the image live from their website everytime you look at the page. This has two consiquences
:#If their website is down for any reason, or if they decide to move the image location or name, we'll see a &quot;missing image&quot; note instead.
:#Because the viewers browser fetches the image from thier website rather than ours, ''they'' have to pay for the bandwith rather than us. bandwith theft is considered extremely poor etiquette.

You best bet is to just put the url on the talk page and let someone else sort adding it to the page. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 06:48, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I like this diagram.  Could I have a go at it?  I'd be happy to correct the typo.
Also, I'd like to create a new version, under a different name.  It would have the photosphere, chromosphere, and corona labelled.  I see a comment here from Karl Wick that you create your images in MS Word.  If that's true, I should be able to edit in MS Word, right?  Could you upload the &quot;original&quot; picture file or a Word document with the picture file in it.
I could download, work on them, and report back to you on what I've done with your baby.  --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 16:23, 23 August 2005 (UTC)

Thanks for responding to my message.  I appreciate your invitation to re-use your image. I thought the original version -- in the format you had when you were editing it, before you saved it as a PNG -- would be better than the png, because it might have more bits.  If I start working from a copy, I could just degrade the image.  Thanks if you can enlighten me. --[[User:SV Resolution|SV Resolution]] 00:52, 29 August 2005 (UTC)

== Question ==

Hi THeresa! I just registered today, and I have a question about articles on Wikibooks. Are there cases here where blank pages are accepted? I saw [[European History/Chapter 14]] was created today and saw that [[European History/Chapter 13]] is in a similar vein. Just wondered because Chapter 13 seems to be several years old. [[User:Sjakkalle|Sjakkalle]] 11:30, 26 April 2006 (UTC)
:I can't for the life of me see why someone needs to create a totally blank page. Books are different from encylopedias because they need to be structured. So obviosly chapter 13 should come before chapter 14 in the contents page, but once there is a link there I can't see a reason to actually create the page blank. I'll leave it a little while as the book is clearly being worked on (if not that chapter) and see what happens. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 11:36, 26 April 2006 (UTC)

You left a note on the &quot;Ellastic Collisions&quot; page of the Process Control Wikibook. I am currently merging that old book into the new [[Control Systems]] book. I am copying the text verbatim from this page into the [[Talk:Control Systems|Discussion page]].

== School Project ==

I'm probably going to be a TA next semester, and I was toying with the idea of offering my students extra credit for making (class-related) contributions to wikibooks. I saw your school project, and would very much like to know how well it is working out for your students, how easy it is to teach wikiformatting to people who may be completely unfamiliar with text markup etc. I think it's very admirable for you to be getting young people involved, not only in the learning process, but also in the teaching process as well. Kudos to you! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[Control Systems|current]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:14, 4 May 2006 (UTC)

:Well they seem to be enjoying it! I haven't actually taught much formatting at all; some of the brighter ones are picking it up for themselves. It's very easy after all, and the nice thing about a wiki is that someone else can always fix the formatting later.

:You need to think carefully about safety. My pupils are all quite young, so I gave them a very stern talking to about how they are allowed to behave online, and i vetted their usernames etc. You also need to think about staff pupil relationships. If the pupils are teenagers I recommend that you create a seperate account for yourself for use in the project and keep you main account secret from them. 

:Thanks for your kind words, but children love to show off what they know. When the term ends I'm going to print up the pages and bind them together into a little booklet and give them a copy each to take home. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 05:17, 5 May 2006 (UTC)

Please inform your students to obey our naming conventions. They mess up a little creating pages like &quot;simple switch&quot; (I have just deleted one thinking it is a vandalism). It's very simple, you just need to write &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/pagename/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Pagename|pagename]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[pagename]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 08:57, 11 May 2006 (UTC)

== Great! ==

So happy to have a contributor! The standards you suggest are right on the money. &quot;key stage three&quot; as you call it is exactly the same age group I was aiming for. As for science currently learned, It vairies from school to school but generally they will have had basic environmental science, weather, some geology, basic electricity, etc... In the USA, public school texts do not focus enough on laboratory experimentation as a form of learning. Because of this, i would like the book to have a large basis in experimentation, lab work and procedure, and careful observation as methods of learning material covered in the book, but also as preparation for high school science (ages 14-18) where this sort of analysis is required.  I look forward to working with you! please feel free to edit any part of the book that you find a way to improve! Thanks for the offer!

I didn't &quot;add&quot; the Swastika the next day. It was always there. It's been The Vandal Warrior's page for ages and no one mentioned it to me. When that user removed he didn't put a good enough reason for removing it, so I put it back and explained me reason, then he put it back still without any discussion, so I reverted it, then he blocked my user page and still didn't discuss it. Then I asked him why he did via email... No email reply and guess what? I got my email blocked! Great... I really was going to do as you said, but none of this would have happened, if he talked about it with me or maybe if you did... or if anyone did, rather than just getting blocked. It seems unfair to be blocked from email someone when all I did was ask him why he reverted it?! And still no reply! What's going on with Wikipedia. What happened to the politeness and respect I had for administrators? [[Special:Contributions/86.29.128.62|86.29.128.62]] ([[User talk:86.29.128.62|talk]]) 16:56, 14 May 2008 (UTC)</text>

There are several practical uses of   static electricity. We will look at two of them on this page. There are many more, but these are probably the easiest to understand.

==The Photocopier==
One example of the practical use of static electricity is a photocopier. A photocopier is a complicated piece of equipment, but the basic principle of how it works is fairly simple. The best way to understand what is going on is to consider it as a stage by stage process.

{|
|-
| colspan=&quot;4&quot; | [[Image:Stages of how a photocopier works.png]]
|-
| Stage 1 || Stage 2 || Stage 3 || Stage 4
|}

===Stage one===
Positive charge is sprayed onto a plate from a high voltage power supply which is called charging by friction. The plate is connected to the earth but the charge does not have quite enough energy to flow away from it. (The plate is not a good conductor of electricity.)

===Stage two ===
Paper is placed over the plate and a light is shone onto the paper. Where the paper is white the light is reflected onto the plate. Where the paper is dark a shadow falls onto the plate. The light falling on the plate gives it just the extra energy needed to allow the  charge to escape to earth. The plate becomes neutral where the paper is white but keeps its charge where the paper is black. The plate is now a copy of the paper with charges taking the place of ink. You could call this a template.

===Stage three ===
Toner particles are sprayed through a negatively charged nozzle onto the plate. As the toner passes through the nozzle it picks up the charge so that each particle of toner becomes negatively charged. The now charged toner is attracted to the areas of positive charge because '''unlike charges attract'''. More light then allows the positive charge to escape (However the negative charge on the toner remains.)

===Stage four ===
A piece of paper is given a very strong positive charge, and then placed in contact with the plate. The paper attracts the toner. The paper is then removed from the plate and passed through a heating unit. The heat melts the toner and bonds it to the paper. 

In a real photocopier, there is no plate, just a large drum. As the drum rotates its surface goes through stages one through four.  At the end of the sequence a scraper removes any toner left on the drum and the whole process is repeated with a new image. A good photocopier is capable of producing 20 duplicate pages per minute (20ppm), which is approximately one page every three seconds.

===Questions on Photocopiers ===
'''Q1)''' If the black areas of the image leave a positive charge on the plate what charge do the white areas of the image leave? (''Be very careful, the answer may not be what you think!'')

'''Q2)''' How does the light shining onto the charged plate allow it to lose its charge?

'''Q3)''' Why is the toner given a negative charge?

'''Q4)''' Why does the paper attract the toner?

{| bgcolor=&quot;ffeeaa&quot;
|-
|
'''Summary'''
*A photocopier uses a static electricity image to attract ink
*Unlike charges attract, the image and the ink are oppositely charged
*Unlike charges attracting is also used when spray painting cars
|}

==Other uses of static electricity==

===Spray painting  car parts===
When paint is sprayed from a paint gun, the painter normally needs to use a fair amount of skill to ensure the paint goes on evenly. By connecting the spray nozzle to a negative electrode, it is possible to charge each droplet of paint. If the car part is then given the opposite charge, the paint droplets will be attracted to the car body part. This has several advantages:
*Less mess - The paint goes to the charged body part and not to the electrically neutral floor.
*Less wastage - All the paint ends up on the body part, very little is wasted.
*Less skill needed - Because the charge is over the entire car part, the paint will stick to it.
*Neater job - The paint is distributed evenly across the surface

===Questions===
'''Q1)''' If the paint droplets are given a positive charge, what charge should the car part be given?

'''A1)''' A negative charge as the positive will always be looking for a negative to balance it out. 

'''Q2)''' Why does less paint fall on the floor? Give reasons for your answer

'''Q3)''' In the application of painting cars, wouldn't negatively charging the spray source and positively charging the object being sprayed also attract dust, dirt and, trash too?

===Pollution Control===
Static electricity is used in pollution control by applying a static charge to dirt particles in the air and then collecting those charged particles on a plate or collector of the opposite electrical charge. Such devices are often called electrostatic precipitators.


Factories use static electricity to reduce pollution coming from their smokestacks. They give the smoke an electric charge. When it passes by electrodes of the opposite charge, most of the smoke particles cling to the electrodes. This keeps the pollution from going out into the atmosphere.

      <comment>/* Special Graphs */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A ''graph'' is a mathematical way of representing the concept of a &quot;network&quot;.

== Introduction ==
A network has points, connected by lines. In a graph, we have special names for these. We call these points ''vertices'' (sometimes also called nodes), and the lines, ''edges''.

Here is an example graph. The edges are red, the vertices, black.

[[File:Discrete Mathematics Example Graph.png]]

In the graph, &lt;math&gt;v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4&lt;/math&gt; are vertices, and &lt;math&gt;e_1, e_2, e_3, e_4, e_5&lt;/math&gt; are edges.

== Definitions of graph==
There are several roughly equivalent definitions of a '''graph'''.  Most commonly, a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is defined as an ordered pair &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;V=\{v_1,\ldots,v_n\}&lt;/math&gt; is called the graph's '''vertex-set''' and &lt;math&gt;E=\{e_1,\ldots,e_m\}\subset\{\{x,y\}|x,y\in V\}&lt;/math&gt; is called the graph's '''edge-set'''.  Given a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, we often denote the vertex—set by &lt;math&gt;V(G)&lt;/math&gt; and the edge—set by &lt;math&gt;E(G)&lt;/math&gt;.  To visualize a graph as described above, we draw &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; dots corresponding to vertices &lt;math&gt;v_1,\ldots, v_n&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, for all &lt;math&gt;i,j\in\{1,\ldots,n\}&lt;/math&gt; we draw a line between the dots corresponding to vertices &lt;math&gt;v_i, v_j&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exists an edge &lt;math&gt;\{v_i,v_j\}\in E&lt;/math&gt;.  Note that the placement of the dots is generally unimportant; many different pictures can represent the same graph.

Alternately, using the graph above as a guide, we can define a graph as an ordered triple &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E,f)&lt;/math&gt;:
* a set of vertices, commonly called V
* a set of edges, commonly called E
* a relation &lt;math&gt;f: E \rightarrow \{\{x,y\}|x,y\in V\}&lt;/math&gt; that maps to each edge a set of ''endpoints'', known as the ''edge-endpoint relation''.  We say an edge &lt;math&gt;e\in E&lt;/math&gt; is '''incident''' to a vertex &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;v\in f(e)&lt;/math&gt;.

In the above example, 
* V={v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}
* E={e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, e&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;}
* f such that e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; maps to {v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}, e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; maps to {v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}, e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; maps to {v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}, e&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; maps to {v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}, and e&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; maps to {v&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, v&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;}.

If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is not injective — that is, if &lt;math&gt;\exists e,e'\in E&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;e\neq e', f(e) = f(e')&lt;/math&gt; — then we say that &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a '''multigraph''' and we call any such edges &lt;math&gt;e,e'\in E&lt;/math&gt; ''multiple edges''.  Further, we call edges &lt;math&gt;e \in E&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|f(e)|=1&lt;/math&gt; '''loops'''.  Graphs without multiple edges or loops are known as '''simple graphs'''.

Graphs can, conceivably, be infinite as well, and thus we place no bounds on the sets V and E. We will not look at infinite graphs here.

=== Directions, Weights, and Flows ===

We define a '''directed graph''' as a graph such that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; maps into the set of ordered pairs &lt;math&gt;\{(x,y)|x,y\in V\}&lt;/math&gt; rather than into the family of two-element sets &lt;math&gt;\{\{x,y\}|x,y\in V\}&lt;/math&gt;.  We can think of an edge &lt;math&gt;e\in E&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(e)=(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; as 'pointing' from &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  As such we would say that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the ''tail'' of edge &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is the ''head''.  This is one of the vagaries of graph theory notation, though.  We could just as easily think of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as the head and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; as the tail.  To represent a directed graph, we can draw a picture as described and shown above, but place arrows on every edge corresponding to its direction.

In general, a '''weight''' on a graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is some function &lt;math&gt;c: E(G)\rightarrow \mathbb R&lt;/math&gt;.

A '''flow''' &lt;math&gt;(G,c)&lt;/math&gt; is a directed graph &lt;math&gt;G=(V,E,f)&lt;/math&gt; paired with a weight function such that the weight &quot;going into&quot; any vertex is the same amount as the weight &quot;going out&quot; of that vertex.  To make this more formal, define sets
*&lt;math&gt;f^+(v)=\{e\in E(G)|f(e)=(v,x), x\in V(G)\},\; \forall v\in V(G)&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;f^-(v)=\{e\in E(G)|f(e)=(x,v), x\in V(G)\},\; \forall v\in V(G)&lt;/math&gt;
Then, formally stated, our requirement on the weight function is
&lt;math&gt;\sum_{e\in f^+(v)} c(e)=\sum_{e\in f^-(v)} c(e),\; \forall v\in V(G).&lt;/math&gt;

=== Special Graphs ===
[[Image:Completegraphon6vertices.png|thumb|The complete graph on 6 vertices]] 
Some graphs occur frequently enough in graph theory that they deserve special mention.  One such graphs is the ''complete graph'' on n vertices, often denoted by K&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;.  This graph consists of n vertices, with each vertex connected to every other vertex, and every pair of vertices joined by exactly one edge.  Another such graph is the ''cycle graph'' on ''n'' vertices, for ''n'' at least 3.  This graph is denoted C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and defined by V := {1,2,..,n} and E := {{1,2},{2,3}, ..., {n-1,n},{n,1}}.  Even easier is the ''null graph'' on ''n'' vertices, denoted N&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;; it has ''n'' vertices and no edges!  Note that N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

=== Some Terms ===
Two vertices are said to be ''adjacent'' if there is an edge joining them. The word ''incident'' has two meanings:

* An edge ''e'' is said to be incident to a vertex ''v'' if ''v'' is an endpoint of ''e''.
* Two edges are also incident to each other if both are incident to the same vertex.

Two graphs ''G'' and ''H'' are said to be ''isomorphic'' if there is a one-to-one  function from (or, if you prefer, one-to-one correspondence between) the vertex set of ''G'' to the vertex set of ''H'' such that two vertices in ''G'' are adjacent if and only if their images in ''H'' are adjacent. (Technically, the multiplicity of the edges must also be preserved, but our definition suffices for simple graphs.) 

=== Subgraphs ===
[[File:Subgraph.svg|thumb|Generated Subgraphs]]
A ''subgraph'' is a concept akin to the subset. A subgraph has a subset of the vertex set V, a subset of the edge set E, and each edge's endpoints in the larger graph has the same edges in the subgraph. A 

A subgraph &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is ''generated'' by the vertices {&lt;math&gt;a, b, c,...&lt;/math&gt;}&lt;math&gt;\in H&lt;/math&gt; if the edge set of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; consists of all edges in the edge set of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that joins the vertices in &lt;math&gt;H=&lt;/math&gt;{&lt;math&gt;a, b, c, ...&lt;/math&gt;}.

A ''path'' is a sequence of edges &lt;math&gt;&lt;e_1,...,e_N&gt;&lt;/math&gt; such that e&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is adjacent to e&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt; for all i from 1 to N-1. Two vertices are said to be connected if there is a path connecting them. 

&lt;!-- clean this up A connected component of a graph is a maximal subgraph generated by vertices which are all mutually connected. A cycle is a path with the same initial and final vertex. A connected cycleless graph is called a tree. A maximal subgraph of a connected graph which is a tree is called a spanning tree. A planar graph is a graph representable by points on a plane as vertices and nonintersecting continuous curves as edges. --&gt;

== Trees and Bipartite Graphs ==

A ''tree'' is a graph that is (i) connected, and (ii) has no cycles.
Equivalently, a tree is a connected graph with
exactly &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; edges, where there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; nodes in the tree.

A ''Bipartite graph'' is a graph whose nodes can be partitioned into two disjoint
sets U and W such that every edge in the graph is incident to one node in U and one
node in W. A tree is a bipartite graph.

A ''complete bipartite graph'' is a bipartite graph in which each node in U is connected to every node in W;
a complete bipartite graph in which U has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; vertices and V has &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; vertices
is denoted &lt;math&gt;K_{n,m}&lt;/math&gt;.

Adjacent,Incident,End Vertices

Self loops,Parallel edges,Degree of Vertex

Pendant Vertex : Vertex Degree one &quot;Pendant Vertex&quot;
Isolated Vertex : Vertex Degree zero &quot;Isolated Vertex&quot;

== Hamiltonian and Eulerian Paths ==
Hamiltonian Cycles:
A Hamiltonian Cycle received its name from Sir William Hamilton who first studied the travelling salesman problem. A Hamiltonian cycle is a path that visits every vertex once and only once i.e. it is a walk, in which no edge is repeated (a trail) and therefore a trail in which no vertex is repeated (a path). Note also it is a cycle, the last vertex is joined to the first.

A graph is said to be Eulerian if it is possible to traverse each edge once and only once, i.e. it has no odd vertices or it has an even number of odd vertices (semi-Eulerian). This has implications for the Königsberg problem. It may be easier to imagine this as if it is possible to trace the edges of a graph with a pencil without lifting the pencil off the paper or going over any lines.

== Planar Graphs ==

A ''planar graph'' is an undirected graph that can be 
drawn on the plane or on a sphere in such
a way that no two edges cross, 
where an edge &lt;math&gt;e = (u,v)&lt;/math&gt; is drawn as a continuous curve 
(it need not be a straight line) from u to v.

Kuratowski proved a remarkable fact about planar graphs:  A graph is
planar if and only if it does not contain a subgraph homeomorphic to 
&lt;math&gt;K_5&lt;/math&gt; or to &lt;math&gt;K_{3,3}&lt;/math&gt;.
(Two graphs are said to be homeomorphic if we can shrink some components of each
into single nodes and end up with identical graphs.  Informally, this means that
non-planar-ness is caused by only two things—namely, having the structure of
&lt;math&gt;K_5&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;K_{3,3}&lt;/math&gt; within the graph).

=== Coloring Graphs ===
A graph is said to be planner if it can be drawn on a plane in such way that no edges cross one anather except of course of vertices

This is not easy, because some students are taking several classes with finals, and a student can take only one test during a particular time slot. The Schedules Office wants to avoid all conflicts, but to make the exam period as short as possible.

We can recast this scheduling problem as a question about coloring the vertices of a graph. Create a vertex for each course with a final exam. Put an edge between two vertices if some student is taking both courses. For example, the scheduling graph might look like this:
Next, identify each time slot with a color. For example, Monday morning is red, Monday
afternoon is blue, Tuesday morning is green, etc.

Assigning an exam to a time slot is now equivalent to coloring the corresponding vertex.
The main constraint is that adjacent vertices must get different colors; otherwise, some student has two exams at the same time. Furthermore, in order to keep the exam period short, we should try to color all the vertices using as few different colors as possible.
For our example graph, three colors suffice:
red, green, blue.

The coloring corresponds to giving one final on Monday morning (red), two Monday afternoon (blue), and two Tuesday morning (green)...

=== K Coloring ===

Many other resource allocation problems boil down to coloring some graph. In general, a graph G is kcolorable if each vertex can be assigned one of k colors so that adjacent vertices
get different colors. The smallest sufficient number of colors is called the chromatic number of G. The chromatic number of a graph is generally difficult to compute, but the following theorem provides an upper bound:

Theorem 1. A graph with maximum degree at most k is (k + 1)colorable.
----

Proof. We use induction on the number of vertices in the graph, which we denote by n. Let P(n) be the proposition that an nvertex
graph with maximum degree at most k is (k + 1)colorable.
A 1 vertex graph has maximum degree 0 and is 1colorable,
so P(1) is true.

Now assume that P(n) is true, and let G be an (n + 1)vertex
graph with maximum degree at most k. Remove a vertex v, leaving an nvertex
graph G . The maximum degree of G is at most k, and so G is (k + 1)colorable
by our assumption P(n). Now add back vertex v. We can assign v a color different from all adjacent vertices, since v has degree at most k and k + 1 colors are available. Therefore, G is (k + 1)colorable.
The theorem follows by induction.

== Weighted Graphs ==
A '''weighted graph'''  associates a  label (weight) with every edge in the graph. Weights are usually real numbers, and often represent a &quot;cost&quot; associated with the edge, either in terms of the entity that is being modeled, or an optimization problem that is being solved.
