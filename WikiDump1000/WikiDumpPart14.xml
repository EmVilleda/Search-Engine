==Phylum Porifera==
[[Image:Woda-1 ubt.jpeg|thumb|right|Sponges]]
Name means &quot;pore-bearing&quot;.

This phylum consists of the sponges. The number of species is estimated to be between 5,000 and 10,000. All are aquatic and almost all are marine.

Animals in this phyla have no true tissues, which means, for example, that they have no nervous system or sense organs. Although sponges are multicellular, they are described as being essentially at a cellular level of organization. They are sessile as adults, but have a free swimming larva.

Their bodies are porous. They are filter feeders; water flows in through many small openings, and out through fewer, large openings. They have inner and outer cell layers, and a variable middle layer. The middle layer often is gelatinous with spiny skeletal elements (called spicules) of silica or calcium carbonate, and fibres made of spongin (a form of collagen). Choanocytes are flagellated cells lining the inside of the body that generate a current, and trap and phagocytize food particles.

Their cells remain totipotent, or developmentally flexible: they can become any type of cell at any point in the sponge's development. This allows for the great regenerative power sponges have.

Sponges are an ancient group, with fossils from the early Cambrian (ca. 540 mya) and possibly from the Precambrian. Sponges often are abundant in reef ecosystems. They somehow are protected from predators (spicules? bad taste?).

Many organisms are commensals of sponges, living inside them. Some sponges harbor endosymbiotic cyanobacteria or algae (dinoflagellates, a.k.a. &quot;zooxanthellae&quot;).

==[[w:Cnidaria|Phylum Cnidaria]]==  
See text pages 886 - 889.

Name comes from the Greek knide- meaning &quot;nettle&quot;.

This phylum consists of the [[w:Jellyfish|jellyfish]], hydra, [[w:Sea anemone|sea anemones]], [[w:Coral|corals]], sea pens, sea wasps, and box jellyfish. There are abot 9,000 species. Almost are are marine. This is another ancient group, with fossils perhaps reaching back to 700 mya.

Cnidarians exhibit '''radial symmetry'''. Their basic body plan is a sac with a gastrovascular cavity, or a central digestive system. They have one opening, which serves as both mouth and anus. The body wall has an outer ectoderm, an inner endoderm, and a variable undifferentiated middle layer called mesoglea or mesenchyme that may be jelly-like. The mesoglea is NOT considered to be true mesoderm and so the Cnidaria are described as diploblastic. Tentacles usually extend from the body wall around the mouth/anus.
[[Image:Schleiden-meduse.jpg|thumb|right|Jellyfish Development]]
There are two basic body plans: the [[w:polyp|polyp]] and the [[w:Medusa (biology)|medusa]]. The polyp is sessile and attaches to substrate by the aboral end (i.e., the end away from the mouth). The medusa (&quot;jellyfish&quot;) is a floating form, and looks like an upside-down version of the polyp. Some cnidarians only have the polyp stage, some have only the medusa stage, and others have both.

The typical life cycle of a cnidarian involves what is called &quot;alternation of generations&quot;: an alternation between an asexual polyp stage and a sexual medusa stage.

The tentacles are armed with cnidae (or nematocysts), small intracellular &quot;harpoons&quot; that function in defense and prey capture. When fired, the cnidae deliver a powerful toxin that in some cases is dangerous to humans. The phylum is named after the cnidae.

Cnidarians have no head, no centralized nervous system, and no specialized organs for gas exchange, excretion, or circulation. They do have a &quot;nerve net.&quot;

Many cnidarians have intracellular algae living within them in a mutualistic symbiotic relationship (Dinoflagellates = zooxanthellae). This combination is responsible for much of the primary productivity of coral reefs.

There are three main classes in the phylum 

* [[w:Hydrozoa|Class Hydrozoa]] (hydras and Portugese man-of-war are well-known but atypical examples of this Class)
* [[w:Scyphozoa|Class Scyphozoa]] (jellyfish)
** The medusa stage is dominant and the polyp stage often is reduced.
* [[w:Anthozoa|Class Anthozoa]] (sea anemones, most corals)
** No medusa (jellyfish) stage, so sexual reproduction occurs in the polyp stage in this group. The polyps also can reproduce asexually, which is how individual &quot;corals&quot; grow.

==[[w:Platyhelminthes|Phylum Platyhelminthes]]==
See text pages 890 - 893.

Name means &quot;flat worm&quot;

Most members of this phylum are parasitic (flukes and tapeworms), but some are free living (e.g., planaria). There are about 20,000 species.

They are dorsoventrally compressed (i.e., &quot;flat&quot;).  

Animals in this phylum are acoelomate, triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unsegmented. Platyhelminths have a simple anterior &quot;brain&quot; and a simple ladder-like nervous system. Their gut has only one opening. Flatworms have NO circulatory or gas exchange systems. They do have simple excretory/osmoregulatory structures (protonephridia or &quot;flame cells&quot;).

Platyhelminths are hermaphroditic, and the parasitic species often have VERY complex reproductive (life) cycles.

There are four main classes of platyhelminths:

* [[w:Turbellaria|Class Turbellaria]] (mostly free living flatworms, e.g., planaria)
* [[w:Monogenea|Class Monogenea]] (parasitic flukes)
* [[w:Trematoda|Class Trematoda]] (parasitic flukes, e.g., liver fluke and the human blood fluke, Schistosoma)
* [[w:Cestoda|Class Cestoda]] (tapeworms)
** Cestodes are endoparasitic in the gut of vertebrates. They do not have a mouth or digestive system.

==[[w:Rotifer|Phylum Rotifera]]==  
See text page 900

The Rotifers. The name means &quot;wheel bearing,&quot; a reference to the corona, a feeding structure (see below).

They are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, and unsegmented. They are considered pseudocoelomates.

Most less than 2 mm, some as large as 2 - 3 mm.

Rotifers have a three part body: head, trunk foot. The head has a ciliary organ called the corona that, when beating, looks like wheels turning, hence the name of the phylum. The corona is a feeding structure that surrounds the animal's jaws. The gut is complete (i.e., mouth &amp; anus), and regionally specialized. They have protonephridia but no specialized circulatory or gas-exchange structures.

Most live in fresh water, a very few are marine or live in damp terrestrial habitats. They typically are very abundant. There are about 2,000 species.

Parthenogenesis, where females produce more females from unfertilized but diploid eggs, is common. Males may be absent (as in bdelloid rotifers) or reduced. When males are present, sexual and asexual life cycles alternate. Males develop from unfertilized haploid eggs and are haploid. Males produce sperm by mitosis which can fertilize haploid eggs, yielding a diploid zygote that develops into a diploid female. Sexual reproduction occurs primarily when living conditions are unfavorable.

Most structures in rotifers are syncytial (&quot;a mulitnucleate mass of protoplasm not divided into separate cells,&quot; or &quot;a multinucleated cell&quot;) and show eutely (here, &quot;constant or near-constant number of nuclei&quot;).

==Phylum Nematoda == 
See text pages 894 - 895.

Name from the Greek for &quot;thread&quot;.

This phylum consists of the round worms. There are about 12,000 named species but the true number probably is 10 - 100 times this!

These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, unsegmented pseudocoelomates. They are vermiform, or wormlike.

In cross-section, they are round, and covered by a layered cuticle (remember this cuticle !!). Probably due to this cuticle, juveniles in this phylum grow by molting. The gut is complete. They have a unique excretory system but they lack special circulatory or gas-exchange structures. The body has only longitudinal muscle fibers. The sexes are separate.

Nematodes can be incredibly common, widespread, and of great medical and economic importance. They are parasites of humans and our crops. They can live pretty much anywhere.
: In one rotting apple, there can be up to 90,000 nematodes, and in one tablespoon of coastal mud, there can be 236 species of nematodes!

Nematodes can be free living or important parasites of our crops, or of humans and other animals. They have become very important in development studies, especially the species Caenorhabditis elegans, presumably due to its small size and constancy of cell number (eutely - 959 cells in C. elegans).

==Phylum Annelida==
See text pages 906 - 909.

Name means &quot;ringed&quot;, from the Greek annulatus.

This phylum consists of earthworms, leeches, and various marine worms given many different names (e.g., sand worms, tube worms). There are about 12,000 - 15,000 species.

Animals in this phylum are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented coelomates. Development is typically protostomous. They have a complete circulatory system, and a well-developed nervous system. Typically, each segment has paired epidermal &quot;bristles&quot; (setae or chaetae).

Most are marine but they are successful occupants of almost anywhere sufficient water is available. They can be free living, parasitic, mutualistic, or commensalistic.

Major advances of this phylum include the true coelom, segmentation, both longitundinal and circular muscles, a closed circulatory system and, for most, a more advanced excretory system (metanephridia).

There are three main classes of Annelids

* Class Oligochaeta (earthworms)
* Class Polychaeta (marine worms)
* Class Hirudinea (leeches)

==Phylum Arthropoda==
[[Image:Arthro_characters.jpeg|thumb|right|Arthropods]]

Name means &quot;jointed feet&quot;.

This phylum consists of spiders, ticks, mites, insects, lobsters, crabs, and shrimp, and is the largest of all the phyla. So far, over 1 million species have been named, and it is likely that the true number out there is 10 - 100 times greater.
: This phylum also includes the extinct trilobites, which were prevalent in the Paleozoic era. Because of their exoskeletons, these animals fossilized well and over 4000 species have been named.

These animals are triploblastic, bilaterally symmetrical, segmented, protostome coelomates. The coelom is generally reduced to portions of the reproductive and excretory systems. They have an open circulatory system.

The most notable advancement of this phylum is a rigid exoskeleton. It has major implications in these organisms' locomotion, flexibility, circulatory systems, gas exchange systems, and growth. It also was partially responsible for the ability of the arthropods to move on to land.

There are several major groupings of arthropods:
: Major subgroups include:
:* The chelicerates (eurytperids, horseshoe crabs, scorpions, spiders, ticks) have clawlike feeding appendages. They lack antennae and usually have simple eyes.
:* The Trilobites...they get their own grouping
:* The uniramians (centipedes, millipedes, insects) have one pair of antennae and unbranched (uniramous) appendages.
:* The crustaceans (crabs, shrimp, lobsters, barnacles and many others) have two pairs of antennae and branched (biramous) appendages.
: Major Classes Include  
:* Class Arachnida (mites, scorpions, spiders, ticks)
:* Class Diplopoda (millipedes)
:* Class Chilopoda (centipedes)
:* Class Insecta (insects)
:* Class Crustacea (crabs, crayfish, lobsters, shrimp)

==Phylum Mollusca==
See text pages 900 - 905.

Name means &quot;soft&quot;.

This phylum consists of snails, slugs, bivalves, chitons, squids, octopus, and many others. About 110,000 species

All molluscs have a similar body plan: 

* A muscular foot, usually used for movement.
* A visceral mass, containing most of the internal organs.
* A mantle, a fold of tissue that drapes over the visceral mass and secretes the shell, if present.
* Most have a radula, or a rasping organ to scrape food.

Molluscs are bilaterally symmetrical, or secondarily asymmetrical. They are coelomates, but the coelom generally has been greatly reduced; the main body cavity is a hemocoel. Development is typically protostomous. The gut is complete with marked regional specialization. Large, complex, metanephridia (excretion).

Many molluscan life cycles include a trochophore larva. This stage also is characteristic of annelids.

There are several major classes of molluscs:

* Class Polyplacophora (chitons)
* Class Gastropoda (snails, slugs, nudibranchs)
* Class Bivalvia (clams, mussels, scallops, oysters)
* Class Cephalopoda (squids, octopuses, chambered nautiluses)
* Class Scaphopoda (tusk shells)

==Phylum Echinodermata==
Name means &quot;spiny skin&quot;

This phylum consists of sea stars, brittle stars, sea urchins, and sea cucumbers.

Echinoderms are mostly sessile or very slow moving animals.

As adults, they are radially symmetrical, but in the larval stage, they are bilaterally symmetrical. They are considered deuterostomes.

Echinoderms are unique in that they have a water vascular system composed of a system of fluid-filled canals. These canals branch into the tube feet, which function in feeding, locomotion, and gas exchange.

There are six major classes of echinoderms:

* Class Asteroidea (sea stars)
* Class Ophiuroidea (brittle stars)
* Class Echinoidea (sea urchins, sand dollars)
* Class Crinoidea (sea lilies)
* Class Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers)

==Phylum Chordata==
Name means &quot;the chordates&quot;, i.e., these animals have a notochord at some stage in their lifecycle.

This phylum consists of tunicates, lancelets, and the vertebrates.

There are four major features that characterize the phylum Chordata.

* A notochord, or a longitudinal, flexible rod between the digestive tube and the nerve cord. In most vertebrates, it is replaced developmentally by the vertebral column. This is the structure for which the phylum is named.
* A dorsal hollow nerve cord which develops from a plate of ectoderm that rolls into a tube located dorsal to the notochord. Other animal phyla have solid nerve cords ventrally located. A chordate nerve cord splits into the central nervous system: the brain and spinal cord.
* Pharyngeal slits, which allow water that enters through the mouth to exit without continuing through the entire digestive tract. In many of the invertebrate chordates, these function as suspension feeding devices; in vertebrates, they have been modified for gas exchange, jaw support, hearing, and other functions.
* A muscular, postanal tail which extends posterior to the anus. The digestive tract of most nonchordates extends the length of the body. In chordates, the tail has skeletal elements and musculature, and can provide most of the propulsion in aquatic species.

Chordates have a segmented body plan, at least in development. This segmentation evolved independently from the segmentation of annelids.

Three subphyla make up the phylum Chordata:

* Subphylum Urochordata (tunicates): the adults are enclosed in a tunic made of a carbohydrate much like cellulose. They squirt water out of an excurrent siphon. Urochordates are characterized by errant (mobile and active) larvae and sessile adults. All are filter feeders. The only &quot;chordate&quot; characteristics retained in adult life are the pharyngeal slits. Larval urochordates look more like adult cephlochordates &amp; adult vertebrates than adult urochordates.
* Subphylum Cephalochordata: Cephalochordates are known as lancelets because of their blade-like shape; they are also known as amphioxus. They are marine animals and usually live on the bottom, but can swim.
* Subphylum Vertebrata (vertebrates) ...

Formally, the phyla Urochordata and Cephalochordata are considered invertebrates.  

===Subphylum Vertebrata===
Vertebrata refers to the presence of vertebrae and a vertebral column.

This subphylum includes most of the animals with which most people are familiar.
: Vertebrates show extreme cephalization.

The notochord generally is replaced by the cranium &amp; vertebral column in adults.

====Neural Crest Cells====
Later in development, these give rise to many cells of the body, including some cartilage cells, pigment cells, neurons &amp; glial cells of the peripheral nervous systems, much of the cranium, and some of the cells of the endocrine system.

Some scientists would like to classify the neural crest as the fourth germ layer.

Neural crest cells come from the dorsal edge of the neural plate, thus ectoderm.</text>

== Key Terms ==

synapomorphy


== Introduction ==

What makes an animal an animal?  

If animals are a monophyletic taxon, then animals should be able to be defined by synapomorphies, (shared, derived characteristics). Ideally, we would NOT define this or any taxon using symplesiomorphies (shared ancestral or primitive characteristics) or homoplastic characters (the independent evolution of similarity, or &quot;convergent evolution&quot;). See pages 654 - 656 and Fig. 32.6 in your text to review these concepts. As you consider the characteristics listed below, ask yourself whether or not each is a synapomorphy.


== Characteristics of an Animal ==


* There is no one universally accepted definition of an animal. The following treatment follows your text, beginning on page 876.
** Animals:
*** Are multicellular, heterotrophic eukaryotes &amp;hellip;
*** Lack the distinctive cell walls of plants &amp; fungi
*** Share unique characteristics &amp;hellip;
*** Share certain reproductive characteristics &amp;hellip;
*** Other commonly used definitions &amp;hellip;

Animals are multicellular heterotrophic eukaryotes 
* Unfortunately, none of these traits is exclusive to animals: 
** Plants, fungi, and some algae are multicellular.
** Many bacteria, protists, and all fungi are heterotrophic. 
** Everything other than bacteria and archaea are eukaryotic.
* Moreover, all three of these characteristics also apply to fungi. 
** However, there is a difference here between animals and fungi. Animals generally take in their food through ingestion, or eating and swallowing something. Fungi are absorptive heterotrophs; they secrete their digestive enzymes onto their food, and then absorb the resulting nutrients.

Animals share unique characteristics
* Only animals have muscle tissue and nervous tissue.
* Only animals have collagen, a structural protein
* Only animals have the following types of intercellular junctions: (See pages 135 - 139, Figure 7.15 in your text for more information on these junctions.)
** Tight junctions (sealing function)
** Desmosomes (anchoring function)
** Gap junctions (communication function)

Animals share certain reproductive characteristics  
* Most animals reproduce sexually, with the diploid stage dominating.
* In most animals, a small, haploid, flagellated, motile sperm fertilizes a larger, haploid, nonmotile egg to form a diploid zygote.
* Mitotic division of the zygote yields a blastula stage, followed by a gastrula stage. A synapomorphy? This feature could be another &quot;unique characteristic&quot; shared by animals.
* Development may be direct to adult form, or there may be a sexually immature stage (or stages) that are morphologically &amp; ecologically distinct from the adult called a larva (plural: larvae).

Other commonly used definitions or characterizations
* It is surprisingly difficult to find two texts that agree on a precise definition of an animal. Here are a few perspectives from some other texts.
** Animals are multicellular eukaryotes; they are chemosynthetic heterotrophs that ingest their food.
** Animals are motile, though many are secondarily sessile. Gametes usually are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the zygote passes through embryonic stages that include a blastula.
** Animals are organisms that are multicellular, with more than one type of cell. They are heterotrophic. They reproduce sexually (at least sometimes), with a zygote formed from two different haploid gametes. They go through a developmental stage called a blastula.
** Animals are not photosynthetic, have no cell wall, and no hyphae or mycelia. (What would a cladist think of this definition of the taxon Animalia?)

What kinds of animals are there?  
* Kingdom Animalia generally is recognized to have approximately 30 phyla ...
** There is relatively little dispute over the number of phyla recognized; however, the phylogenetic relationships among the phyla are hotly debated.
** Molecular techniques for assess similarity based on nucleotide sequences in nucleic acids are providing valuable new perspectives on this question.
* Remember that two animals in different phyla generally are considered to be more different from each other than are animals within one phylum (e.g., nematodes are more different from annelids than humans are from sharks).

==The Evolutionary Tree in Animals==

There are many competing hypotheses for the form of the evolutionary tree of animals. A traditional hypothesis is that the tree resembles a tuning fork: it has a short base and two main branches. However, there is recent molecular evidence that challenges part of this traditional hypothesis.

Under the tuning fork model, the &quot;base&quot; of the tree includes structurally simple animals like sponges, corals, and their relatives.

One main branch includes [[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Arthropoda|arthropods]], [[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Mollusca|molluscs]], [[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Annelida|annelids]], and [[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Nematoda|nematodes]]. This branch, or a large part of it, usually is called the '''protostomes'''.

The second main branch includes vertebrates ([[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Chordata|phylum Chordata]]), and starfish, sea urchins, and their relatives ([[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Echinodermata|phylum Echinodermata]]). This branch usually is called the '''deuterostomes'''.

Flatworms ([[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Platyhelminthes|phylum Platyhelminthes]]), which include free living planarians as well as parasitic flukes and tapeworms may be placed very low on the protostome branch, or high on the trunk just below the protostome - deuterostome branching.

==Support for the &quot;Tuning Fork&quot; Model==

The features of animals that have been interpreted as suggesting a tuning fork model are extremely basic characteristics of body organization and early embryonic development.  

===Body Symmetry===

====Asymmetry====

Lack of any symmetry. Many sponges are asymmetric.

====Bilateral Symmetry====

There is only one plane of symmetry, and it is anterior-to-posterior, dorsal-to-ventral, through the midline.

Characteristic of most protostomes and the higher deuterostomes.

===Presence of True Tissues===

Tissues are defined as an integrated group of cells that share a common structure and a common function (for example, nervous tissue or muscle tissue).

Sponges are described as lacking true tissues.

True tissues are present in [[General Biology/Classification of Living Things/Eukaryotes/Animals/Phyla#Phylum_Cnidaria|Cnidaria]], flatworms, and all higher animals.

===Number of Embryonic Germ Layers===

Germ layers are defined as the basic tissue layers in the early embryo which give rise developmentally to the organs and tissues of the adult (e.g., ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm).

This is a concept that is applied ''only'' to organisms considered to have true tissues.

====Two Germ Layers====

Organisms with two germ layers are said to be '''diploblastic'''.

This is characteristic of Cnidarians. 

====Three Germ Layers====

Such organisms are said to be triploblastic.

This is characteristic of flatworms and all higher organisms.

====Four Germ Layers (?)====

Some developmental biologists consider the neural crest tissue of vertebrate embryos to be a fourth germ layer.

===Nature of the Main Body Cavity===

Most triploblastic animals have a fluid-filled space somewhere between the body wall and the gut. Such a cavity can provide numerous functional advantages.

For example, peristalsis of the gut need not affect the body wall, and movements of the body wall during locomotion need not distort the internal organs.

We will consider three conditions with respect to the body cavity:

====Acoelomates====

These animals lack an enclosed body cavity; the only &quot;body cavity&quot; is the lumen of the digestive tube.

The space between the gut and the body wall is filled with a more or less solid mass of mesodermal tissue.

The major example of this is the phylum Platyhelminthes, the flatworms. Minor examples: Phylum Nemertea (Rhynchocoela) and Phylum Gnathostomulida (not responsible for these &quot;minor&quot; examples).

====Pseudocoelomates====

Pseudocoelomates have a fluid-filled cavity between the body wall and the gut, but it does not form within mesoderm, nor does it end up fully enclosed by mesoderm.

This cavity often is interpreted as being a developmental remnant of the blastocoel, the fluid-filled cavity of the blastua stage of the embryo.

To distinguish it from the next grade, this type of cavity is called a pseudocoelom.

Major examples of pseudocoelomates include the phyla Nematoda (round worms) and Rotifera (rotifers). Other phyla listed in the table that are considered to be pseudocoelomates are flagged with an asterisk. Note that recent molecular data in particular have challenged the &quot;naturalness&quot; of the pseudocoelomates as a possible taxon.

====Coelomates====

Coelomate animals also have a fluid-filled cavity between the body wall and the gut.

In this grade, however, the cavity is completely enclosed by mesoderm.

Major examples of coelomates include molluscs, arthropods, echinoderms, and chordates.

=== The protostome-deuterostome distinction ===
The distinction is based on several fundamental characteristics of early development.

'''Characteristic:'''
*Protostomes
*Deuterostomes

'''Determinate vs. indeterminate cleavage'''
*Determinate
*Indeterminate

'''Spiral vs. radial cleavage'''
*Spiral
*Radial

'''Fate of the blastopore'''
*Mouth
*Anus

'''Source of mesoderm'''
*Lip of blastopore
*Wall of archenteron

'''Formation of coelom'''
*Schizocoely
*Enterocoely 

'''Phyla'''
*Mollusca, Annelida, Arthropoda
* Roundworms &amp; flatworms, although non-coelomate, demonstrate other protostome features, and so are included in this group by some authorities.
Echinodermata, Hemichordata, Chordata

'''''[[w:SQL|Structured Query Language (SQL)]]''''' is a widely-used programming language for working with relational databases. The name of the language is generally pronounced as the three letters of its abbreviation [{{IPA|ˈɛs kjuː ˈɛl}}] or, in some people's usage, as [{{IPA|ˈsiːkwəl}}].

This Wikibook provides a short description of SQL, its origins, basic concepts and components, and a lot of examples. The book follows the specifications of the [[w:SQL:2011|SQL:2011]] standard, which is developed by a common committee of [[w:International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] and [[w:International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]. Their publications are not freely available, but can be ordered online. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=53682| title = ISO/IEC 9075-2:2011: Information technology -- Database languages -- SQL -- Part 2: Foundation (SQL/Foundation) }}&lt;/ref&gt; Or you may want to refer to a working draft of [[w:SQL:2008|SQL:2008]], which you can [http://www.wiscorp.com/sql200n.zip download] from Whitemarsh Information Systems Corporation.

Hello,&lt;br&gt;
As a previous contributor to Chess topics, I'd like inform you of the creation of a new project called [[Wikibooks:Chess]]&lt;br&gt; 
Recently this project page has been created and it is hoped that you will join.&lt;br&gt;
To overcome issues of communicating, the project has it's own central page and talk area along with navigation system of useful pages and many new features to make communication among users much slicker and easier, including a [[Special:RecentChangesLinked/List_of_chess_topics|public chess watchlist]]. No need to have your own watchlist anymore, one click and you can see all recent Chess edits!&lt;br&gt;
Also added recently is a new opening navigator(See below), a chess diagram upgrade(looks nice), and a chess stub category. All the [[Opening theory in chess]] pages now have this built in, that's over 500 pages upgraded.&lt;br&gt;

Hope to hear from you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{diet}}

The [[w:Robert Atkins (nutritionist)|Atkins]] diet is a diet in which one eats a low level of carbohydrates and larger amounts of protein, including meats, poultry, and fish.  Dieters avoid simple carbohydrates (refined sugar and starch (ie.flour) as well as most forms of sugar, starches (including starchy vegetables like potatoes), milk (but not cream or cheese), and grains (including most breads).  During the initial 'induction' phase, during which the dieter is limited to no more than 20 net carbohydrates per day, there is a long list of vegetables that are generally felt to be too high in carbohydrates for the Atkins diet, including sweetcorn, peas, potato and others. Some people include carrots in their list of no-nos. However, green beans and many other vegetables such as asparagus, cabbage, broccoli, lettuce, courgettes/zucchini, aubergines/eggplant are OK and encouraged within the Atkins diet, even during the early stages.

Net carbohydrates are defined as total carbohydrates minus fiber content and sugar alcohols.  It is net carbohydrates that are monitored by those practising the Atkins way of life.  In fact, one of the first goals of Atkins is to discover your unique CCL, or Critical Carbohydrate Level.  This number is simply the number of net carbs that can be eaten daily to maintain a fixed weight.  There are four phases to Atkins: 

# Induction
# Ongoing Weight Loss
# Pre-Maintenance
# Lifetime Maintenance

As one moves through the four phases, more variety in food types can be added to the diet, including some breads, fruit, etc. that are considered taboo during the very early stages.

Artificial sweeteners are generally used instead of sugar, and Atkins recipes have high levels of protein. Fat is not avoided. A typical Atkins-approved dessert might be fresh berries served with heavy cream mixed with splenda.

It should be noted that while Atkins works well for short-term weight loss for many people, its long term side effects are continually debated.  Therefore, one would be wise to do research and consult a doctor before beginning this diet.  Thereafter, your doctor will be able to advise you as to the frequency of additional physical check-ups.

The following recipes were created for the Atkins diet or are otherwise acceptable on it:

*[[Cookbook:Atkins-friendly Tira Misu|Atkins-friendly Tira Misu]]
*[[Cookbook:Atkins-friendly Chocolate Mousse|Atkins-friendly Chocolate Mousse]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">My knowledge about the Atkins diet is only cursory but does it really contain '''no''' (== 0) carbohydrates. I doubt it. I suppose it is rather a low carbohydrate high fat and diet. [[w:Atkins Nutritional Approach]]
&lt;br&gt;[[User:Kpjas|Kpjas]] 18:26 7 Aug 2003 (UTC)
:No, in fact it doesn't. The &quot;Atkins Diet&quot; described in this writeup is referring to the first phase of the diet, &quot;Induction&quot;. Despite popular hearsay, Induction is not the entire Atkins program; it is but a two-week program for beginning the Atkins diet. Also, the limit is 20 grams of carbohydrates a day. The limit increases to each person's needs over the course of the program.--[[User:66.24.4.236|66.24.4.236]] 06:31, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)
:It's generally impossible to consume a no-carb diet due to the presence of 'incidental' carbohydrates - the lactose in milk and even cream products, for instance (however, there is considerably less in higher-fat creams (table, whipping, etc) per serving and some preferentially consume these). Even animal tissue has SOME carbs in the form of residual glycogen but it is negligible. Generally the only way you're going to achieve a true no-carb diet is by going on a traditional arctic Inuit style diet.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">About Internet: I don't know how much work or how far your thoughts have gone in starting this book. My thought is to move (retitle it) to ''Using the Internet'' and tighten the scope a bit in that direction. Of ourse, you DO need an outline of the technology involved, so it would be embedded. What do you think? ...[[User:LouI|LouI]] 05:39 8 Aug 2003 (UTC)


: What I was invisioning for the book was to cover a more &quot;behind the scenes of the internet&quot; type content, whereas a ''Using the Internet'' would really only need to cover it from a user points view. Perhaps it might make more sense to have two books, one aimed at the novice/beginner level which just explains how to use email/usenet/irc/etc, and one aimed at the intermediate level user who already knows how to use the internet and now wants to know how it works. We could use the books to complement each other (i.e. in the Internet Technologies book we could have say a short introduction to usenet which says for more information about how to use Usenet see chapter X in ''Using the Internet''.) --[[User:Imran|Imran]] 13:23 8 Aug 2003 (UTC)

: Following that thought, I'd reach for three interrelated books: ''Surfing the Internet'', ''Using the Internet'', and ''Understanding the Internet'' (even though the last is an impossible stretch ;-) and perhaps should be ''Working with the Internet''). Of course, eventually you get a lot of specific technology books, addressing subjects like CSS/HTML/ASP etc. Another way to look at this might split it different ways: ''Introduction to Internet Technology'', ''Introduction to Internet in Business'', and ''Intro to Internet Personal Uses''. The field is so large I don't know how to crack it. How do you address prop-heads, suits, and geeks at the same time? For a third view, you can look at Internet components, contents, and uses separately. Sorry to ramble, but I'm trying to hit various combinations to see if one emerges as obvious. [[User:LouI|LouI]] 18:21 9 Aug 2003 (UTC)

::Splitting it into Surfing the Internet, Using the Internet, and Understanding the Internet seems like a good idea. I don't think splitting it into usages (personal, business,etc.) would be effective because of overlap between the two. --[[User:Imran|Imran]]

'''''&lt;u&gt;This page is for an elementary explanation of the origins and nature of the religions.  It is not meant to be an in depth study by any means.&lt;/u&gt;'''''

==Animism==
Animism (from Latin animus, -i &quot;soul, life&quot;) is the worldview that non-human entities (animals, plants, and inanimate objects or phenomena), possess a spiritual essence.

==Baha'i Faith==
The ''Bahá'í Faith'' is the youngest of the world's independent religions. Its founder, [[wikipedia:Baha'u'llah|Bahá'u'lláh]]  (1817–1892), is regarded by Bahá'ís as the most recent in the line of [[wikipedia:Manifestations of God|Messengers of God]] that stretches back beyond recorded time and that includes Abraham, Moses, Buddha, Zoroaster, Christ and Muhammad.

The central theme of Bahá'u'lláh's message is that humanity is one single race and that the day has come for its unification in one global society. God, Bahá'u'lláh said, has set in motion historical forces that are breaking down traditional barriers of race, class, creed, and nation and that will, in time, give birth to a universal civilization. The principal challenge facing the peoples of the earth is to accept the fact of their oneness and to assist the processes of unification. [http://www.bahai.org/faq/facts/bahai_faith]

Wikipedia article: [[wikipedia:Baha'i Faith|Bahá'í Faith]]

==Buddhism==
Buddhism is a religion based largely around the teachings of the Siddhārtha Gautama (although his exact status is still controversial and changes by sect), and is now the central religion of most of Southeast Asia, Mongolia, Sri Lanka, and parts of China, India, and a small part of Russia. It is also a major religion in Korea and Japan, and has growing influence in the west.

Gautama was born in ancient Nepal around the 6th century BC, son of a King and relieved of all tasks. One day, while being brought around by his charioteer, he saw the four passing sights (an old man, a sickly man, a decaying corpse, and a holy man), which brought him to the realization that birth, old age, sickness, and death happen to all people over countless lives. He left his wife, children, rank, and his entire life to solve that problem.
Gautama tried everything to achieve inner peace (he nearly killed himself numerous times), but found nothing that worked. He then tried sitting peacefully under a Bohdi tree and meditating. This proved very successful, and he soon achieved the inner peace he wanted. He then traveled the lands, preaching his new faith.(Postscript-Buddhism is largely based on Jainism, and shares many beliefs with Jainism.)

Within the context of postclassical China, dominations such as pure land and Zen Buddhism appealed to both aristocratic elites and the mass peasantry. A commonality of religion in the global context: the induction of fervent belief system in the presence of societal corruption and lack of intellectual synthesis.

Modern Buddhism still follows the ideals of Gautama-peace, kindness to man, and love of nature (including vegetarianism). There are three modern sects of Buddhism - Theravada, Mahāyāna, and Vajrayāna (practiced in southeast Asia, East Asia, and scattered parts of Asia, respectively).

For information on the sects of Buddhism, or some tenents of Buddhism, go to:

==Christianity==

==Confucianism==

==Hinduism==
''Hinduism'' is a term coined to designate the traditional socio-religious systems of the people of India. This term does not appear in any of the sacred literature of India. Hindus refer to their religion as ''Sanatana Dharma'' which loosely translated means “The Eternal Path”. ''Sanatana'' means ''eternal'', ''perpetual'' or ''sustained''. ''Dharma'' means any method by which one sees reality for what it is, and that by which one is drawn closer to the Absolute Truth and Ultimate Reality — it is the ''Philosophia Perenis''.

In a context of world history, the Hindu emphasis placed upon social divisions as ample means for a productive society led to the highly stratified caste system in which birth and socio-economic position determined semi-permanent placement. 

There are two world religions which have formed the cultural and ethical basis of the world as we know it. Both have an unbroken history going back thousands of years. Judaism with a 5000 year old tradition is the mother of the western civilisation through its offshoot Christianity. Hinduism is the older of the two with a literature going back to the beginning of recorded history. 

Hindu civilisation originated in the Gangetic and Indus valleys and from there spread out over the entire region of southeast Asia. Its offshoot — Buddhism, shaped and molded the civilizations of Japan, China, Tibet and the rest of Asia. There is evidence to suggest that the Ancient pre-Biblical kingdom of the Mittani in Asia minor was ruled by Kings with Hindu/Sanskrit names. The Hittites were an Indo-European people and according to some sources are said to have originated in the Gangetic Basin of India. Hindu philosophy/theology influenced the ancient Greeks since the time Alexander the Great conquered parts of north India. A remarkable similarity has also been demonstrated between the religion and mythology of the ancient Scandinavian people and that of the people of India. 

The ancient civilizations such as the Roman, Greek, Egyptian, Sumerian, Babylonian, Mayan, Aztec, and Inca have all passed away. Even the Jewish culture has undergone many radical changes since its inception 5000 years ago – yet the Hindu civilisation continues as a vibrant and living vector, and has remained virtually unchanged for over 6000 years. Today, Hindu communities are to be found in almost every country on earth.

====10.2 Students compare and contrast the '''Glorious Revolution of England''', the '''American Revolution''', and the '''French Revolution''' and their enduring effects worldwide on the political expectations for '''self-government and individual liberty'''.==== 

1. Compare the major ideas of philosophers and their effects on the '''democratic revolutions''' in England, the United States, France, and Latin America (e.g., John Locke, Charles-Louis Montesquieu, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, Simón Bolívar, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison). 

2. List the principles of the Magna Carta, the English Bill of Rights (1689), the American Declaration of Independence (1776), the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen (1789), and the U.S. Bill of Rights (1791). 

3. Understand the unique character of the '''American Revolution''', its spread to other parts of the world, and its continuing significance to other nations. 

4. Explain how the ideology of the '''French Revolution''' led France to develop from constitutional monarchy to democratic despotism to the Napoleonic empire. 

5. Discuss how '''nationalism''' spread across Europe with Napoleon but was repressed for a generation under the Congress of Vienna and Concert of Europe until the Revolutions of 1848.

== Objectives ==
'''10.3 Students analyze the effects of the '''Industrial Revolution''' in England, France, Germany, Japan, and the United States.'''

1. Analyze why England was the first country to industrialize.

2. Examine how '''scientific and technological changes''' and new forms of energy brought about massive social, economic, and cultural change (e.g., the inventions and discoveries of James Watt, Eli Whitney, Henry Bessemer, Louis Pasteur, Thomas Edison).
 
3. Describe the growth of '''population''', rural to urban migration, and growth of cities associated with the Industrial Revolution. 

4. Trace the evolution of '''work and labor,''' including the demise of the slave trade and the effects of immigration, mining and manufacturing, division of labor, and the union movement. 

5. Understand the connections among natural resources, entrepreneurship, labor, and capital in an industrial economy. 

6. Analyze the emergence of '''capitalism''' as a dominant economic pattern and the responses to it, including Utopianism, Social Democracy, Socialism, and Communism. 

7. Describe the emergence of '''Romanticism''' in art and literature (e.g., the poetry of William Blake and William Wordsworth), social criticism (e.g., the novels of Charles Dickens), and the move away from Classicism in Europe.

==The Industrial Revolution==

In 1750, most people in Europe lived on small farms and produced most of their needs by hand. By the middle of the 19th century, many people lived in cities and most of their needs were produced by complex machines using steam power. The Industrial Revolution began in Great Britain and spread to Belgium, France, Germany, the United States and Japan. It was a fundamental change in the way goods were produced, and altered the way people lived. The Industrial Revolution is a major turning point in world history. 

===Why Great Britain?===

Great Britain became the focus of the Industrial Revolution for a variety of reasons: the start of the Agrarian Revolution, an abundance of natural resources, available capital, and the political will to support innovation.

The Agrarian Revolution was a change in farming methods that allowed for a greater production of food. This revolution was fueled by the use of new farming technology such as the seed drill and improved fertilizers. The results of this revolution in farming was a population explosion due to the higher availability of food. Also, the Enclosure Movement, which was the consolidation of many small farms into one large farm, left many people jobless and homeless. These people provided the workforce of the Industrial Revolution. 

Great Britain's geography provides them with an abundance of the natural resources needed for industrialization, such as iron ore and coal. Britain also had access to many navigable rivers and natural harbors which provided for the easy movement of goods both within the country, and overseas. The British overseas empire provided them with a strong economy, this produced the capital (money) needed to build railroads, factories, and mines. 

Politically, British entrepreneurs enjoyed a high degree of freedom from state control, compared to their counterparts in France, Russia and other parts of Europe.  A relatively fair court system existed to enforce contracts and settle disputes among capital owners.  These factors may have allowed new technologies and energy resources to take root and flourish. Britain experienced a revolution in energy use as they switched from animal power, to water power, to steam power in a few short years. The steam engine was the power source of the Industrial Revolution.

==Effects==


===Philosophy=== 

The philosophy of Communism appeared as a reaction to the condition of the Working Class in industrial society. Karl Marx wrote in The Communist Manifesto (1848) that all of human history is based on the conflict between the bourgeoisie (those who control the means of production) and the proletariat (working class). He predicted that the proletariat would rise up in a violent revolution to overthrow the bourgeoisie and create a society with an equal distribution of goods and services. This socialist theory would form the basis for the Bolshevik, Chinese, and Cuban Revolutions in the 20th Century. The United States had a very strong reaction to him.

===Imperialism===

Due to the need for raw materials and new markets, the industrialized nations took control of Africa, India, South East Asia, and others. Imperialism had a negative effect on most of these cultures, and did not completely end until after World War II. Most of the benefits of imperialism accrued to the European nations.

The Industrial Revolution was a major turning point in world history as it resulted in a complete change in society on all levels. Effects of the Industrial Revolutions were long reaching, and influenced many other cultures both positively and negatively.

== Before the Great War ==

=== Factors Leading to War ===

Constant colonial tensions among the great powers had given rise to the possibility of a great war between the major European powers.  For almost a hundred years, since the fall of Napoleon, a remarkable series of events kept the relative peace.  But as 1914 approached, tensions began to rise in a number of countries, and key issues began to take their toll. 

==== The Changing of Imperialism ====

By 1914, Imperialism had begun to come at last to a turning point.  The massive land grabs that had divided up Africa, given Britain such a huge empire, and led to the collapse of the Chinese Empire had finally run their course.  There simply were very few places left on Earth containing massive amounts of land not already claimed by a western power.  This was especially bad news to nations that were latecomers to the game of Imperialism, Germany and, to a lesser extent, Russia.

Wilhelm II did not wish for Germany to miss out on the benefits of a colonial empire. Germany already had some territories in Africa, and after the Berlin Conference of 1885, they were major policy makers on the continent.  However, Wilhelm II continually pushed for a larger role for Germany in Africa, leading ultimately to the Morocco Affair, and a heightening of tension.

==== Turmoil in Russia====

Russia was also undergoing immense changes.  After three hundred years of Romanov rule, Russia was finally making a transition to a modern nation.  However, the Romanov tsar, Nicholas II of Russia , was still clinging onto a good measure of authoritarian power.  The struggle between Nicholas II and reform-minded progressives would eventually lead to the drama of the Russian Revolution.

To make a bad situation worse, Russia was also in a bad geographic situation.  Despite being the largest European power in terms of land area of their home nation, Russia was mostly poor and un-industrialized.  Much of the nation was underdeveloped, and only slowly inching its way toward a more profitable existence.  At the same time, Russia was dealing with an unfavorable political situation, already reeling from the loss of the Russo-Japanese War, as well as attempting to stay afoot of the fast-paced diplomacy of the west.

==== The Sick Man of Europe ====

For several hundred years, the Ottoman Empire had been slowly collapsing under its own weight, watching helplessly as first one province and then another had broken away, or been stolen.  Recently, in the Crimean War, the Ottomans had been forced to rely upon the aid of Britain and France to sustain itself in conflict against the Russians. The Empire had previously been called the &quot;Sick Man of Europe&quot;, but prior to the war it was called the &quot;Dying Man of Europe&quot;.

Only sparse pieces of the Balkans remained in Ottoman control by 1914, and they were being encroached on from many fronts.  The Austrians in the north clearly wanted to pacify provinces in the region, the Russians in the east wanted Istanbul itself to guarantee themselves a safe passage through to the Mediterranean from their Black Sea ports, and the people who lived in the Balkans were beginning to experience their own internal unrest.  By 1914 it looked like conflict could erupt at any moment in the Balkans.

==== Naval build up and the end of Splendid Isolation ====

In order to demonstrate their military capability, Germany embarked on a plan to build up her navy, constructing the High Seas Fleet, equipping it with the latest in military technology.  This not only contributed to a rise in Germany's military power, but it also seriously alarmed Great Britain.  Britain had long subscribed to the theory of ''Splendid Isolation'', under which Britain attempted to hold itself aloft from affair on the continent.  Protected by the Royal Navy, the most powerful navy in Europe, Britain had remained inviolate to foreign powers for centuries; even Napoleon was unable to land an army on her shores.  Under Splendid Isolation, Britain chose to abstain from permanent relationships with European powers and to continually work to maintain a balance between them, all the while protected from continental strife by her powerful navy.

The construction of the German High Seas Fleet pushed Britain into a fury of shipbuilding, in an attempt to stay ahead of German production.  The knowledge that they could no longer stand by in the distance and remain safe from European struggle, and the continuing threat created by German armament programs, propelled the British out of their self-imposed isolation.  It also led to a souring of relations between both Britain and Germany.

==== Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand ====

On June 28, 1914, at approximately 11:00 am, Franz Ferdinand and his wife were killed in Sarajevo, the capital of the Austro-Hungarian province of Bosnia and Herzegovina, by Gavrilo Princip, a member of Young Bosnia and one of several (seven) assassins organized by The Black Hand (Crna Ruka). The event, known as the Assassination in Sarajevo, was one of the main triggers of World War I.

== War Breaks Out ==
Officially, the First World War began on June 28, 1914 in the Bosnian city of Sarajevo, with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of the Austro-Hungarian Empire by Gavrilo Principe, a  member of a secret Serbian society, The Black Hand, hoping to unite the Slavic speaking lands of the Austro-Hungarian Empire with the nearby Kingdom of Serbia. In retaliation, Austria, with the support of Germany, presented Serbia with a list of demands that would severely threaten the Kingdom's autonomy. The Austrian leaders had been waiting for this moment for several years, because they feared just the sort of Serbian groups that were now operating in Bosnia, and had been waiting for this chance to weaken Serbia for several years. After consultations with the Russians, Serbia rejected the demands, leading to war with Austria. Russia responded with a general mobilization, followed by Austria's ally Germany and Russia's ally France. The first stage of the war quickly escalated, with a general war breaking out between an alliance of Germany and Austria against Russia, France, and Serbia.

The war presented the Germans with a special problem. Their own armies were scattered on the country's eastern and western borders against France to the west and Russia to the east, but the armies of France and Russia were concentrated against the Germans on their respective borders. In order to make the best out of this two front situation, the German generals began to carry out the '''Schlieffen Plan''', developed by a German general in case of war with both France and Russia. The plan called for a quick and massive strike against the French while the massive Russian army was still mobilizing, hoping that their Austrian allies could stop the Russian advance long enough for them to finish off the French and move their troops by rail to defend the east.

Unfortunately, the quickest way to strike the French capital, Paris, and knock the French out of the war involved a broad offensive through neutral Belgium. Great Britain, a nominal ally of France, promised to intervene in case Germany invaded Belgium, and declared war shortly after German forces crossed the border. The Germans initially expected the Belgians to put up very little resistance, but this proved to be incorrect and the longer than expected time required to defeat the Belgians allowed the French to regroup.

While the Germans were pushing deep into Belgium, Serbian forces crossed the Danube in a daring attack against the Austrians. This offensive, like many others after it, failed, and the war zone along the Balkans would change very little during the first year.

Meanwhile, the massive German offensive bearing down on France was beginning to run out of steam. First, the Russians scored several early victories against the Austrians and moved through Poland (then a Russian territory) on their way to attack Prussia and the vulnerable German capital, Berlin. The worried German generals withdrew several divisions to the eastern front, allowing the French to regroup and defeat the German lead elements at the Battle of the Marne, slightly more than 15 miles outside Paris.

Though the German armies were stopped by the French, the Russian armies bearing down on Prussia were similarly defeated by German forces under Field Marshall Hindenburg at the Masurian Lakes, and then at Tannenberg. Though the Russian army was much larger than the German army, the Russian commander's decision to split his forces in a two-prong attack contributed to his defeat, and allowed the Germans to break apart the offensive piecemeal.

== Stalemate and Trench Warfare ==

Following these defeats, the war on both fronts bogged down. In the west, both French and British forces and the Germans built a massive series of trenches from the Swiss border to the North Sea to defend their positions. This period of &quot;Trench Warfare&quot; saw very little change in the battle lines, and several uses of poison gas by the Germans.

With no major breakthroughs on either fronts, and furthermore the people in Russia were killed. German and British leaders looked to the Mediterranean to break the stalemate. This put the two remaining neutral powers, Italy and the Ottoman Empire (later Turkey) in a tough position. Before the war, the Italians had agreed to support Germany and Austria in case of war. However, British and French diplomats promised the Italians the Austrian territories adjacent to Venice if Italy declared war, which they did after the prodding of many Italian radicals, among them Mussolini. The Ottoman Empire also had to make a tough choice, because Britain was the Empire's traditional protector and Russia was the Empire's traditional enemy. Germany's offer of two battleships and Middle Eastern territories allowed the Turks to strike out at both simultaneously, beginning with a naval strike against the Russian naval base at Odessa. The Ottoman entry into the war encouraged neighboring Bulgaria to also enter the war in an alliance with Germany, leading to the rapid defeat and occupation of Serbia by the Austrians. Austria played an important part in the war and still is today a leading military nation.

In 1915 the Ottomans launched an attack into Egypt in an attempt to capture the Suez Canal. The assault failed and the Ottomans retreated back into their empire. Once again in 1916 the Ottomans attempted to capture the canal, but this once again failed. This attack convinced the British to push their defence of the Canal further out, into the Sinai, and so starting in October, the British under Lieutenant General Sir Charles Dobell began operations into the Sinai desert and on to the border of Palestine. Initial efforts were limited to building a railway and a waterline across the Sinai. After several months building up supplies and troops, the British were ready for an attack. The first battle was the capture of Magdhaba on December 23 1916. This was a success, the fort was captured.

In 1916, the Central Powers invaded Romania, and forced them to sign an unwilling peace.

== America Enters the War ==

By 1916, the two groups had been fighting for two years with neither side making significant gains. Food shortages had appeared in Germany (under blockade by Britain) and Russia, leading to much discontent. Responding to the British blockade, the Germans launched a naval offensive of their own, using submarines known as U-Boats to prey on allied shipping.

=== The Lusitania ===

A British-American tourist cruise liner that was intentionally sunk by a German U-Boat. However, there was some ammunition onboard in the cargo area, and this was the German reason for sinking.

=== The Zimmerman Telegram ===

A telegram from Germany to Mexico that encouraged Mexico to attack the United States.

This telegram was provided to the United States by Great Britain and there has been some speculation on whether it was forged by Great Britain in order to get the previously neutral United States to join World War I

==Defeat of the Central Powers==
