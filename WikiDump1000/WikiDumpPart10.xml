'''Note''': This page must remain [[Wikibooks:Protected page|protected]] for legal reasons.

All text is irrevocably licensed to the public under one or several liberal licenses, and is copyrighted by contributors to Wikibooks unless otherwise noted (for example; public domain text or other text where permission was given or obtained). Most of Wikibooks' text is dual licensed under the [[Wikibooks:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License]] (CC-BY-SA) and the [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]] (GFDL) (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts). Some text may be only available under CC-BY-SA and CC-BY-SA-compatible license and cannot be reused under GFDL; such text will be identified either on the page footer, in the page history, or the discussion page of the module that utilizes the text.

Wikibooks content can be copied, modified, and redistributed if and only if the copied version is made available on the same terms to others and acknowledgment of the authors of the work used is included (a link back to the book or module is generally thought to satisfy the attribution requirement; see below for more details). Copied content will therefore remain free under appropriate license and can continue to be used by anyone subject to certain restrictions, most of which aim to ensure that freedom.

To this end,

* Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify Wikibooks' text under the terms of the [[Wikibooks:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License]] and, unless otherwise noted, the [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|GNU Free Documentation License]]. unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts.
* Content on Wikibooks is covered by [[Wikibooks:General disclaimer|disclaimers]].

The English text of the CC-BY-SA and GFDL licenses are the only legally binding restriction between authors and users of Wikibooks content. What follows is Wikibooks interpretation of CC-BY-SA and GFDL, as it pertains to the rights and obligations of users and contributors.

== Contributors' rights and obligations ==

All creative works are copyrighted, by international agreement, unless either they fall into the public domain or their copyright is explicitly disclaimed.

If you contribute text directly to Wikibooks, '''you irrevocably agree to license it to the public for reuse under CC-BY-SA and GFDL (unversioned, with no invariant sections, front-cover texts, or back-cover texts). You also agree to be credited by re-users, at minimum, through a hyperlink or URL to the page you are contributing to. See [[Foundation:Terms of Use|Terms of Use]] for details.''' Non-text media may be contributed under a variety of different licenses that support the general goal of allowing unrestricted re-use and re-distribution. See [[Wikibooks:Media]] for details.

If you want to import text that you have found elsewhere or that you have co-authored with others, you can only do so if it is available under terms that are compatible with the CC-BY-SA license. You do not need to ensure or guarantee that the imported text is available under the GNU Free Documentation License. Furthermore, please note that you cannot import information which is available only under the GFDL. In other words, you may only import text that is (a) single-licensed under terms compatible with the CC-BY-SA license or (b) dual-licensed with the GFDL and another license with terms compatible with the CC-BY-SA license. If you are the sole author of the material, you must license it under both CC-BY-SA and GFDL.

If the material, text or media, has been previously published and you wish to use it under appropriate license, you will need to verify copyright permission. If you are not a copyright holder, you will still need to verify copyright permission. '''Never''' use materials that infringe the copyrights of others. This could create legal liabilities and seriously hurt Wikibooks. If in doubt, write the content yourself, thereby creating a new copyrighted work which can be included without trouble.

You retain copyright to materials you contribute to Wikibooks, text and media. Copyright is ''never'' transferred to Wikibooks. You can later republish and relicense them in any way you like. However, you can never retract or alter the license for copies of materials that you place here; these copies will remain so licensed until they enter the public domain when your copyright expires (currently some decades after an author's death).

If you do not agree with these terms, then do not submit your work to Wikibooks.

== Reusers' rights and obligations ==
The only Wikibooks content you should contact the Wikimedia Foundation about is the trademarked Wikibooks/Wikimedia logos, which are not freely usable without permission (members of the media, see [[Foundation:Press room]]). If you want to use other Wikibooks materials in your own books/articles/websites or other publications, you can do so, but only in compliance with the licensing terms. Please follow the guidelines below:

===Re-use of text===
;Attribution: To re-distribute a text page in any form, provide credit to the authors either by including a) a hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the page or pages you are re-using, b) a hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy which is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on this website, or c) a list of all authors. (Any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions.) This applies to text developed by the Wikibooks community. Text from external sources may attach additional attribution requirements to the work, which should be indicated on an module's face or on its talk page. For example, a page may have a banner or other notation indicating that some or all of its content was originally published somewhere else. Where such notations are visible in the page itself, they should generally be preserved by re-users.

;Copyleft/Share Alike: If you make modifications or additions to the page you re-use, you must license them under the Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike License 3.0 or later.
;Indicate changes: If you make modifications or additions, you must indicate in a reasonable fashion that the original work has been modified. If you are re-using the page in a wiki, for example, indicating this in the page history is sufficient.
;Licensing notice: Each copy or modified version that you distribute must include a licensing notice stating that the work is released under CC-BY-SA and either a) a hyperlink or URL to the text of the license or b) a copy of the license. For this purpose, a suitable URL is: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/

'''For further information''', please refer to the [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/legalcode legal code of the CC-BY-SA License].

For compatibility reasons, any page which does not incorporate text that is exclusively available under CC-BY-SA or a CC-BY-SA-compatible license is also available under the terms of the [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html GNU Free Documentation License]. In order to determine whether a page is available under the GFDL, review the page footer, page history, and discussion page for attribution of single-licensed content that is not GFDL-compatible. All text published before June 15th, 2009 on Wikibooks was released under the GFDL, and you may also use the page history to retrieve content published before that date to ensure GFDL compatibility.

===Re-use of non-text media===

Where not otherwise noted, non-text media files are available under various free culture licenses, consistent with the [[Wikibooks:Media]]. Please view the media description page for details about the license of any specific media file.

=== Non-free materials and special requirements ===

Wikibooks' materials may also include quotations, images, or other media under the U.S. Copyright law &quot;fair use&quot; doctrine. ''In Wikibooks'', such &quot;fair use&quot; material should be identified as from an external source by an appropriate method (on the image description page, or history page, as appropriate; quotations should be denoted with quotation marks or block quotation. This leads to possible restrictions on the use, outside of Wikibooks, of such &quot;fair use&quot; content retrieved from Wikibooks: this &quot;fair use&quot; content does not fall under the CC-BY-SA or GFDL license as such, but under the &quot;fair use&quot; (or similar/different) regulations in the country where the media are retrieved.

== Linking to copyrighted works ==

Since most recently-created works are copyrighted, almost any book on Wikibooks which cites sources will link to copyrighted material. It is usually not necessary to obtain the permission of a copyright holder before linking to copyrighted material, just as an author of a dead-tree book does not need permission to cite someone else's work in their bibliography. Likewise, Wikibooks is not restricted to linking only to CC-BY-SA or open-source content.

==If you are the owner of Wikibooks-hosted content being used without your permission==

If you are the owner of content that is being used on Wikibooks without your permission, then please contact our [[wmf:Designated agent|designated agent]] to have it permanently removed (blanking the page is not enough, it will still be in the page history). You may also blank the page and replace it with {{tlx|copyvio|''URL or place you published the text''}}. Either way, we will, of course, need some evidence to support your claim of ownership. This will automatically add the page to [[:Category:Copyright violations]] which is reviewed by administrators at Wikibooks.

| text = As of July 15, 2009 Wikibooks has moved to a dual-licensing system that supersedes the previous GFDL only licensing.  In short, this means that text licensed under the GFDL only can no longer be imported to Wikibooks, retroactive to 1 November 2008.  Additionally, Wikibooks text might or might not now be exportable under the GFDL depending on whether or not any content was added and not removed since July 15.

Version 1.3, 3 November 2008
Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

==0. PREAMBLE==

The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license designed for free software.

We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

==1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS==

This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law.

A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language.

A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.

The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none.

The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.

A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only.

The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

The &quot;publisher&quot; means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public.

A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.) To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot; of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.

The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License.

==2. VERBATIM COPYING==

You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies.

==3. COPYING IN QUANTITY==

If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.

If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.

It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

==4. MODIFICATIONS==

You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

&lt;ol type=&quot;A&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Include an unaltered copy of this License.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot; section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may not be included in the Modified version.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties—for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.

You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

==5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS==

You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.

The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled &quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.

==6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS==

You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

==7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS==

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation's users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate.

==8. TRANSLATION==

Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.

If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;, &quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title.

==9. TERMINATION==

You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.

However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it.

==10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE==

The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.

==11. RELICENSING==

&quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration Site&quot; (or &quot;MMC Site&quot;) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A &quot;Massive Multiauthor Collaboration&quot; (or &quot;MMC&quot;) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site.

&quot;CC-BY-SA&quot; means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization.

&quot;Incorporate&quot; means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document.

&lt;AUTHOR | WEBMASTER&gt;,

I really liked your &lt;CONTENT&gt;! I found it very informative and useful. I would love to use it in a project I'm involved with called Wikibooks, so I'm seeking your permission.

Wikibooks http://wikibooks.org is a collection of free non-fiction books (only textbooks) that is collaboratively-edited by volunteers from around the world.  You might have heard of our sister project, Wikipedia ( http://wikipedia.org ), which is a very large online encyclopedia that, in less than four years' time, amassed well over 2 million articles - just in the English language version. However, the Wikibooks project is just starting to write our first textbooks and we hope to duplicate Wikipedia's success in the realm of collaboratively-edited textbooks.

I'd like to include your materials in this Wikibook http://wikibooks.org/wiki/&lt;RELEVANT_WIKIBOOK_START_PAGE/TOC&gt;. To get a sense of the freedom of Wikibooks, you could even edit this without registration right now.

However, we can only use your materials if you are willing to grant permission for us to use your above referenced work under terms of the Creative Commons Attribution/Share-Alike License 3.0. This means anybody will have the right to share your materials and update them: for example, to keep up with new information. You can read this license in full at:

== What is a talk page? ==
A '''talk page''' is a special page containing discussion about the contents of its associated &quot;subject&quot; page. To view the talk page of a [[Help:Glossary#module|module]] (or any other page in Wikibooks), click on the &quot;Discuss this page&quot; link in the sidebar or at the bottom of the screen. When you are in the talk page, clicking on &quot;View module&quot; will take you back to the main module.

Inevitably, there will arise situations in which collaborators on a module can benefit mutually from discussing the module--thus we have designated a [[WB:NS|namespace]] specifically for such discussions.

== What is it used for? ==
On Wikibooks, the purpose of a talk page is to help to improve the contents of the main page, from an [[Wikibooks:neutral point of view|neutral point of view]]. Questions, challenges, excised text (due to truly egregious confusion or bias, for example), arguments relevant to changing the text, and commentary on the main page is all fair play.

[[WB:SOAP|Wikibooks is not a soapbox]], it's a collection of non-fiction books. In other words, talk about the module, not about the subject. It's only the habits we encourage that keeps Wikibooks from turning into another [[w:H2G2|H2G2]] or [[w:Everything2|Everything2]]. See also: [[Wikibooks:Etiquette|Wikipetiquette]]

That said, [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians]] are fallible creatures, so it's entirely natural that a bit of partisan wrangling takes place on talk pages - and occasionally this even leads to improvements in the module! So there's a fair degree of tolerance, and most Wikibookians succumb to a bit of wrangling from time to time.

== User talk pages ==
Your user page has a talk page as well. There is a link to it in the header next to your name (if you use a &quot;skin&quot; other than the default it may be somewhere else). Also, if edits are made to it by others, the text '''You have new messages''' will appear at the top of the page. These pages can be used for occasional personal communication among users; but note that these pages are public. If you want to communicate privately, use e-mail.

To write in another user's talk page, click the ''Discuss this page'' link on your sidebar when you view the user page (which you can do by clicking on a user's nickname). On the list of recent changes and on your watchlist, you can directly access a user's talk page by following the (Talk) link behind the user's name / [[w:IP address|IP address]].

==&quot;Post a comment&quot; feature==
For editing a talk page, one can optionally use the &quot;Post a comment&quot; feature, but only for a new thread and for a reply to be put at the bottom of the last thread.

*For a new thread, fill in the &quot;Subject/headline&quot; box. Then the [[Help:Glossary#edit summary|edit summary]] is automatically the same as the new [[Help:Glossary#section|section]] header.

*For a reply to be put at the bottom of the last thread, do not fill in the &quot;Subject/headline&quot; box. In this case it is not possible to supply an edit summary. Instead, edit the previous thread.

When using &quot;Post a comment&quot;, an edit conflict is impossible. However, in the case that you are not starting a new thread but replying to an existing one, your response may be appended to a newly created post that was added while you wrote yours. It is therefore generally recommended to use [[Help:Glossary#section|section editing]] to respond, and &quot;Post a comment&quot; to start new threads. If your comment is accidentally misplaced, just edit the page and move it.

== Standards and conventions of writing and layout ==
A few community standards do apply to talk pages, these are not to be taken strictly as &quot;rules&quot; but were evolved by users to make the talk pages more useful and easier to read. Often the talk pages of controversial topics can be very heavily used. 

* '''Sign your posts:''' To sign a post, type three tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;), and they will be replaced with your username after saving, like this: [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]. Type four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;), and they will be replaced with your username and time stamp, like this: [[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 03:44 Jul 10, 2003 (UTC). On Wikibooks we recommend that you try to always sign your posts on talk pages. You can also use a pseudonym, or just &quot;--anon&quot;.

*'''Use indenting to keep the conversation straight:'''  The first contributor is all the way to the left, the next person starts with one colon (:), the next person starts with two colons.  Then, when the first contributor responds, she starts at the left margin again, and the second and third persons continue to mark themselves with one and two colons respectively,  In that way, who is saying what is clear.

*'''Separate discussion topics:''' Put each new topic under a different headline (&lt;nowiki&gt;== Subject ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;). The &quot;Post a comment&quot; feature accomplishes this automatically when you enter a subject line. The [[Help:Glossary#edit summary|edit summary]] is automatically the same as this header. Thus every thread is a section. This allows section editing of the thread in question. You can also use horizontal lines (----), although some users strongly dislike them.

*'''Proceed vertically:''' The further down the contribution to talk, the later it was made.

*'''Feel free to ignore typographical conventions:'''  Do as you please to make your points clear.  The [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] is for just modules and Wikibooks.  

*'''Make links freely''':  Links to modules are as useful on talk pages as anywhere else, and links to non-existent modules can help get them onto the [[Special:Wantedpages|most wanted pages]] list.

*'''Don't edit other people's words:'''  Please don't ever do this (except for obvious typing errors) but editing or deleting your own words is up to you.  (but contrast this with suggestions on refactoring below - this could be considered a simplistic approach)

*'''Archive rather than delete:''' When a talk page's content has become extremely large or the discussion of the issue in hand has simply died down and no one has a reasonable chance of adding to it. Then create a new page. (See [[Help:How to contribute]] for details.) Place the page in a talk or Wikibooks namespace. Give it an explanatory name. Often people simply add &quot;archive&quot; to the original name. Explain on the archive page where the text you plan to archive will come from and provide a link. Cut the relevant content from the original page and paste it into the new page. Replace the text on the original page with a link to the archive.

*'''Summarize discussion''' (or '''refactor'''): After a discussion on a page has died down for several weeks or the discussion has become heated and long, you (if you can be smart and respectful at the same time) might replace the discussion with a summary of major points, as though you were (!) writing an encyclopedia module about the discussion. If the discussion entailed opposing arguments, present the arguments from an unbiased point of view. Where possible, distinguish the common ground from the points of contention. See '''''Refactoring talk pages''''' below.

*'''Keep to the topic:'''  Not layout, but worth keeping in mind.  Talk page discussions can be much more humorous and POV than the typical module, but [[Wikibooks:No personal attacks|personal attacks]] don't do much to make modules better.

== Example ==
This module is great.  [[User:Maveric149|mav]] 18:20 Jul 30, 2003 (UTC)

:No it isn't! --fish

::Yes it is!  --wojahowicz

:I was talking to mav! --fish

:::Now, now.  [[User:Toby Bartels|Toby Bartels]]

'''Need this more?'''

We need a module on [[kindness]] more than we need this mess. --Alfred the butler

:Yeah, but what about [[rubber baby buggy bumpers]]?  -- Comissioner gordon

== Refactoring talk pages ==
''from [[Wikibooks:editing policy|editing policy]]''

A point of terminology: the notion of [[w:refactoring|refactoring]], in the context of a wiki, means basically cleaning up and reorganizing a page such that all the useful information on the page is preserved and made more accessible. It's relatively rare that one needs to entirely refactor a Wikibooks module--usually, edits and additions are what is necessary.

The purpose of talk pages is to assist in creating better modules.
Therefore, the purpose of refactoring talk page discussions is to help create good textbook modules, at least in the long run.
A short-run purpose is to channel a discussion in a useful direction, that is, to help aim it at the future time when it can be used in an textbook module.

There are a number of talk or other discussion oriented pages which could use a bit of traditional Wiki refactoring. There's useful content there, sometimes, that can be transferred to the module itself. Sometimes large chunks of old talk pages can be completely wiped out with no harm done--feel free to do so, unless you think there's some value in preserving the discussion. In refactoring a talk page, one solid recommendation is to use the traditional wiki refactoring technique of adding a summary with whatever consensus we've arrived at the top, grouping separate discussion items together, and placing them towards the bottom.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Adapted from [[en:Wikipedia:Talk page]]

I say we make this an official guideline (because it doesnt need the weight of an enforced policy). --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 21:56, 28 November 2005 (UTC)

:Wouldn't this be better as a Help page in the help namespace rather than as a policy? [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 12:19, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

A guideline at best. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:45, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

== Move To Reject, and include in Help Namespace ==

I think we all have the gist of this one. It doesnt need to be an actual policy, however the information here is certainly valuable enough to keep around. I am motioning to '''Reject''' this proposal, and move the information here to the help namespace. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]]&lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 16:43, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

: Agreed. [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:32, 12 July 2006 (UTC)

:: Agreed, just another thing why ''Archive rather than delete'', the talk history is a safer (a restricted number can edit it) and takes less resources (as in space, navigation),work consuming (no need to be managed) place to keep the, herr, history of the page. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:23, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

::: The search feature only allows you to search existing pages, not their histories. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 05:22, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

'''Done'''. I have moved this page to {{tl|rejected}}. I will work on moving the relevant text from this policy to the help namespace. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 00:26, 10 October 2006 (UTC)

== Is it permissible to copy the contents of the  existing books whose copyrights have expired verbatim ==

I am looking at few books in the http://www.archive.org/search.php?query=shabda . 
As per the site, the content is in public domain.  However, I am not sure if we can re-type the content to create an wiki book.

The reason why I want to recreate the book instead of using the scanned versions specified are
a. they are scanned versions and are not being searchable
b. since the books specified are quite old, sometimes the content is not very clear.

Please let me know, if wikbooks discourages recreation of books whose copyrights have expired. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Ksrikanth gen|Ksrikanth gen]] ([[User talk:Ksrikanth gen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ksrikanth gen|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:For books that have actually been published and which are now in the public domain, [[s:|Wikisource]] is your best bet.  There, source documents are preserved with few changes other than proofreading.  Wikibooks is good if you plan to create a new textbook from scratch. &amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;small&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]]&lt;/small&gt; 21:44, 5 August 2010 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the Wikibook about Artificial Intelligence. 

==Book Contents==

The following is a first proposal for a basic layout. This is not yet complete, ideas are welcome. Discuss on the talk page or just add them here.

The book is laid out into 5 sections, with increasing detail and complexity. Each section contains a number of chapters. In addition to regular chapters, there are case-study chapters that investigate full and complex AI systems using several techniques from the regular chapters (as well as perhaps some new ones).

* [[/Probability|Probability]]: Describing the basics (philosophical and mathematical) of probability theory inference.

===Basic AI topics===

* '''Planning, Decision making and Problem Solving''': Expanding on the search chapter to show how simple agents and simple intelligent behavior can be created. Examples are solving a puzzle, navigating a small maze (with pits and monsters) or planning a trip to the supermarket.
* '''Uncertainty''': Introduction to reasoning, planning and decision making with uncertainty.
* ''Case Study'' - '''Building a (relatively) strong game AI''': Building a strong AI for some game (to be chosen) that combines techniques from the planning and uncertainty chapters. This should go deeper than the simplified algorithms that most books describe and actually produce a strong playing AI.

* '''Inference in Logic''': Backward and Forward chaining, Resolution and Logic Programming.
* '''Knowledge Engineering''': Ways to describe and store complicated knowledge. Databases, OO concepts, knowledge bases, representing space and time, inference from large datasets, diagnosis system etc.

* '''Natural Language''': Stuff like Markov models, POS taggers and CFG's.
* '''Machine Learning''': The basic idea of Machine Learning, (learning based on examples), and explanations of the basic techniques
* ''Case Study'' - '''Artificial Life''': Describes an environment with several evolving agents and some different techniques to construct agents. This should be able to draw on and compare pretty much all the chapters from section 2 (including the natural language chapter).
* ''Philosophical Issues for Artificial Intelligence'': Discusses AI problems typically dealt with by philosophers, such as what is theoretically possible to achieve with AI, whether programs can be conscious, or feel pain, intentionality, and symbol grounding.

===More advanced topics and techniques in AI===

* [[/Bayesian Decision Theory/]]
* {{stage short|50%|25-Nov-2006}} '''[[/Neural Networks/Introduction|Neural Networks]] and related models'''
** [[/Neural Networks/Natural Neural Networks|Natural Neural Networks]] and modeling of the Brain
** [[/Neural Networks/Distributed Processing|Distributed Processing]] and other advanced Networks

* '''Advanced Expert Systems''': Expands on the basic expert systems explained in ''Knowledge Engineering'' in section 2. Includes more in depth explanation of Bayesian Networks than in the ''Machine Learning'' section.

* ''Case Study'' - '''Data Mining''': Describes mining a large dataset (perhaps some part of the wikipedia database) using machine learning algorithms, using software like Weka. 

* '''Advanced Natural Language''': A description of the various techniques for dealing with tenses, sentence focus, presuppositions, etc. in NLP and NLG. This focuses mostly on the underlying structure of language and how to translate into some logical language, rather than statistical methods and models.
* '''Natural Language Learning''': Deals with more advanced statistical models for learning to understand language.

* ''Case Study'' - '''Dialogue System''': Building system that can communicate (intelligently) in written natural language. In a nutshell, trying to pass the Turing test. Three basic paradigms; case based reasoning (like ALICE), Logic based (translating everything to and from some extended version of predicate logic) and some machine learning based solution.

===Highly specific AI topics and techniques===

* '''Machine Vision''': Interpreting visual data. Face recognition, 3d reconstruction etc. 
* Bayesian Decision Theory
* Linear Discriminants and Perceptron
* Support Vector Machines
* Parameteric Techniques
* Non-parametric Techniques
* '''Speech Recognition, Text to Speech and OCR'''
* '''Advanced Logics''': Advanced logic systems.
* '''Reinforcement Learning'''
* '''Robotics''': Detailed and technical introduction to the three basic paradigms of robotics. Deals with software and hardware. (Define: [[w:situated robotics|situated robotics]].)

There are several ways to explore Wikibooks:

# Follow [[WB:LINK|links]] from page to page.
# [[#Searching|Search]] for something specific using the search box that appears on every page.
# [[WB:CCO|Browse]] through our books by [[Subject:Books by subject|subject]], by [[:Category:Books by completion status|completion status]], [[:Category:Books by reading level|reading level]], or by [[WB:ABC|title]].
# Explore a [[Special:Randompage|random page]], or from the navigation bar a random book.
# View what [[WB:RC|recent changes]] people have been making, or only to pages [[WB:WATCHLIST|you're watching]].
# From any page you can find out [[#What links here|what links there]].
# From any page you can click [[Special:SpecialPages|Special pages]] to access [[Special:Newpages|Newly created pages]] and [[Special:Allpages|All pages by title]]
# Use [[#Keyboard shortcuts|keyboard shortcuts]] to move around even more quickly.

{{TOC|float=none|limit=2}}

==Searching==
{{shortcut|WB:SEARCH}}

Wikibooks has an extremely powerful search engine built in, which can be used to locate material on Wikibooks more easily and more precisely than well known external [[w:web search engine|web search engine]]s such as [[w:Google|Google]] and [[w:Yahoo!|Yahoo!]].

The search box is located at the top right on every page on the standard Wikibooks skin (Vector). It will take you to the page which matches your query, otherwise it displays the search results. To display the full search results, click on the last item in drop-down list (which says «{{int:vector-simplesearch-containing}}»), or perform an empty search. The direct link for the advanced interface is [[Special:Search]].

===Search results page===
The default search only applies to the Mainspace (where most books are stored) and [[Subject:Books by subject|subjects]] (topic portals).  Other types of content pages can be searched by selecting an option from the grey search types box below the search input box. 

If ''Multimedia'' is selected, you can search images, videos, and audio stored on Wikibooks or our shared media repository, [[w:Wikimedia Commons|Wikimedia Commons]]. This option will search their file names and descriptions.

If ''Help and Project pages'' is selected, you can search the &quot;Help&quot; and &quot;Wikibooks&quot; [[WB:NS|namespaces]]. These namespaces contain help pages, Wikibooks guidelines and policies, and all pages used for administration and maintenance of the site.

If ''Everything'' is selected, you can search all namespaces.

To search in any subset of namespaces, click ''Advanced'' on the search form. A quicker way to search a single namespace is to type the namespace, a colon, then the search term in the search box, for example {{search link|Wikibooks:Categories}} returns search results for catetgories in the Wikibooks namespace. 

[[Wikibooks:Registered users|Registered users]] can modify the default namespace to search in [[WB:PREFS|&quot;My Preferences&quot;]]. They can also choose how much context and how many hits per page to display when viewing search results.

===Navigation pages===
Navigation pages will attempt to guide you to the correct book.  You may encounter two types of these pages when searching for a topic. 

; Subjects: You may type in something like [[Languages]], that takes you to a list of the many things that you could mean by it . This type of page is called a subject page, and it's there to make things easier for you. Such a page prevents you from having to guess the exact phrase used to identify each book.
; Redirection: Some things can be referred to by many names. The [[United Kingdom History]], for instance, could be called the [[History of the United Kingdom]], the [[History of the UK]], or many similar things. Searching is set up so that if you search for any of those terms, you will be &quot;redirected&quot; to the proper place. If instead of being redirected you are taken to a search menu, then you have searched for a phrase that has not been set up to redirect to a book. In such a case, you may look through the search results for an appropriate topic, try searching for an alternative spelling or name for the term, or try something related like [[History]]. Once you have found what you were looking for, consider adding [[WB:REDIRECT|redirect pages]] for the expressions that you tried that did not lead to a book or subject because chances are that you are not the only one thinking about the topic in this way. Thus, in doing so you will make life easier for those who later search for the term.

===Search engine features===
The internal search engine can search for parts of page titles or page title prefixes, and in specific [[Help:Categories|categories]] and [[WB:NS|namespaces]]. It can also limit a search to pages with specific words in the title or located in specific categories or namespaces. It can handle parameters an order of magnitude more sophisticated than most external search engines, including user-specified words with variable endings and similar spellings. When presenting results, the internal search understands and will link to relevant sections of a page (although to a limited degree some other search engines may do this as well).

The internal search is also able to search all pages for project purposes, whereas external search engines cannot be used on any talk page, a large part of project space, and any page tagged with &lt;nowiki&gt;__NOINDEX__&lt;/nowiki&gt; (usually used on [[Wikibooks:User pages|user pages]].

The source text (what one sees in the edit box) is searched. This distinction is relevant for [[Help:Editing#Piped links|piped links]], for [[Help:Editing#Interlanguage links|interlanguage links]] (to find links to Chinese books, search for zh, not for Zhongwen), special characters (if ê is coded as &amp;amp;ecirc; it is found searching for ecirc), etc.

Upper and lower case as well as some [[w:Trema (diacritic)|umlauts]] and [[w:Diacritic|accents]] are disregarded in search. For example, a search for ''citroen'' will find pages containing the word ''Citroën'' (c = C, e = ë). Some [[w:Typographic ligature|ligatures]] match the separate letters. For example, a search for ''aeroskobing'' will find pages containing ''Ærøskøbing'' (ae = Æ).

The following features can be used to refine searches:

* '''Phrases in double quotes''' - A phrase can be searched by enclosing it in double quotes. For example, ''{{Search link|&quot;holly dolly&quot;|&quot;holly dolly&quot;}}'' returns fewer few results as opposed to ''{{Search link|holly dolly|holly dolly}}'' (two standalone words). This technique also allows one to find all occurrences of a word or name across Wikibooks rather than being directed automatically to a book or a subject page.
* '''Boolean search''' - By default logical AND is applied to all search terms, just as on all major search engines. Parentheses and &quot;OR&quot; can also be used. For example ''{{Search link|windows OR system}}'' and combined: ''{{Search link|microsoft (windows OR system)}}'' (note the uppercase OR).
* '''Exclusion''' - Terms can be excluded with -, for example ''{{Search link|windows&amp;nbsp; -system}}'' (note ''there is no space'' between &quot;-&quot; and the excluded term)
* '''Wildcard search''' - Wildcards (characters taking the place of any other character or string that is not known or specified) can be prefixed and suffixed, for example, the query ''{{search link|&quot;*stan&quot;}}'' would match books like ''Kazakhstan'' and ''Afghanistan''.
* '''Fuzzy search''' - Adding a tilde (~) at the end of a search word matches words with similar spelling. For example, searching for ''{{search link|james~ watt~}}'' would identify ''James Watt'', ''James Wyatt'', and ''James Watts'' as the first three search results.
* '''intitle:''' - using the ''intitle:'' parameter, query results can be narrowed by title. The search '''word'''(s) given to ''intitle:'' can be anywhere in the title.  Example searches using ''intitle:''

::{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!  Query
!  Result
|-
|  ''{{search link|intitle:airport}}''
|  All books with airport in their title.
|-
|  ''{{search link|intitle:international airport}}''
|  Books containing international and airport in their title.
|-
|  ''{{search link|parking intitle:airport}}''
|  Books with &quot;airport&quot; in their title and &quot;parking&quot; in their text
|-
|  ''{{search link|intitle:&quot;international airport&quot;}}''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|  Books containing the exact expression &quot;international airport&quot; in their title.
|}

* '''prefix:''' - use the ''prefix:'' parameter to limit the results to book titles starting with the given '''characters'''.  If a namespace is also given to ''prefix:'', that page name will override any and all other namespace searches. ''Prefix:'' should be the last parameter in the query.  Example searches using ''prefix:''

::{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
!  Query
!  Result
|-
|  ''{{search link|Salvage wreck prefix:USS}}''
|  Books containing the words ''salvage'' and ''wreck'' whose title starts with the characters &quot;USS&quot;.
|-
|  ''{{search link|prefix:Wikibooks:Reading room/}}''
|  [[Help:Editing#Subpage links|Subpages]] of [[Wikibooks:Reading room]].
|-
|  ''{{search link|&quot;subject namespace&quot;  readers prefix:Wikibooks talk:}}''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|  Discussions of any page in the Wikibooks namespace page having the word ''readers'' and the phrase ''portal namespace''.
|-
|  ''{{search link|ocean heat reservoir prefix:Talk:Main Page/Archive}}''
|  Any archived discussion with the words ''heat'' and ''ocean'' and ''reservoir''.
|-
|  ''{{search link|language prefix:Subject:Languages}}''
|  Subject namespace page names that begin with &quot;Subject:Languages&quot; and have the word ''language'' in the page.
|}

====Using the search to directly get to a page====
When using the search to directly get to a page, it doesn't matter whether you enter capitals or lower case letters (unless there are two book titles which differ only in capitalization). [[w:Trema (diacritic)|Umlauts]] and [[w:Diacritic|accents]] are also disregarded, but [[w:Typographic ligature|ligatures]] do not match the separate letters.

Specialized uses of the search to directly get to a page include the following:
*To navigate to a [[WB:SECTION|section]] of a page using anchor notation. For example, '''Poland#History'''. 
*To navigate to a [[Special:SpecialPages|special page]], including one with a parameter following a slash. For example, '''Special:Log/Example'''.
*To navigate directly to a page on another language Wikipedia or Wikimedia project, using the appropriate [[Help:Editing#Interwiki links|interwiki]] prefix; some [[meta:Interwiki map|other prefixes]] work too. For example, enter '''fr:France''' to go to the book &quot;France&quot; on French Wikibooks, or '''wikt:help''' to see the Wiktionary entry for the word &quot;help&quot;. 
*To go quickly to the [[WB:CONTRIBS|user contributions]] of an IP address – just enter the address. For example,  '''123.45.56.89'''.

==What links here==
{{shortcut|WB:WLH}}

Within the Toolbox section on the left-hand side of every page is a link labeled &quot;'''What links here'''&quot;. This is used to see a list of the pages that [[WB:LINK|link]] to (or [[WB:REDIRECT|redirect]] to, or are included on the current page. These are sometimes referred to as ''backlinks''.

To use the tool, click [[Special:WhatLinksHere]] and type in the page title.

===Overview===
The &quot;What links here&quot; facility lists the pages on the same site (English Wikibooks) which link to (or redirect to, or [[#Transclusions|transclude]]) a given page. It is possible to limit the search to pages in a specified [[WB:NS|namespace]]. To see this information, click the &quot;What links here&quot; link while looking at any page. The list is sorted by date of creation of the page.

Pages redirected to the given page are marked &quot;redirect&quot;. Pages transcluding the given page are marked &quot;transclusion&quot;; for these pages it is not shown whether they also ''link'' to the given page. For image and other file pages, the pages using the image or file appear on the list and are marked &quot;image link&quot;. 

The list of links to a page is useful in a number of ways:
* The number of incoming links gives a rough indication of how important or popular a page is.
* Where the intended subject material of a page is unclear, the list of pages linking to it might provide useful context.

The function works even for a page title that does not exist (recording [[Help:Glossary#redlink|redlinks]] to that title). The &quot;What links here&quot; link appears on the edit page on which one arrives when following a broken link.

To invoke a &quot;What links here&quot; list directly (in the search box, browser address bar, or wikilinks) use the syntax [[Special:WhatLinksHere/John Smith]] (replacing &quot;John Smith&quot; with the desired target page title).

It is also possible to make a wikilink to the &quot;What links here&quot; list for a particular page; to do this type &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Special:WhatLinksHere/&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Page&amp;nbsp;name'']]&lt;/tt&gt;, replacing ''Page name'' with the title of the target page.

===Limitations===
The following links are ''not'' listed at &quot;What links here&quot;:
*automatically generated links from [[Help:Categories|categories]] to their subcategories and member pages (and vice versa)
*automatically generated links from [[Help:Editing#Subpage links|subpages]] to their parent pages
*links in [[WB:ES|edit summaries]]

In the case of links to [[WB:SECTION|sections]], the precise target is not shown. &quot;What links here&quot; cannot list the backlinks of a specific section only. (It may be possible to work around this by making a new title that redirects to a particular section, and encouraging people to make links to the redirect rather than the section.

Also note that if a page's links change due to a change in a [[Help:Templates|template]], the backlinks for that page are not updated immediately.

===Redirects===
The backlinks feature shows which backlinks are [[WB:REDIRECT|redirects]]. The backlinks of the redirect are also shown, and if they include a redirect, the backlinks of that also (not more). This makes it a useful tool for finding [[Help:Glossary#double redirect|double redirects]], which should generally be replaced by redirects to the final target. There are options to hide redirects, or to show only redirects (by hiding links and transclusions).

===Transclusions===
The backlinks list includes pages that include the current page using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{SOMEPAGE}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

It also includes links which exist on certain pages due to the transclusion of other pages (usually [[Help:Templates|templates]]). For example, if page A contains a transclusion of template B, and B contains a link to C, then the link to C will appear on page A, and A will be listed among the backlinks of C.

[[File:Transclusion-multiple-foo.svg|Tranclusion of template B onto pages A, P, and Q to display B's content, &quot;foo&quot; on each.]]

{{Wikibooks help}} {{TOC|limit=2}}

Media files such as images, audio, or video often provide an excellent compliment to brilliant prose. Just as with any content that you upload, the copyright status must be compatible for use at Wikibooks.  Please see [[Wikibooks:Media]] for our official licensing restrictions.
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot; /&gt;

=={{anchor|Uploading}}Uploading files==
{{shortcut|WB:UPLOAD}}

Typically the [[commons:First steps|first step]] in using an image or other media file is to [[Commons:Special:Upload|upload]] it to [[commons:|Wikimedia Commons]]. All files that qualify for use at Wikibooks are uploaded to Commons, with the exception of [[Wikibooks:Media#Non-free_use|fair use]] files, which must be [[Special:Upload|uploaded]] to the English Wikibooks instead. Many media files are copyrighted without permission to redistribute, and cannot be uploaded to either location. See [[Wikibooks:Media]] for details about which media files can be uploaded.  Files on Commons are available for any language version of any [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia]] project.

The preferred image formats are [[w:SVG|SVG]], [[w:Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[w:JPEG|JPEG]], and [[w:XCF (file format)|XCF]]. The preferred sound formats are [[w:Ogg|Ogg]] (using [[w:FLAC|FLAC]], [[w:Speex|Speex]], and [[w:Vorbis|Vorbis]] codecs) and [[w:MIDI|MIDI]]. Videos must be Ogg files using the [[w:Theora|Theora]] video codec.

Choose a good name for the media file before you upload it, as you cannot rename it later. Once the file is uploaded you should be able to read and make sense of its [[#File pages|file page]], which describes the file and lets readers see images in their original size.

Uploading a file to Commons is as simple as clicking ''upload file'' in the toolbox towards the bottom of the left-hand side menu (below the Wikibooks logo).

If you plan to upload to Wikibooks, follow the steps below. You must be [[Special:Userlogin|logged in]] and [[Wikibooks:Uploaders|have permission]] to upload files to Wikibooks.

# Visit [[Special:Upload|the local upload page]].
# Browse to the file's location on your computer by clicking the ''Browse'' button.
# Provide a name for the file if it is to be different than the name of the file as stored on your computer.
# Copy and paste the {{tl|information}} template and fill it in:
## Describe your file.
## Give the source of the file (preferably a [[w:URL|URL]]). If you took a screenshot, say so and indicate the software or website the screenshot represents.
## Provide the date the copyrighted work depicted was created or the date the copyrighted file itself was created.  If you are uploading a screenshot, this will be today's date instead.
## Provide the author of the work.  If the file is a screenshot of a copyrighted piece of software or website, provide the copyright owner.  '''This cannot be 
# Copy and paste the {{tl|non-free use rationale}} template and fill it in with:
## The page name where the file will be used.  A non-free file must have justification for '''each''' of its uses through separate non-free use templates.
## The copyright holder for the work depicted or the file itself.
## The source for the file; this will match the source in the information template above.
## Justification for why this non-free file must be used rather than any freely licensed alternatives.
## The purpose of this file and why it must be used for the book it is intended to illustrate.
# Choose the correct type of non-free media from the menu. This automatically inserts a [[Wikibooks:Templates/Files|tag]] such as {{tl|non-free&amp;nbsp;art}} or {{tl|non-free&amp;nbsp;stamp}}.

=={{anchor|File page}}File pages==
When a file such as an image, video, or sound clip is [[#Uploading files|uploaded]] to Wikibooks or the Wikimedia Commons an associated '''file page''' is created. The purpose of these pages is to provide information about the file, such as the author, date of creation, who uploaded the file, any modifications that may have been made, an extended description about the file's subject or context, where the file is used, and copyright information. In the case of an image, the file page shows a higher resolution version of the image, if available. To view the file page for an image or video, click on the image itself. For a sound file, click on the information icon, [[File:CrystalClearInfoIcon.png|link=]], near the sound clip link.

The description page consists of five parts:
*The file itself
*&quot;File summary&quot; - what the image is and is about as well as its origins. 
*&quot;File history&quot; - when a new version of a file is uploaded with the same name, the existing file is replaced and becomes available via file history. See [[Help:Tracking changes#Page history|page history]].
*&quot;File links&quot; - a list of pages that embed the file, either directly or through a [[Help:Templates|template]].
*&quot;Metadata&quot; (images only) - technical information about the file and the equipment used to create it (camera model etc.)

The following are example pages for different types of files:
*[[:File:Leucospermum cultivar Edit.jpg|Images]]
*[[:File:Russian national anthem at Medvedev inauguration 2008.ogg|Video]]
*[[:File:Edison cylinder Lost Chord.ogg|Sound]]
*[[:File:Abroad - 1882.djvu|Mixed content (DjVu or PDF)]]

==Using files==
This section explains how to insert pictures into Wikibooks pages using wikitext. It describes options for specifying placement, alternate text for screen readers, captions, sizes, and links, and contains advice about panoramas and avoiding image stackups.  The same syntax is used regardless of whether a file is from Wikibooks or Wikimedia Commons.

=== Thumbnails ===
A typical picture can be inserted with a line &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:...|thumb|...]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; as shown below. Using &quot;&lt;code&gt;thumb&lt;/code&gt;&quot; generates a thumbnail, a picture that is typically sized differently from the original image. Several options can affect a thumbnail's placement and size.

==== On the left ====
By default a thumbnail is floated to the right of the page, with the text flowing around it. However, the tall &quot;Wikibooks Help&quot; box on the right of this page might collide with a right-floating picture, so our first example specifies &quot;&lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, and just below it you can see what the resulting picture looks like:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|left|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|left|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]

The above text gives the image file name &quot;Wikipedesketch1.png&quot;, the image type &quot;thumb&quot; and alignment &quot;left&quot;, the alternative text &quot;A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.&quot;, and the caption &quot;The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.&quot; A Wikibooks reader can click on the thumbnail, or on the small double-rectangle icon [[File:Magnify-clip.png|link=|alt=]] below it, to see the corresponding file page which will let the user see the image in its original size.

Although the above text may appear in multiple lines for formatting purposes, the actual image text is on one line, as it uses spaces without any line breaks. The &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and the first &quot;&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;&quot; must be on the same line; other spaces and line breaks are ignored if they are next to &quot;&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;&quot; characters or just inside the brackets. Some parts of the image syntax, such as the &quot;&lt;code&gt;alt=&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, do not allow spaces or line breaks, and the easiest way to get it right is to omit unnecessary spaces and line breaks.

Alternative text (alt text) is intended for visually impaired readers. Often the caption or page will describe the image inadequately, and where this is the case you can write '''alt=caption''' or '''alt=see adjacent text'''. If additional alt text is added, it should be a succinct description. Unlike alt text, a caption can contain wiki markup like &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;''[[Using Wikibooks]]''&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. The caption text is placed underneath the picture. 

Here's the same example again, this time in the context of some colored [[w:lorem ipsum|lorem ipsum]] dummy text with asterisks (*) showing where the image syntax appears in the text:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|left|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|left|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|2}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{-}}

==== On the right ====
The default placement for a thumbnail is on the right:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|2}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

==== Without flowing text ====
Although most thumbnails are combined with flowing text and are placed to the right or left, you can also place a thumbnail without text flowing around it. One way is to center it, using &quot;&lt;code&gt;center&lt;/code&gt;&quot;:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|center|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|center|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;

You can also place the picture to the left, without flowing text, using &quot;&lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;&quot;:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|none|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|none|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;

==== Thumbnail sizes ====
Normally a thumbnail has a width of 220 [[w:pixels|pixels]] (px). This width is used by typical readers, who have not logged in or who have not changed their preferences. You can set a different default width for yourself in ''[[Special:Preferences|My preferences]]'' under &quot;Appearance:Files&quot;. The options are 120px, 150px, 180px, 200px, 220px, 250px, and 300px. Any image narrower than the preferred width is displayed at the narrower width.

The default behavior can make a tall, thin picture come out too large. For example:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Amun.svg|thumb|alt=Full-length profile of man in ancient Egyptian clothing. He has red-brown skin and wears a helmet with tall yellow plumes.|The Egyptian god Amun, portrayed before the Amarna period]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Amun.svg|thumb|alt=Full-length profile of man in ancient Egyptian clothing. He has red-brown skin and wears a helmet with tall yellow plumes.|The Egyptian god Amun, portrayed before the Amarna period]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|4}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

; Upright images
The &quot;&lt;code&gt;upright&lt;/code&gt;&quot; option can help fix this by informing the Wikibooks layout system that the image should have a narrower width than usual:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Amun.svg|thumb|upright|alt=Full-length profile of man in ancient Egyptian clothing. He has red-brown skin and wears a helmet with tall yellow plumes.|The Egyptian god Amun, portrayed before the Amarna period]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Amun.svg|thumb|upright|alt=Full-length profile of man in ancient Egyptian clothing. He has red-brown skin and wears a helmet with tall yellow plumes.|The Egyptian god Amun, portrayed before the Amarna period]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|4}}&lt;/span&gt;

The &quot;&lt;code&gt;upright&lt;/code&gt;&quot; option normally creates an image that is about 75% of the width of the default. The exact width is computed by starting with the default thumbnail width, multiplying it by 0.75, and rounding to the nearest multiple of 10. Normally the default width is 220px so an upright image is 170px wide; changing one's default width within the range from 120px to 300px results in upright image widths ranging from 90px to 230px.
{{clear}}

; Shrinking upright images further
If the upright factor 0.75 is too large or too small, it can be specified explicitly. A factor of 1.0 uses the default thumbnail width, which is the same as not specifying &quot;&lt;code&gt;upright&lt;/code&gt;&quot; at all; a factor less than or greater than 1.0 creates an image smaller or larger than the default. For example:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Amun.svg|thumb|upright=0.56|alt=Full-length profile of man in ancient Egyptian clothing. He has red-brown skin and wears a helmet with tall yellow plumes.|The Egyptian god Amun, portrayed before the Amarna period]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Amun.svg|thumb|upright=0.56|alt=Full-length profile of man in ancient Egyptian clothing. He has red-brown skin and wears a helmet with tall yellow plumes.|The Egyptian god Amun, portrayed before the Amarna period]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|3}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

; Short, wide images
Short, wide images sometimes benefit from &quot;&lt;code&gt;upright&lt;/code&gt;&quot; factors greater than 1.0. Factors greater than about 2.5 can generate large images that cause problems with some browsers. Although many image types, such as [[w:JPEG|JPEG]] and [[w:Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], do not handle enlargement well, [[w:SVG|SVG]] images have no problem with it. For example:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Köppen-vereinfacht.svg|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=Map of the world. A tan band stretches from northern Africa through central China; most of Australia and parts of south Africa and the western Americas are also tan. Dark greens dominate the northern hemisphere. Lighter greens cover much land near the equator. Polar areas are white, the north fringed with light blue.|Macroclimates of the earth. Tans represent desert, dark greens humid continental, and light green tropical rainforest. Light blue and white represent tundra and ice cap.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Köppen-vereinfacht.svg|thumb|center|upright=2.0|alt=Map of the world. A tan band stretches from northern Africa through central China; most of Australia and parts of south Africa and the western Americas are also tan. Dark greens dominate the northern hemisphere. Lighter greens cover much land near the equator. Polar areas are white, the north fringed with light blue.|Macroclimates of the earth. Tans represent desert, dark greens humid continental, and light green tropical rainforest. Light blue and white represent tundra and ice cap.]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|2}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

; Width in pixels
You can also display an image of a specified width. Typically, if you specify a width in pixels, it should be at least 300px. Widths greater than about 550px may cause problems with some browsers, as stated above.

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Köppen-vereinfacht.svg|thumb|center|400px|alt=Map of the world. A tan band stretches from northern Africa through central China; most of Australia and parts of south Africa and the western Americas are also tan. Dark greens dominate the northern hemisphere. Lighter greens cover much land near the equator. Polar areas are white, the north fringed with light blue.|Macroclimates of the earth. Tans represent desert, dark greens humid continental, and light green tropical rainforest. Light blue and white represent tundra and ice cap.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
[[File:Köppen-vereinfacht.svg|thumb|center|400px|alt=Map of the world. A tan band stretches from northern Africa through central China; most of Australia and parts of south Africa and the western Americas are also tan. Dark greens dominate the northern hemisphere. Lighter greens cover much land near the equator. Polar areas are white, the north fringed with light blue.|Macroclimates of the earth. Tans represent desert, dark greens humid continental, and light green tropical rainforest. Light blue and white represent tundra and ice cap.]]

; Height in pixels
To specify the exact height of a picture, letting the width scale to match, prefix the height with &quot;&lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. The following example resizes the image to a height of 60px:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|center|x60px|alt=White diagonal cross over blue background|Flag of Scotland]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|center|x60px|alt=White diagonal cross over blue background|Flag of Scotland]]

; Width or height in pixels, whichever makes the image smaller

If you specify both width and height of a picture, it is sized to whichever value would make it smaller. This will cause a picture to fit in a certain area, regardless of the image's actual size. Since the proportions of [[:File:Flag of Scotland.svg]] are 5×3, specifying a width of 120px generates a 120×72px image, and specifying a height of 60px generates a 100×60px image, so a size field of &quot;&lt;code&gt;120x60px&lt;/code&gt;&quot; generates the smaller of the two, namely, the 100×60px image:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|center|120x60px|alt=White diagonal cross over blue background|Flag of Scotland]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|center|120x60px|alt=White diagonal cross over blue background|Flag of Scotland]]

; Pixel counts vs. upright factors

Although pixel counts are easier to understand than upright factors, they adjust less well to user preferences. For example, suppose a picture contains some detail and by default is a bit too small, and you want to grow it by about 10%. Although &quot;&lt;code&gt;upright=1.1&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;240px&lt;/code&gt;&quot; do the job equally well for the common case where the default width is 220 pixels, many of the users who set the default width to 300 pixels to work better with their high-resolution screens will be annoyed with &quot;&lt;code&gt;200px&lt;/code&gt;&quot; because it will make the picture a third smaller than their preferred size. In contrast, &quot;&lt;code&gt;upright=1.1&lt;/code&gt;&quot; will display the picture to them with a width of 330 pixels, and this is more likely to work well on their displays.

Pixel counts are typically better than upright factors for displaying combinations of pictures, some of which have known and limited sizes, and for displaying tiny icons that are intended to be combined with text.

; Native size
Replacing &quot;&lt;code&gt;thumb&lt;/code&gt;&quot; with &quot;&lt;code&gt;frame&lt;/code&gt;&quot; causes the image to be displayed in its native size, that is, the size that it was originally uploaded with. For example:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|frame|center|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|frame|center|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]

==== Panoramas ====
Very large pictures should not be put directly into books, as they cause problems in some browser environments. Images wider than 550px or so are often better treated as a panorama, which can be created with the {{tl|wide image}} template. For example:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{wide image|Helsinki z00.jpg|1800px|alt=Panorama of city with mixture of five- to ten-story buildings|Helsinki has many buildings.}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
{{wide image|Helsinki z00.jpg|1800px|alt=Panorama of city with mixture of five- to ten-story buildings|Helsinki has many buildings.}}

==== DjVu and PDF files ====
[[File:Abroad - 1882.djvu|thumb|right|150px|By Thomas Crane|page=13]]
[[File:Cinderella (1865).pdf|thumb|left|150px|This is page 2|page=2]]

Images can be excerpted from [[w:DjVu|DjVu]] or [[w:Portable Document Format|PDF]] files, with an optional ''page'' parameter. For example:
: &lt;small&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Abroad - 1882.djvu|thumb|right|150px|By Thomas Crane|page=13]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
: &lt;small&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Cinderella (1865).pdf|thumb|left|150px|This is page 2|page=2]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Avoiding stack-ups ===
One of the problems many users of floating pictures hit is that multiple pictures sometimes stack up vertically, particularly with large screens and wide images. For example, in many browsers the two pictures at the right of this text stack up awkwardly.

[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]
[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|alt=White diagonal cross over blue background|Flag of Scotland]]
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

Often the best solution to this is simply to add more text, as is done below, but this sometimes is not possible. The following subsections show some other possible solutions to the problem.

[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|3}}&lt;/span&gt;
[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|alt=White diagonal cross over blue background|Flag of Scotland]]
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|2}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

==== Alternating left and right ====
Perhaps the easiest way is to handle multiple floating pictures is to alternate them left then right; this way they do not come into contact with one another, and so cannot stack up in an unattractive way. This has a disadvantage, though: people with very low [[w:screen resolution|screen resolution]]s (such as those using [[w:PDA|PDA]]s or [[w:netbook|netbook]]s) may find the result too awkward, albeit still readable.

[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Myriapoda]]''.]]
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|2}}&lt;/span&gt;
[[File:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb|left|alt=White diagonal cross over blue background|Flag of Scotland]]
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|2}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

==== Co-aligning ====
It is common to have two pictures that logically should be grouped together. The {{tl|multiple image}} template is one way to do this. For example:

{{multiple image
 | width     = 100
 | footer    = Two cards used by football referees
 | image1    = Yellow card.svg
 | alt1      = Yellow card
 | caption1  = Caution
 | image2    = Red card.svg
 | alt2      = Red card
 | caption2  = Ejection
}}
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;
  {{multiple image
   | width     = 100
   | footer    = Two cards used by football referees
   | image1    = Yellow card.svg
   | alt1      = Yellow card
   | caption1  = Caution
   | image2    = Red card.svg
   | alt2      = Red card
   | caption2  = Ejection
  }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{clear}}

The same template can also align pictures vertically:

{{multiple image
 | direction = vertical
 | width     = 100
 | footer    = Two cards used by football referees
 | image1    = Yellow card.svg
 | alt1      = Yellow card
 | caption1  = Caution
 | image2    = Red card.svg
 | alt2      = Red card
 | caption2  = Ejection
}}
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;
  {{multiple image
   | direction = vertical
   | width     = 100
   | footer    = Two cards used by football referees
   | image1    = Yellow card.svg
   | alt1      = Yellow card
   | caption1  = Caution
   | image2    = Red card.svg
   | alt2      = Red card
   | caption2  = Ejection
  }}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{{clear}}

==== Galleries ====
A gallery displays several pictures in an array or similar layout.  Perhaps the most flexible method is [[Help:Tables|table syntax]]. For example:

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;
{|
| [[File:Philipp Veit 008.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Robed woman, seated, with sword on her lap|Philipp Veit, ''Germania'', 1834–36]]
| [[File:Image Germania (painting).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Robed woman, standing, holding a sword|Philipp Veit, ''Germania'', 1848]]
| [[File:Niederwald memorial 2.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Monument of robed woman, standing, holding a crown in one hand and a partly sheathed sword in another|Johannes Schilling, ''Germania'', 1871–83]]
|}
&lt;/pre&gt;
{|
| [[File:Philipp Veit 008.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Robed woman, seated, with sword on her lap|Philipp Veit, ''Germania'', 1834–36]]
| [[File:Image Germania (painting).jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Robed woman, standing, holding a sword|Philipp Veit, ''Germania'', 1848]]
| [[File:Niederwald memorial 2.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=Monument of robed woman, standing, holding a crown in one hand and a partly sheathed sword in another|Johannes Schilling, ''Germania'', 1871–83]]

There are other ways to make a gallery. One simple way is the {{tag|gallery}} tag using the [[File:Vector toolbar insert picture gallery button.png|alt=gallery button|link=]] button in the [[Help:Editing#Edit toolbar|edit toolbar]] above the editing text box. 


&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Wiki.png
File:Wiki.png|Captioned
File:Wiki.png
File:Wiki.png|[[Help:Editing#Links|Links]] can be put in captions.
File:Wiki.png
File:Wiki.png|Full [[MediaWiki]]&lt;br /&gt;''syntax'' may be used&amp;hellip;
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Which produces:

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Wiki.png
File:Wiki.png|Captioned
File:Wiki.png
File:Wiki.png|[[Help:Editing#Links|Links]] can be put in captions.
File:Wiki.png
File:Wiki.png|Full [[MediaWiki]]&lt;br /&gt;''syntax'' may be used&amp;hellip;  
&lt;/gallery&gt;

The extended syntax is (see ''[[m:Help:Images and other uploaded files#Gallery|gallery tag help]]'' and below for full list of parameters):

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;gallery caption=&quot;Sample gallery&quot; widths=&quot;180px&quot; heights=&quot;120px&quot; perrow=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
File:Wiki.png|Caption text.
[...]
&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

* Images are separated by new lines.
* Captions are optional.
* Notice that there are no brackets except for links within captions.
* The default width and height is 120px.


Unfortunately, the gallery tag does not support alternate text, so it generates pages that are not accessible to visually impaired and other readers who cannot see the images.  This can be overcome with the {{tl|gallery}} template:

{{pre|scroll|&lt;nowiki&gt;{{gallery

==== Forcing a break ====
As a final resort, you can force the browser to insert a break, making all text and pictures appear below the bottom of the first picture using {{tl|clear}}. This can produce rather unattractive gaps, particularly in the accompanying text. Remember that text will flow and wrap differently for other users, based on their chosen browser, screen resolution, default font size, accessibility options, number of toolbars and sidebars (such as instant messaging panes) and more. Do not force page design just so that it looks pretty on ''your'' display. Hack only where absolutely necessary. Wherever possible, just use the simplest logical page flow.

[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|thumb|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Using Wikibooks]]''.]]
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}
[[Image:Flag of Scotland.svg|thumb||alt=White diagonal cross over blue background|Flag of Scotland]]
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

=== Plain pictures ===
Most pictures in pages are thumbnails, but sometimes more specialized needs require finer grained control. A plain picture with no formatting can be inserted with:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

In this plain picture the text &quot;&lt;code&gt;A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.&lt;/code&gt;&quot; is not visible as a caption. Instead, it appears as the title text of the image, commonly displayed as a [[w:tooltip|tooltip]] during a [[w:mouseover|mouseover]]. In a thumbnail the alt text defaults to empty, but a plain picture's alt text defaults to its title text if given and to the picture's file name if not; this default can be overridden with an explicit &quot;&lt;code&gt;alt=''Alt text''&lt;/code&gt;&quot; option. Title text, like alt text, will ignore any Wiki markup.

A plain picture can be placed anywhere in the page, and acts as a big character in the text, so that nearby text does not float or wrap around it. For example:

&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;

* ''Note:'' To achieve a plain image with a caption, one can use {{tl|plain image with caption}}. The caption is automatically added as the image's title and alt text, and any wiki markup used on it will be correctly displayed on the caption, but will be automatically stripped down from the alt and title text. See an example [[w:Jeremias Falck|here]].
{{clear}}

==== Plain picture sizes ====
A plain picture defaults to the image's native size. This can be overridden with an explicit size. For example:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Image:Wikipedesketch1.png|50px|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|50px|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

The &quot;&lt;code&gt;frameless&lt;/code&gt;&quot; option causes a plain picture to default to the same size as a thumbnail. [[#Thumbnail sizes|As with thumbnails]], the default can be adjusted with the &quot;&lt;code&gt;upright=''factor''&lt;/code&gt;&quot; option. If you use the common default of 220 pixels for thumbnail widths, the following example image's width will be 220 × 0.2 pixels, which rounds to 40 pixels:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Amun.svg|frameless|upright=0.2|alt=Full-length profile of man in ancient Egyptian clothing. He has red-brown skin and wears a helmet with tall yellow plumes.|The Egyptian god Amun, portrayed before the Amarna period]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Amun.svg|frameless|upright=0.2|alt=Full-length profile of man in ancient Egyptian clothing. He has red-brown skin and wears a helmet with tall yellow plumes.|The Egyptian god Amun, portrayed before the Amarna period]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

==== Border ====
The &quot;&lt;code&gt;border&lt;/code&gt;&quot; option adds a one-pixel border, which can be useful when it is important to distinguish image from background. Here is the same picture with and without a border.

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Flag of Japan.svg|border|30px|White flag containing solid red circle]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Flag of Japan.svg|30px|White flag containing solid red circle]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

This generates {{nowrap|&quot;[[File:Flag of Japan.svg|border|30px|White flag containing solid red circle]] [[File:Flag of Japan.svg|30px|White flag containing solid red circle]]&quot;}}.

==== Horizontal placement ====
Like thumbnails, plain pictures can be floated left or right with text flowing around them; or centered or put left without text flow. The only difference is that the &quot;&lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;&quot; parameter is required to float a plain picture to the right, whereas floating right is the default for thumbnails. For example:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|right|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum}}&lt;/span&gt;*[[File:Wikipedesketch1.png|right|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]*&lt;span style=&quot;color:#996633&quot;&gt;{{Lorem ipsum|2}}&lt;/span&gt;
{{clear}}

==== Vertical alignment ====
When a plain picture appears in text, it is aligned so that its vertical middle is roughly where the center of a lower-case &quot;x&quot; would be; if the image is larger than the line is tall, it sticks out both above and below. The vertical alignment syntax provides several options to adjust this. For example, the &quot;&lt;code&gt;baseline&lt;/code&gt;&quot; option:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;X[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|baseline|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]X&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

generates &quot;{{nowrap|X[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|baseline|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]X}}&quot; instead of the default &quot;{{nowrap|X[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]X}}&quot;. Available options for vertical alignment, next to the output that they generate, are
{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;baseline[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|baseline|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]&lt;/code&gt;}},
{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;middle[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|middle|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]&lt;/code&gt;}} (the default),
{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;sub[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|sub|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]&lt;/code&gt;}},
{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;super[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|super|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]&lt;/code&gt;}},
{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;text-top[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|text-top|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]&lt;/code&gt;}},
{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;text-bottom[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|text-bottom|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]&lt;/code&gt;}},
{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;top[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|top|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]&lt;/code&gt;}}, and
{{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;bottom[[File:Flag of Hungary vertical.svg|bottom|7px|Vertical version of horizontal tricolor flag (red, white, green)]]&lt;/code&gt;}}.

===={{anchor|Link}}Links ====
Normally a picture links to its image page, which describes the image, who created it, and links to the original image at full resolution. You can create a plain picture that links to some other location by using the &quot;&lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt;&quot; option.

To link to some other page, specify its name in the link option along with an appropriate caption that hints to readers what will happen if they click on the link. This caption serves both as title text for the tooltip, and as alt text for visually disabled readers. For example, &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Flag of France.svg|20px|link=French|France]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; generates a flag [[File:Flag of France.svg|20px|link=French|France]] that links to the book ''[[French]]''.

To link to an external site, specify its URL in the link option along with an appropriate caption. For example, &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Flag of Belgium.svg|20px|link=http://www.belgium.be/en/|Belgium government portal]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; generates a flag [[File:Flag of Belgium.svg|20px|link=http://www.belgium.be/en/|Belgium government portal]] that links to the English-language portal of the Belgian government.

A purely decorative image, which conveys no information and does nothing when it is clicked on, can be specified with an empty alt attribute. For example &quot;&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Flag of the United States.svg|20px|link=|alt=]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&quot; generates a flag [[File:Flag of the United States.svg|20px|link=|alt=]] that is purely decorative.

==== Image maps ====
&lt;imagemap&gt;
File:Bryan-Sewall.jpg|300px|right|alt=1896 Democratic campaign poster with nominees William J. Bryan of Nebraska for President and Arthur Sewall of Maine for Vice President
circle 950 850 700 [[w:William Jennings Bryan|William J. Bryan]]
circle 2950 850 700 [[w:Arthur Sewall|Arthur Sewall]]
default [http://projects.vassar.edu/1896/democrats.html 1896 Democrats]
&lt;/imagemap&gt;
You can link different parts of an image to different locations using an [[mw:Extension:ImageMap|image map]]. For example, in the image at right, clicking a circle roughly corresponding to the left portrait takes the reader to ''[[w:William Jennings Bryan|William Jennings Bryan]]'', clicking the right portrait goes to ''[[w:Arthur Sewall|Arthur Sewall]]'', and clicking anywhere else goes to &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://projects.vassar.edu/1896/democrats.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. This image is generated by the following markup:

&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;
&lt;imagemap&gt;
File:Bryan-Sewall.jpg|300px|right|alt=1896 Democratic campaign poster with nominees William J. Bryan of Nebraska for President and Arthur Sewall of Maine for Vice President
circle 950 850 700 [[w:William Jennings Bryan|William J. Bryan]]
circle 2950 850 700 [[w:Arthur Sewall|Arthur Sewall]]
default [http://projects.vassar.edu/1896/democrats.html 1896 Democrats]
&lt;/imagemap&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This imagemap markup specifies that the title text (tooltips) for the three regions are &quot;William J. Bryan&quot;, &quot;Arthur Sewall&quot;, and &quot;1896 Democrats&quot;, respectively. The alt text for an imagemap region is always the same as its title text; the alt text for the overall image is given in the first line of the imagemap's markup. The underlying image's native dimensions are 3916×1980, and the coordinates are given in these dimensions rather than in the 300px resizing. As described in the [[mw:Extension:ImageMap|image map documentation]], regions can be specified as circles, rectangles, and arbitrary polygons, and the blue &quot;i&quot; icon [[File:Desc-20.png|x14px|link=|alt=]] can be moved or suppressed. Also, the image can be specified as a &quot;&lt;code&gt;thumb&lt;/code&gt;&quot; or &quot;&lt;code&gt;frame&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, which means it has alt text and a caption in the usual way, with a double-rectangle icon [[File:Magnify-clip.png|link=|alt=]] instead of the blue &quot;i&quot; icon [[File:Desc-20.png|x14px|link=|alt=]].

=== Linking without displaying ===
Let us say you want to link to the picture without displaying it. You can take the reader to the image page, where it tells them who uploaded it, when, what the copyright status is, etc.:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[:File:Wikipedesketch1.png]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: [[:File:Wikipedesketch1.png]]

You can make the link say anything you want.

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[:File:Wikipedesketch1.png|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: [[:File:Wikipedesketch1.png|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]

When the link is clicked the image is displayed with other text information at a reasonable size. The user can click through the resulting medium-sized image to get to the full size highest resolution image.

You can also send the user directly to the image:

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Media:Wikipedesketch1.png]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: [[Media:Wikipedesketch1.png]]

This says &quot;&lt;code&gt;Media:&lt;/code&gt;&quot; instead of &quot;&lt;code&gt;File:&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. When the user clicks on the link, the browser goes directly to the image. As before, you can change the text so it says anything you want.

: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Media:Wikipedesketch1.png|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: [[Media:Wikipedesketch1.png|A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.]]

This can be awkward if the image is quite large, for the full size image will be displayed when the user clicks the link.

Finally, you can link to one image from a thumbnail's small double-rectangle icon [[File:Magnify-clip.png|link=|alt=]], but display another image using &quot;{{para|thumb|&lt;var&gt;Displayed image name&lt;/var&gt;}}&quot;. This is intended for the rare cases when the Wikibooks software that reduces images to thumbnails does a poor job, and you want to provide your own thumbnail. In the following example, the double-rectangle links to ''[[:File:Anime stub.svg]]'' but the image displayed is ''[[:File:Anime stub.png]]'':

[[File:Anime stub.svg|thumb=Anime stub.png|alt=Head of cute girl, manga-style, with blue hair, big eyes and smile, and gray puzzle pieces below and around her hair|Putting the puzzle together]]
: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Anime stub.svg|thumb=Anime stub.png|alt=Head of cute girl, manga-style, with blue hair, big eyes and smile, and gray puzzle pieces below and around her hair|Putting the puzzle together]]

Although I'm not a bureaucrat here, I've made [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] a sysop using my [[m:steward|steward]] access. This is because your only bureaucrat is away and a request was made at [[m:requests for permissions|requests for permissions]] following a successful vote for Gentgeen here.  [[User:Angela|Angela]] 00:25, 9 Aug 2004 (UTC)

User:Dysprosia seems to be following an agenda of occasional time wasting by deleting material or suggesting material for deletion that is being developed or serves a useful though minority interest. What is the process for limiting or curtailing his nonsense? Surely he can be encouraged to do more useful and constructive work which he is clearly capable of? [[User:82.69.58.117|82.69.58.117]] 20:44, 7 Oct 2004 (UTC)

I feel that I am being harassed by [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] for quite a number of reasons. For the first reason, please see my entry on VfU.

My IP was blocked by Gentgeen with no warning and no citation of policy, and for no apparent reason. When I asked him why, he said &quot;Because you, editing anonymously at the time, deleted an anonymous user's nomination on VfD&quot;. Last time I checked this is not a violation of Wikibooks policy. He was also initially hesitant to remove the block, until I made it clear I wasn't going to just give it a rest until it expired hours later (I wanted to add to a VfD debate, which was to end just hours later, the same VfD debate Gentgeen's decision regarding which I have mentioned at VfU I find irresponsible). I even asked him for other policy justifications, and he could give me none.

I also object to his unnessecarily hostile attitude towards me, beginning at VfD, and most recently on IRC (after a while, I couldn't take it anymore and I exploded and was extremely hostile for perhaps 30 seconds.), during which I said &quot;your mother is a policy&quot; which he later gave as one of two reasons for not continuing discussion with me. In fact, he said his mother is an ISO expert and has authored plenty of policies, and at the time did not appear to take offence to my attempt to let anger out without being unnessecarily agressive (which later failed, as I noted above).

In addition, I believe he has no respect for the fact that experienced users don't just appear, they start as newcomers. He repeatedly said hostile things to me about how Wikibooks is not Wikipedia (which is extremely obvious), how Wikibooks policy differs from Wikipedia policy (why wouldn't it?), and how Wikipedians are to be 'handled' more rashly than Wikibooksians.

In fact, regarding what he said about validity of the &quot;kenbuloga&quot; recipe (my existing response nonwithstanding), I have this to say: In a Google for &quot;Wikibooks is not Wikipedia&quot;, a policy which was unilaterally written, voted on, and implemented by him and only him, turns up only a handful of pages, all of which are Gentgeen telling others (sometimes hostily) that &quot;Wikibooks is not Wikipedia&quot;.

While I would hesitate to say that Gentgeen is a bad admin or a &quot;rogue sysop&quot; (in fact, since the latter is used almost exclusively by known trolls and banned users, chances are I'd not use it at all in serious discourse), I do not think his conduct in these situations was appropriate and I would like to see it rectified.

--[[User:Node ue|Node ue]] 22:55, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)

* In fact, the &quot;keep&quot; votes for [[Cookbook:Special brownies]] (a debate in which I didn't much participate) greatly outnumbered the votes for &quot;delete&quot;, 9-4. It was extremely irresponsible of Gentgeen to 1. remove it from this page and 2. delete the article, without further discussion of which votes should be counted, and which should not, especially since he himself had voted &quot;delete&quot;. --[[User:Node ue|Node ue]] 23:15, 21 Oct 2004 (UTC)

* I agree, I believe gentgeen has abused his adminship.  He deletes pages with a total disregard for wikibooks policy and calls vital anon members of the wikibooks community &quot;sockpuppets&quot; and declares their votes null.  He puts his own agenda over the people's, and deletes pages with 20 Keep - 6 delete votes.  Also, in order to make groups look bad, he will spam pages (see the main page's history).  He used an anon account to make the keep side of a book look bad.  This is absolutely unacceptable for an admin that everyone looks up too, and should be dealt with accordingly.  Revoke his adminship. [[User:Jm51|Jm51]] 22:04, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)
: Gentgeen did ''not'' delete Beating Season. I did. Check the logs, please. I counted the votes 8 delete to 2 keep, amongst logged in users. It is Wikipedia policy to disregard anonymous votes in VfD and I have implemented this policy here also. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 22:06, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)
::it wasn't in the logs.  This is wikibooks, not wikipedia.  Nowhere in the wikibooks policy does it say anon users votes are null.  Furthermore, he spammed and vandalized the main page to make the &quot;keep&quot; side look bad.  That's just plain wrong.  [[User:Jm51|Jm51]] 23:30, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Apparently the admins around here disregard policy for to make life harder for the normal users or sockpuppets, as you'd rather call us.  As for genteen.  See [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Wikibooks:Votes_for_deletion&amp;oldid=84881 here].  He made the name &quot;thetruth&quot; to make the keep side look bad.  later, when helpful anonymous user 67.118.3.163 accused gentgeen of posting that (&quot;Oh, that's real productive. Gentgreen. stop posting that crap annon. to make the &quot;KEEP&quot; side look bad. pathetic.&quot;) gentgeen had no defense.  Despite's gentgeen's strong effort to make the keep side look bad, they were still garnering enough votes to justify keeping the book (22 - 4 or something?), gentgeen realized he had to really make the book look bad.  Enter his new ip 67.115.107.84.  In order for wikibookians to be so outraged to vote against beating season, gentgeen made the main page look something like [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Main_Page&amp;oldid=85507 this].  Also, as 67.115.107.84, he vandalized a bunch of user pages, added some rambling &quot;keep side arguments&quot; (to make others see the keep side is destructive) and even his own (to make reinforce the impression it was a wacko on the keep side) (see his [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&amp;target=67.115.107.84 trail of destruction]).  When confronted with this in the [[Wikibooks:Votes for undeletion]], gentgeen dodges the issue, just like when 67.118.3.163 confronted him.  Coincidence?  No way.  Gentgeen has a total disregard for policy and will stop at nothing to delete a page he believes should be deleted and will stop at nothing - disfranchising anon voters, spamming and vandalising the main page, faking votes.

== Counting VFD votes? ==

I have a procedural question for the more seasoned administrators: Which votes should be counted for VfD? For example, would an unlogged in user (just recorded as an IP) count? This would seem undesirable because someone could repeatedly use a dial-in account to get dozens of different IPs. Further, there's the sock-puppet problem when user accounts are made that have no signifigant contributions behind them.

(Obviously if a non-logged in user provides cogent, compelling arguments in favor for or against deleting that could help persuade people, so such users are not completely left out of the process.)

Thanks, --[[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 23:38, 17 Jan 2005 (UTC).
:I think anon users with different ip ranges are valid.  for example if the ips are from different netblocks, etc. they are obviously different people.
::Obviously? Someone could use dial-up, plus DSL, plus work or school to get plenty of IPs. Or, ask friends to do so. (But I guess you know all about this?) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 00:24, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)
:::Standard procedure on many Wikimedia projects is that only logged in users may vote.  If a user wants to participate in community processes, they should join the community. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 00:28, 18 Jan 2005 (UTC)

==Time limits for Admins==

This is a request for a policy change here on Wikibooks, and I am starting this discussion to make this &quot;official&quot;, as suggested by Aya on [[Wikibooks:Requests for adminship]].

The argument I'm trying to make is that being an admin on Wikibooks is not something to take lightly.  If you want to serve as an admin, you should be active not only as an editor/author here on Wikibooks, but also well versed and understanding of the policies here as well.  The admin is an enforcement position that the primary power is the ability to delete content from the public side of the Wikimedia project they have been appointed to oversee, as well as the power to &quot;protect&quot; pages from being edited, mainly to avoid vandalism and to &quot;cool off&quot; edit wars.

I am requesting to establish a &quot;time limit&quot; for how long an admin can be formally listed as an admin if they are no longer active in either their duties as an admin or even as an editor/author here on Wikibooks.  Essentially the wording should be something such as the following:

::''Being appointed as a Wikibooks administrator is not a lifetime appointment.  If you are not actively involved with being an author/editor of Wikibooks for more than one full calendar year, it will be assumed that you no longer want to be involved directly with Wikibooks as an administrator.  Circumstances in life may make it difficult to be as actively involved in Wikibooks as you may have been when you were nominated as an admin, and don't take the fact that you have been removed from administration status as a personal insult.  If you have your administrator status removed in this manner, you are still free to become an admin again in the future if you become active again, but it would have to go through a formal nomination/voting process like the first time you were nominated.  If you see that you are going to be gone from Wikibooks for an extended period of time, it is also encouraged that you voluntarily request that your admin status be removed.  Your Wikibooks user account will still be active, and this does not affect your ability to come back and edit content.''

I can think of a number of reasons why administrators in this circumstance should be removed.  The #1 reason above all is in the unfortunate circumstance when the user password database is compromised and some vandal decides that normal screwing up Wikibooks is not sufficient.  Instead they go on a wild rampage and start vandalising/protecting the vandalism, deleting random content, and otherwise making a mess of an admin account (including banning other admins or other forms of mischief).  It could get really ugly if one of these inactive admins has their account compromised.  Active administrators are much more likely to catch it if somebody else is using their account.

:This requires a definition of &quot;active&quot; that is something like &quot;edited in the last 48 hours&quot;. For anything else, the wild rampage will be stopped by a developer (via ssh into the server -- the other admins would be blocked) long before the admin discovers that his account has been abused. Since the admin wouldn't have access to his own account anyway, the only advantage of a (very) active admin would be that he might quickly send an email to the mailing list. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:59, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

The other issue is that ordinary Wikibookians need to know who to turn to for assistance to help protect/unprotect modules for various reasons, or even to know who some &quot;experienced users&quot; are that can be trusted to give advise in terms of editorial content.  Nothing is more frustrating than trying to contact an administrator and getting no answer.  If this apathy is simply because the admin hasn't been showing up to read the requests, they are not doing their job that they have offered.  If you don't want the pressures of being an administrator, it should be simple to request that your status as an admin be removed.  You are still able to edit content and help build Wikibooks, and there are many roles that people can take on (including mentoring) that don't require administrator status.

If you are looking for precedence, why don't you [[meta:Meta:Administrators|look at the policies on Meta]] for admins ''on'' Meta.  This was more along the lines of what I thought we ought to adopt here, but I don't think we need to be quite so harsh.  They have a specific requirement for a number of edits that I don't think is so reasonable, as it will encourage somebody to do a whole bunch of meaningless edits just to inflate the numbers.  I would rather that somebody show that they have done some meaningful contributions to Wikibooks, but that determination is a part of the voting process and the evaluation that each user voting for/against the admin.

Yes, Wikipedia has the following statement:
:There have also been a number of policy proposals to revoke adminship from user accounts of people who no longer participate in the project. These proposals have lacked widespread support.

An interesting alternative to look at [[wikisource:Wikisource:Administrator|is on Wikisource]], where they list the inactive admins more as admins Emeritus.  They still have &quot;sysop&quot; privileges, but it is clear that they are not active users and that anybody asking them for help should go elsewhere.

:Rather than splitting the list in two, simply order the list. Ordering by most recent edit is reasonable, though something predictive of future edits would be better. (example: an admin who edits every weekend should rise in rank as the weekend approaches) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:59, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

::I don't think that kind of level of information is really needed. It sure is a lot of bits of information, but all we really need is 1-bit (2 bits max) instead of a moving log-n number of bits. I.e., we just need to know &quot;active/not active&quot;. After that, it's not a popularity contest. If Alice has 315 edits per week, she's in the same class as Bob who has 400 edits per week. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:07, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

::: Erm. I case you hadn't noticed, I'd already split the lists when I added in Albert. I've just arbitrarily defined anyone who hasn't made an edit for over a month to be inactive. Anything more complex ought to be written in software. We can file a feature request to bugzilla.wikimedia.org if need be, but I think that ought to suffice for now. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:13, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

[[wikt:Wiktionary:Administrators/Former|Wikitionary has another interesting policy]] that is also somewhat similar to what I'm proposing, and had two admins that were de-sysop'd.

[[commons:Commons:Administrators#Inactive admins|Commons has still another policy]] that in this case is modeled after Meta, and has a 6 month inactivity period instead.

[[wikiquote:Wikiquote:Administrators|WIkiquote is another one]] that lists all admins, but has an Emeritus status of sorts for inactive admins.

I know this isn't a &quot;burning&quot; issue, but for Wikibooks in particular there has been an issue with a perception that all is well because there were a bunch of admins that were able to take care of everything, and that no more were needed.  I know that you broke that logjam, Aya, but at the same time arguments for/against creating new admins were based on the number of admins already on Wikibooks.  A policy of removing sysop status due to inactivity can show that there is a more &quot;pressing need&quot; for admins if (heaven forbid) we get into a situation like we had earlier when nobody seemed to become an admin no matter how positive and glowing the voting record was for the request.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:47, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

:I sure didn't feel that there were enough admins. The last time I thought about the issue, I figured that 8 bureaucrats and 120 admins would be about right. (roughly; it's been a few months since I made the estimate) [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 23:59, 13 August 2005 (UTC)

:I think we should follow the wikipedia lead and list active, semi-active, and inactive admins. Thus, instead of revoking the privileges it'll be much more clear to users that only the top list (or top two lists) should be considered. That should solve the perception problem. However, I do like the idea of encouraging people to request a deadmin if they know they won't be putting any time into it in the foreseeable future. And perhaps if someone is not active for a year, we could email them and ask, under no pressure, if they are still interested. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:59, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

:: That's more what I had in mind, purely because it's simple.

== infinite IP blocks ==

Could we please stop doing this? IP addresses do not permanently map to humans. The fight agains email spam has seen the creation of infinite IP blocks too, leaving many innocent companies and individuals with difficulty in sending email. IP address usage changes for many reasons:

*new PC purchased, eliminating spam zombie software (months or a year or two)
*student assigned to a new dorm room for the next semester (months)
*cable company reassigns addresses (days or months)
*dial-up connection (hours)
*apartment lease ends and tenant moves on (months)
*nasty person loses their job with the net connection (months)
*death, perhaps from old age

Monday I get a new IP address. Who knows? Maybe I'll be blocked because somebody misbehaved years ago.

[[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 00:22, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

: Problem is, most of those IP addresses are either hacked or misconfigured open HTTP proxy servers which spammers use to vandalize pages. There are lists of these open proxies published in the internet underground. Until these dodgy proxies are fixed, we have no other means to prevent repeated, scripted vandalism attacks from these addresses. You'll notice some of them are set by a user called &quot;User:&quot; which is an automatic script that the server admins use to mass-block those addresses on '''all''' Wikimedia wikis. If you have a better suggestion on how to prevent vandalism, suggest it here. We generally don't bother blocking the casual vandal at all. If they become a real nuisance, then I suggest a warning and short block (say 24h), increasing in duration if they persist. I haven't had to do that yet. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:37, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

::I think any vandal that would qualify as &quot;a real nuisance&quot; should be blocked for much longer than a day. A week at least. Further, any spam should be blocked immediately. An IP with a familiar vandalism couldn't possibly count as &quot;a newbie experiment,&quot; as we sometimes charitably call vandalism, so even one page being edited might call for a block. We can try to psychoanalyze vandals and argue that &quot;maybe if we don't block them, they'd get less of a thrill out of doing it,&quot; but sometimes it's just a judgement call. Very little is lost with short term blocks... and I don't even think it needs to escalate to real nuisance before doing something other than just reverting. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:16, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

::BTW, I like the idea of death from old age being a cause for a vandal to stop. I can just picture the 95 year olds writing &quot;iron my shirt&quot; everywhere. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 01:16, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

::That an IP address has a hacked or misconfigured open HTTP proxy server doesn't change things. Suppose Bob has one. After a couple months, Bob's cable company assigns a new IP address. A few months later, Bob moves into his new house in the next town over and gets DSL. Meanwhile, the old IP address gets assigned to Joe. It's many months later, and Joe discovers the wiki... nah, of course you can't edit live web pages. They were just kidding, surely. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:38, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

::I don't object to the concept of blocking by IP address. (not that I love it, but I haven't a better idea) I only object to extremely long blocks. A year might be a reasonable upper limit. [[User:AlbertCahalan|AlbertCahalan]] 01:38, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

:::I think I may have to agree with Albert here.  Even a &quot;five year&quot; IP block would be close to a death penalty here, and it would be interesting to see what kind of &quot;attacks&quot; against this or any Wikimedia server have happened (even attempts) by any IP address that has been listed as a blocked IP address for more than 1 year.  I know that is a question for developers rather than anything any admin can request, but IP address blocks that have a more definite &quot;probation&quot; period would be preferable.&lt;p&gt;As far as hacked, misconfigured, or open HTTP proxy servers is concerned, there is (or should be) some lists of servers that could accomplish this task.  IMHO this is something that should be occuring not just within this particular Wikibooks project but rather something that is system-wide across all Wikimedia projects, and that an admin (or even any registered user) should be able to &quot;suggest&quot; an IP address to be &quot;checked&quot; and verified that it is an open HTTP proxy.  There are technical means to verify that issue and IP addresses of this nature can and should be blocked across all Wikimedia projects.  This in particular would help protect smaller communities (like the Finnish Wikibooks) where a single admin simply can't keep up with everything that is happening.  As far as trying to slow down or stop vandals with a known IP address, a policy of ever increasing peanalties ought to be adopted instead, with harshness to repeat abusers.  Even this perhaps should be applied to a range of IP addresses, as dynamic IP address assignment is fairly routine even in a corporate setting where static IP addresses perhaps could be managed but for a lazy IT techie. --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 09:24, 14 August 2005 (UTC)

I'm wondering if there is a user's manual somewhere for new admins? for instance, how specifically can pages be protected/deleted, how can they be unprotected/undeleted? how do we go about blocking an IP address? how do we specify an infinate block (which is bad), from a timed block (which is not so bad)?

== Official Admin Policy ==

I am working on a draft of an official policy concerning admins, bcrats, and checkusers. I personally feel that wikibooks needs such a policy, but i want to entertain some discussion and see what the community thinks on the matter. The draft of my new proposal is located at:
:[[Wikibooks:Administrators/Proposal]]
I dont want to start active discussion on this really until we finalize the voting policy. but I do want users to come take a look at it, and see if there are any glaring problems with this draft. I have intentionally kept parts of this draft vague and open to interpretation, because I dont want to put too many rigid restrictions and guidelines on admins. I do make special note that admins can be removed if they are inactive, or if they violate policy. Alot of the points here were lifted from [[Help:Administrators]], but it is my opinion that we need an official policy on this matter, and not just a limp help file. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:05, 15 August 2006 (UTC)</text>

== Perfection not required; or, the joy of editing ==

It is a wonderful thing when someone adds a complete, well-written, final draft to Wikibooks. This should always be encouraged.

However, one of the great advantages of the [[w:wiki|wiki]] system is that incomplete, poorly-written first drafts of textbooks can evolve into polished, presentable masterpieces through the process of collaborative editing. This gives our approach an advantage over other ways of producing similar end-products. Hence, the submission of rough drafts (but not too rough) should also be encouraged.

One person can start off with an overview or a few random facts. Another person can add a minority opinion. Someone else can round off the content with additional perspectives. Yet another can play up an angle that has been neglected, or reword the earlier opinions to a more [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]]. A following person might have facts and figures or a graphic to include.

As all this material is added, anyone can jump in and refactor to turn it into a more cohesive whole. Then more text will be added, then more refactoring, and the module will gradually evolve ever-closer to the ultimate final draft.

During this process, the module might look like a first draft—or worse, a random collection of notes and factoids. Rather than being horrified by this ugliness, we should rejoice in its potential, and have faith that the editing process will turn it into brilliant prose.

Of course, we don't have to like it; we even, occasionally, criticize really substandard work, in addition to simply correcting it. The most important thing, though, is to correct it if it can be corrected. For text that is beyond hope, we have gotten into the habit of removing the offending content to the corresponding [[WB:TALK|talk page]], or, in cases where the content obviously has no redeeming merit whatsoever, deleting it outright. The latter action should not be done lightly, however.

== On editing styles ==
Generally, different people here have different editing &quot;styles&quot;. Some people edit lightly, and focus on contributing new content. Others prefer to greatly expand existing &quot;stubs&quot; and improve content. Some like to make relatively small copy-editing, linking, and page-naming changes. There's room for all of these on Wikibooks.

There are also different editing styles in the sense of how bold people are willing to be. Generally, most of us think we should [[Wikibooks:Be bold|be bold in updating pages]]. Virtually no one behaves as though previous authors need to be consulted before making changes; if we thought that, we'd make rather little progress. Quite to the contrary, some of us think you should not beat around the bush at all—simply change a page immediately, when you see something problematic, rather than to discuss changes that need to be made. Discussion, from this point of view, is a last resort. Then there is a more intermediate view, according to which dialogue ''qua'' dialogue should be respected, but at the same time a minor tweak early on can avoid a flame war. In this view, to edit radically or not will often depend on the context—which seems reasonable enough.

Again, there is a place for all of these attitudes on Wikibooks.

With large deletions or replacements, it might be better to suggest changes in a discussion, lest the original author get discouraged and quit posting.
One person's improvement is another's desecration, and nobody likes to see their work just flushed without warning.

So, whatever you do, try to preserve information. Reasons for removing bits of a module include:

*factual errors
*duplication
*irrelevancy
*patent nonsense
*[[Wikibooks:Copyrights|copyright violations]]

Alternatives include:

*rephrasing while keeping the content
*moving text within a page or to another page (existing or new)
*adding more of what you think is important to make a page more balanced

If, in your considered judgment, a page simply needs to be rewritten or changed substantially, go ahead and do that. But preserve any old contents you think might have some discussion value on the talk page, along with a comment about ''why'' you made the change. Even if you delete something that's just plain wrong, odds are that it got there because someone believed it was true, so preserve a comment that it is in fact wrong to inform later editors.

In any event, whether you decide to edit very boldly or to make inquiries on talk page first, please bear in mind that Wikibooks is not a discussion forum. Wikibooks can be a very energetic place, and it's best for the project as a whole if we concentrate our energies on improving modules rather than defending our pet theories, ideologies, religions, etc. Some consideration of [[Wikibooks:Etiquette|Etiquette]] wouldn't hurt.

==Further suggestions for the etiquette and method of editing==

* Perhaps use the discussion page to first preserve content that could be added back in error and explain why the content is being altered. Use your browser's back button to copy-paste the content to be quoted, or to reduce mistakes use two browser windows or tabs.
*: Since discussion pages can get lengthy and all content is preserved in the history, one paragraph on what is wrong and why is probably all that is needed most of the time. The exception might be when someone drastically refactors a page, in which case use a subpage of the discussion page and link to it from the discussion page.
* Use the top of discussion pages to help organize and plan collaboration efforts. For example use an outline of what still needs to be done (a to-do list for example) and who is currently working on what parts of the model. Also include links to other related discussion pages, categories or any important notices at the top so people don't accidentally delete them by mistake. 
*: As the top of discussions pages or any discussion section gets long, archive old business and discussions. ''This helps keep discussion pages current, relevant and understandable'', which is most important for keeping discussion pages usable and readable. Use archive names with the same name as a section name whenever possible so people can find discussions later on.
* Summarize long discussions and retain conclusions of long discussions, so that others can get involved later or get up to speed quickly. While this isn't required per se, doing so goes a long way towards keeping collaboration with others pleasant and discussions fresh so everyone can keep up with developments.
*Last, but not least, some numbering scheme ought to prefix all sections below the fixed sections (i.e. all are categorized as 'temporary topics' even though most of each are eventually separated and archived.) The section ordinal number prefix serves notice when something no longer appears in the ordinal list of sections as it contains only expired discussions, and pertinent information is retained.

re:So, whatever you do, try to preserve information. Reasons for removing bits of an module include:
*List is missing the obvious: ''Factual error'' or ''error in context'', A is 'wrong', and ''C goes with B, but B doesn't apply in the context so neither does C. (''One hopes these sophmoric gaffs happen less here than at Wikipedia! &lt;G&gt;) [[User:Fabartus|FrankB]]-&amp;#91;&amp;#91;User talk:Fabartus]] 06:17, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

== snippet-02 ==

''If, in your considered judgment, a page simply needs to be rewritten or changed substantially, go ahead and do that. But preserve any old contents you think might have some discussion value on the talk page, along with a comment about why you made the change. Even if you delete something that's just plain wrong, odds are that it got there because someone believed it was true, so preserve a comment that it is in fact wrong to inform later editors.''
*I'd suggest exporting only the parts most likely to be duplicated as an error to the talk, with comments, before altering content. It's easy to do from within the edit window by backspacing, cutting, moving to the talk, pasting with comment. Even easier with two browser windows open, or two tabs. One useful 'safeguard' is to edit in one type browser and browse, check, monitor, extract, compare in the other. For the latter use, one of the Tabbed browsers is best. Firefox and Netscape both fail to search into the edit window, whereas IE6 does, so that is the better browser for copyedits, spelling and minor grammer corrections.
:*Since the talks can get lengthy with too much, and all content is preserved in history pages, so a paragraph on what is wrong, and a paragraph why is probably the only need 98% of the time. The histories solve the odd 2% where large recoveries are in order. The exception might be when someone attempts a drastic refactoring, but cutting that into a 'temp page' (Sandbox) rather than the talk, with a link to it in the talk (one of those 'organized common resources' mentioned in the below&amp;mdash; information is a resource!) page.
*Using the top of talk pages as a Organized Project page is a good idea. By that I mean place project resources, including ToDo lists, lists of who is taking on what sub-part, perhaps an outline, etc. RobinH asked me for comments herein, but I don't know enough specifics of how you all work together to get specific myself. But taking the Heading with a Roster, ToDo's, and some resources as an example, the top section would be a general precise on the aims of that module, followed by the roster which should probably include when someone generally works, Third I'd place resources such as links to other modules, categories (if you use them here) and links to outside references, etc. each to their own sub-section. Fourth, the ToDo list, which people would strike out as items get finished with signature (I like to use #, and ## items in such&amp;mdash; helps in planning and organization, as the numbers can be referred to in talk sections following obviating confusion (of terms or task). 
:*As this list or any talk section gets long, it can be archived to 'clean' the page into the archive page which matches title sections, thus archiving old business and old discussions et. al by archiving just part of a section or many sections is quite easy to do. ''Such tidiness also helps in keeping the obfusticating clutter away from ongoing business'', it's most important feature. 
*Do retain a conclusion of a long discussion linking to the archived long parts, so others can get involved later or get back up to speed after a time away, as may pertain.
:*While this 'exercise in verbosity' is not 'On Policy' per se, it goes a long way to keeping collaboration with others ameniable and pleasant, so it might be considered as a 'potential guideline' as to how to keep talks fresh enough for everyone to keep up with developments. ''In this model, the old goes, and the fresh and useful stays that way without fighting clutter''.
*Last, but not least, some numbering scheme ought to prefix all sections below the fixed sections (i.e. all are categorized as 'temporary topics' even though most of each are eventually separated and archived.) The section ordinal number prefix serves notice when something no longer appears in the ordinal list of sections as it contains only expired discussions, and  pertinent information is retained.

== Proposal for major policy overhaul ==

Original e-mail from [[User:KelvSYC]] at: http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2005-July/002415.html

Reply from [[User:Robert Horning]] at: http://mail.wikipedia.org/pipermail/textbook-l/2005-July/002416.html

My original plan was to try to get all 'policy' pages such as [[WB:WIN]], etc., onto Meta, but I don't think it's going to be practical. The alternative is that each Wikimedia project remains autonomous, and has its own policy pages. It just seems a shame that many (at least en.wikipedia.org and en.wikibooks.org) shared common policies (such as [[w:WP:NPOV]] and [[WB:NPOV]]) which become desychronized over time. One of the keys rules for a DBA (database administrator) is that each datum should have one, and only one, canonical location, otherwise you end up with contradictary data. But how did things end up so confusing?

; A brief history of Wikimedia

First of all, I haven't been around that long, so some of this is guesswork.

It all started with the project now hosted at en.wikipedia.org. The idea being to collaboratively create a generalized encyclopedia with no (apparent) limitation on its scope. That is to say, entries in any natural language were considered 'fair game', and some users felt it was appropriate to create extensive entries such as 'How to play chess', and the like. The scope also allowed entries pertaining to concepts which were very specific to Wikipedia, its users, and their culture.

At some point, someone (perhaps Jimbo?) decided this was going to get in the way of creating an encyclopedia, so a number of other Wikimedia projects were set up, in the hopes that this data could be transferred to a more appropriate location.

The Wikipedia project was split up into different language codes. This was probably a good idea. It would be impossible to administer a site containing text in a dozen languages you don't understand. I realize that some people speak multiple languages, but I doubt anyone speaks all of the languages for which a Wikipedia current exists.

Meta-Wiki was put in place to take on all the Wikipedia-specific concepts, including policy, but it was only used for a short while, after which it all moved back to Wikipedia. The only roles it now serves are as a host to pages about the myriad 'associations of &lt;something&gt; Wikipedians', and as a place to post news about, and arrange translations between, projects. It also ended up as a dumping ground for content that users were told was 'inappropriate for Wikipedia'.

Wikibooks was created for the much larger articles which had enough text to constitute a whole book on the subject, but has also ended up as a dumping ground for encyclopedia-length articles.

Wiktionary was created for the shorter, dictionary-length entries, which were felt to be inappropriate for Wikipedia. This project has actually worked quite nicely, although it will always have minor scope overlap with Wikipedia, since the first sentence of a Wikipedia article is generally a dictionary-length definition, and where multiple meanings exist for the same word, they generally exist as both a Wiktionary entry, and a Wikipedia disambiguation page.

Over time, some content was transferred, while some was not. Since each project had its own 'what &lt;project&gt; is/isn't' page, users changed its scope over time as well. The endless cycle continues today:

# Create a new wiki
# Create a badly-defined scope
# Fill it with inappropriate content
# When it becomes unmanagable, goto 1

What the projects need is centralized management, but with the flexibilty and freedom to post what you like, where you like, combined with the fact that there's a negligable amount of responsibility as to who should be sorting it out, I don't think it's ever going to work.

; But what is a wiki anyway?

I guess at its most basic, it's a mapping of key/value pairs. The key is the name of a page, and the value is the text on that page. For some wikis it's pretty obvious how this mapping should work. The page named 'Programming' on Wiktionary and Wikipedia are fairly obvious, but what about Wikibooks? Should it be a book on programming? Or should that data fall into a subpage of a book on computers? e.g. 'Computers/Programming'. The point is that the MediaWiki software is a poor choice for a project intending to create books.

; Back on topic

First of all, using a 'What &lt;project&gt; is not' page as a means to determine scope is a rather strange idea. See the paragraph starting with 'The asymmetry of not' at http://abelard.org/category/category.htm#zero_error for an explanation. Personally, I think something along the lines of [[User:Aya/Wikibooks/A critique of Wikibooks#The goal of Wikibooks]] might be better, which is really just an elaboration of the fundamental policy that 'Wikibooks is a collection of open-content textbooks'. That's all you really need. I don't know where you got the phrase 'instructional material' from, but looking in a dictionary, the word 'instructional' would not preclude biographical material. Creating more pages such as [[WB:IM]] and [[WB:RM]] in addition to [[WB:WIN]] may just make things worse, as there is always the possibility that a user will find one of these pages, and not the other.

My own view is to throw away the page [[WB:WIN]], and use the page [[Wikibooks:About]] to define the scope in a more positive fashion. The exclusions listed in [[WB:WIN]] could still be a part of this page. The advantage of the page [[Wikibooks:About]] is that it's highly visible (just click on the word 'Wikibooks' on the [[Main page]] to get there). Most new users will probably just read that, not bother reading anything else, and just get on with their editing. Meta uses the page [[m:Meta:About]] for this purpose.

[[WB:HNS]] should be merged into [[WB:NC]], and the colon separator should perhaps be dropped completely, since many users are too lazy to provide backlinks to their book's main pain. As for [[WB:MOS]], that doesn't even exist. I don't recommend creating it, since it will be a fork of [[w:WP:MOS]]. Remember forks are evil. My own view is that any parts of Wikipedia's version which are relevant to all Wikimedia projects (most of it in fact) should be moved to Meta, and a new section added which pertains only to Wikibooks.

I noticed a lot of people are creating their own standards (MOSs) for individual book projects, and including the standards in subpages of the books. This is perhaps a better idea than having one big MOS containing everything.

I could go on for ages, but I'll stop here for now, to put a bit more thought into the problems. I still believe that the 'all policy should be on Meta' is right (just read [[m:Meta:About]]). I think what I need to do to fix it, is to get admin privs on meta, and tidy up the whole damn thing. I've made a start ([[m:Directory]] and [[m:Policy]]), but I'll need to make changes to [[m:Main page]] to make it much clearer as to what the hell it's all about. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:36, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

:I agree that it is time for some more organization and policy review. &quot;What Wikibooks is not&quot; also seems kind of strange to me and I like the idea of simply stating it in positive terms in the &quot;about&quot; page. I was thinking about an organizational division between 
:* textbooks, 
:* study guides,
:* non-textbook books and how-to's, including non-serious material,
:* lesson plans and other didactic materials.

:I might mention that it always seemed to make more sense to me to house everything on the same website, the encyclopedia, dictionary and textbook materials at least. Maybe someday it will all move to Wikipedia and we can just click a tab to switch between the different sister projects. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]] 22:07, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

::We certainly need a more clear cut definition of what Wikibooks is, and hence what it is not. The current definition has been causing problems on VfD. But, that's part of a wider problem with VfD, whereby some people vote to keep or delete a book depending only on how much they like it. Our most important polices (permitted content, naming conventions, rules of conduct, etc.) should be more visible, and presented in a concise form for newcomers. Neglecting to complete edit summaries seems to be the rule, maybe we need to apply some pressure to change that.

:::Personally, empty edit summaries don't bother me for the most part, since I don't necessarily trust that they match the actual edit. That is to say, I will always check the diff. The only time they're important is when the edit is contentious, especially when removing content from a page. I will almost always revert an unexplained deletion. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:15, 27 July 2005 (UTC)

== Categorization of policies ==

All those pages about policies should be categorized, and those categories should be subcategories of another category like [[:Category:Wikibooks policies and guidelines]]. Maybe we can get some ideas from Wikipedia, for example the [[w:Category:Wikipedia policies and guidelines]] is also a subcategory of [[w:Category:Wikipedia]]. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 11:32, August 9, 2005 (UTC)

: If you read [[WB:PAG]], you will notice that the following categories already exist:

:* [[:Category:Wikibooks enforced policies]]
:* [[:Category:Wikibooks proposed policies]]
:* [[:Category:Wikibooks obsolete policies]]
:* [[:Category:Wikibooks rejected policies]]

: Pages are automatically added to those categories when you include the appropriate template in the page. I have made all those a subcategory of [[:Category:Wikibooks policies]]. That should suffice for now. - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 16:52, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

== Behavioral policies ==

After seeing a [[Wikibooks:No offensive usernames|three-year old version of a Wikipedia policy]] be revived and reading the above comments, I propose that: 

Wikibooks should treat the behavioral policies listed on [[w:Wikipedia:List of policies]] as one entity, and vote on whether to enact them all and use the next versions of those policies, created on Wikipedia (provided that they aren't radically different, sort of like agreeing to license your work under the next GFDL version).

Benefits:
#All behavioral policies are written in the same spirit, and with the same goal in mind
#Wikipedia's policies have had  several years of field-testing and corrections
#Behavioral policies are general, all-purpose rules that are not unqiue to any wiki

: This is a very good idea, I agree with you. We should not waste time trying to invent something that is ready on Wikipedia. I don't think wikietiquette should be different on Wikibooks and Wikipedia. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 12:03, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

::Eleven new, somewhat verbose policies taken from a sister wiki that is not noted for its friendliness? I really hope not. What about one single concise behaviour policy (if we really need to have something formal). After all, what do we really need to say? My thoughts are:

:::Rule 1: Be nice.
:::Rule 2: If you break rule 1 then other wikibookians will take appropriate action to encourage you to be nice.
:::Rule 3: If you really do refuse to be nice, you will end up being blocked (though may be unblocked later if you offer credible evidence that you will abide by Rule 1).

::Ok, we might need a bit more than this, but probably not too much, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 18:04, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

:::One single policy is also a good idea. Really anything is better than having a dozen various policies, with half being enforced and half only proposed. But a simple three-rule policy runs the risk of [[m:instruction creep|growing longer and longer]] to handle upcoming circumstances. Of course we may be able to keep it simple, but there's a reason Wikipedia has all those policies. Assuming Wikibooks is eventually going to become as large as Wikipedia, we need to be prepared for the future. And a reasonable set of time-tested policies already happens to exist. --[[Special:Emailuser/Hagindaz|✉]][[User:Hagindaz|haginძaz]]&lt;sub&gt;[[User talk:Hagindaz|t]]&lt;/sub&gt;\&lt;sup&gt;[[Special:Contributions/Hagindaz|c]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:55, 30 April 2006 (UTC)

''there's a reason Wikipedia has all those policies.'' Yes, but what is that reason? People like me suspect that reason is apathy: old policies tend accumulate like barnacles long after they become irrelevant, and there is no pressure to get rid of them. --[[User:70.189.77.59|70.189.77.59]] 14:56, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

== Reorganising this page ==

I'd like to reorganise this page quite dramatically and, therefore, have deceided not to be too bold and consult with the community beforehand.

I think the page would be more sensible for the user if the page grouped policies and guidelines according to their status, rather than treating them one after the other (in its present form, we might as well split the page in two).

I'm thinking:
# Definition of terms.
# Procedures
## Formulating policies and guidelines
## Enforcing policies
# Enforced policies.
# Accepted guidelines.
# Proposals
# Obsolete
# Rejected

* I'd like to polish the Definition of terms section to include the should/must definitions.
* I think Proposals should perhaps transclude [[:Category:Wikibooks proposed policies]] and [[:Category:Wikibooks proposed guidelines]] rather than duplicate the content, possibly (probably?) causing inconsistencies.
--[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:21, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

:Sounds good to me, this page always has been a bit of an eyesore, in my opinion. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 12:37, 18 September 2006 (UTC)

=== Definition of terms ===

I've cleaned this up for clarity. I commented the &quot;Wikibooks * ...&quot; parts out since I don't really think they are necessary. Their meaning is simply so obvious. As for the must/should, these have a subtle difference which is good to clarify. I'd still like to slim that section down a bit.

I'm still not sure how to word the official/obsolete/rejected/proposed definitions. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 00:01, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

I've also acted on my slimming down on the must/should definitions as threatened earlier. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 08:19, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

=== Change to categorization ===

Currently, we have several categories which I'd like to see changed/merged. See table:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Category !! Template !! New category !! New template
|-
| [[:Category:Wikibooks enforced policies]] || {{tl|enforced}}
| [[:Category:Wikibooks policies]] || {{tl|policy}}
|-
| [[:Category:Wikibooks guidelines]] || {{tl|guideline}} || colspan=&quot;2&quot; | same both
|-
| [[:Category:Wikibooks obsolete policies]] || {{tl1|obsolete|&lt;new one&gt;}} || [[:Category:Wikibooks obsolete policies and guidelines]] || same
|-
| [[:Category:Wikibooks rejected policies]] || {{tl|rejected}}
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | [[:Category:Wikibooks rejected policies and guidelines]] || rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | {{tl|rejected}}
|-
| [[:Category:Wikibooks rejected guidelines]] || {{tl|rejected guideline}}
|-
| [[:Category:Wikibooks proposed policies]] || {{tl|proposed}}
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | [[:Category:Wikibooks proposed policies and guidelines]] || rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | {{tl|proposed}}
|-
| [[:Category:Wikibooks proposed guidelines]] || {{tl|proposed guideline}}
|}

The rationale for merging the proposed policy and guideline categories is that, at least recently, proposals have been switched between the two, and being able to discuss which it should be would be a useful option without much beurocracy. The category page could also be used to coordinate which PAG proposal was currently being discussed. As for the rest of them, I think seperating them into seperate categories serves little purpose (except in the current official ones).

The names begin to sound a little odd, though, so I've been wondering if there is a nice collective term for &quot;policies and guidelines&quot; (and even essays?). The best I've come up with is &quot;principles&quot;, but that might just confuse and complicate. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 08:19, 23 September 2006 (UTC)

: This is now mostly done. There is now an over-arching category, [[:Category:Wikibooks policies and guidelines]], for all PAG matters. It should contain everything.
: The only two outstanding issues are to run through everything and make sure there aren't any typos, mistakes and inconsistancies, and to make sure everything is categorized properly (pipe what needs to be piped so that it appeas at the correct place in lists etc.) --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:39, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

== Enforced and Official ==

I'm inlcined to start using &quot;official&quot; instead of &quot;enforced&quot; when referring to a policy or guideline. It seems odd that a policy should be enforced without being official and vice versa.

Essentially, there are some policies that are simply &quot;generally accepted&quot; without having been voted on (these would be enforced, but not official; though the page makes it seem that these aren't labelled as enforced). I'd say, we brand these as &quot;official&quot; as well (and, if need be, vote on them).

Using the term enforced for guidelines (as is currently done) also seems a little odd. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 00:01, 20 September 2006 (UTC)

: Done. {{tl|Policy}} and {{tl|Guideline}} now use &quot;official&quot;. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 06:53, 11 October 2006 (UTC)

== these need some explanation ==

Under style guidelines, there is listed

 # Use color sparingly
 # Use subheads sparingly

why?? I'm not going to follow arbitrary guidelines for no reason whatsoever. Subheadings provide structure. Colour can be very illuminating. Why not do what works? Other similar 'one liners' are also owed some explanation. --[[User:Pfctdayelise|pfctdayelise]] 02:58, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

:Good point. The color one, i think, just makes things more readable, especially for people who are colorblind, or who need high-contrast settins in their browser. Sometimes manually setting the colors using HTML directives can override the disability settings on the person's browser. Perhaps it's a small reason (and possibly contrived), but it's something to consider before you turn your page into a terrible rainbow. 
:As to the subheadings one, I think the point is to use &quot;deeply nested&quot; subheadings sparingly. High-level subheadings can actually be smaller then the surrounding body text, and pages with so many levels of sub-headings should probably be broken into sub-pages instead. Also, pages with dozens of headings and subheadings will have an obnoxiously long TOC on the page, which can be annoying. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 03:13, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

== Merging Policies and guidelines sections ==

I'd like to merge the policies and guidelines sections. They are topically identical and only differ in how strict they are. I suggest the following structure (sublists contain which current sections should go where):

Official policies and guidelines
* Copyrights policies
** Don't infringe on copyrights
* Project scope
** Wikibooks is an instructional resource
* Structure
** Wikibooks structure
* Content
** Wikibooks content
** Content guidelines
** Style guidelines
** General guidelines: [[Wikibooks:Editing guideline]]
* Behaviour
** Respect other contributors
** Behavior guidelines
* Maintainance
** Administrators
** General guidelines: [[Wikibooks:Decision making]]

Comments appreciated. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 23:31, 7 December 2006 (UTC)

:The word &quot;guideline&quot; usually means a weaker form of policy. So, yes, gudielines are less strict policies. The reason policies are separated from guidelines in general is to highlight the fact that the policies are strict rules. I am happy with the current division - it draws a clear line in the sand: on one side are guidance notes and on the other side there are rules. [[User:RobinH|RobinH]] 10:29, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

== Merging policies and guidelines into one category ==

Currently, our policies and guidelines are seperated only by strictness. Some are policies actually have some parts that have &quot;should&quot;s in them and some guidelines might have some &quot;must&quot;s (haven't checked the latter). Anyway, given the definitions given at the top of the page, we really don't need to distinguish between policies and guidelines; a policy can contain both requirements and recommendations.

I'd really appreciate a discussion on this as it would be quite a drastic move. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] 01:58, 8 December 2006 (UTC)

== Objections to Merging policies ==

As I have stated elsewhere, I personally prefer several smaller policies that are short and to the point as opposed to a single monolithic policy.  Here are some reason why:

Individual Policies are....

*Easier to reach a concensus.  If the topic is focused, you can usually get a number of people to agree to individual points.
*Easier to change.  If a policy contains just a few words and the justifications for the policy are weak, it is easier to change a single small policy instead of a huge monolithic policy document.
*Easier to write.  By keeping a policy to a specific point where there have been issues raised in the past, you can usually come up with come very clear wording that doesn't try to be everything for every situation.

This IMHO is where [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks/Unstable]] is falling apart as it is trying to become a single monolithic policy for a whole bunch of things at the same time.  My experience is that such policies rarely gain community concensus and often languish for years before acceptance, if ever.

My comments I made earlier with [[Wikibooks talk:Policies and guidelines/Proposed reform#Style over Substance]] still apply here.  It is possible (and it works rather well) to ammend policies one section at a time, making overall very minor modifications.  That precludes such massive overhauls such as what is being done with the What is Wikibooks, which really need to have stronger attention by the Wikibooks community for such a massive change.  Smaller changes, while significant over time, can also be reversed easily.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 16:56, 27 December 2006 (UTC)
:I fully agree that it would be far easier to get acceptance of smaller policies. Indeed all three points of Rob's seem entirely valid to me.  The sheer content of a single (or small number) all embracing policy is quite worrying never mind being all things to all people --[[User:Herbythyme|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;Herby&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;b&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#90F&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Herbythyme|talk thyme]]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 17:01, 27 December 2006 (UTC)

:I think you may have misunderstood Swift's suggestion (if thats what this is in response to). Swift was suggesting only the merging of categories and I think getting rid of the distinction between policy and guideline. Not about merging any current policy/guideline. I agree with your pointers, but disagree with your use WIW/Unstable as an example. It has a focused topic, what contents of Wikibooks consists of. Its about the same size as the current WIW. It does address problems now and in the past. It doesn't try to be everything to everyone. Before I did some major editing of it, the proposal was a lot longer and I think a lot less focused and didn't really address a specific point. It tries to be a more general policy (or guideline if you prefer) to address some confusion over what Wikibooks is for. I do admit its a major change in approach and probably the best solution which has already been suggested on its talk page is to discussion and deal with each section one at a time. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:02, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

:I'm in agreement with Rob here, and even though I appreciate your vision, Darklama, I don't think it's a method that's going to work in the long term. There are two options that I would like to consider:
:#A small number of policy documents, reasonably large, but vague. These documents would be supported by a number of smaller ancillary guideline pages, that would detail the specifics of the policy, as needed.
:#A large number of small policy documents, specific to their own topics, and not requiring external supporting documents.
:WIW is an important policy I think, but if we try to make it the only resource, or the only policy document, we are going to fail. I say we make it more simple, and use guidelines to fill in the details. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 02:35, 28 December 2006 (UTC)

== Jimbo ==

I've removed the following text from this page:

:''In extreme and unusual cases, [[en:user:Jimbo Wales|Jimbo Wales]] has stepped in to ban a user who has proven to be unusually disruptive. Jimbo has also declared certain policies to be, essentially, official [[en:Wikimedia|Wikimedia]] policies; see [http://www.wikipedia.org/pipermail/wikien-l/2002-November/000083.html this Wikien-l post].''

I did this for a few reasons:
#Jimbo has never really been as big an authority here as he has been at wikipedia (although many people, myself included, highly value Jimbo's opinions)
#Jimbo is generally less active in WMF things then he used to be.
#If anybody has the ability to dictate policy, it is likely the WMF board as a whole, not just Jimbo.
#To the best of my knowledge, Jimbo or the WMF has never dictated a policy to us that we must obey.
I'm hoping that this removal won't upset anybody. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 00:32, 1 June 2007 (UTC)

:I think the key aspect here is that Jimbo is not really active with WMF projects (although I've seen some recent posts by him on Foundation-l).  Part of this is (I think) to give Florance the chance to take the helm of the WMF as the current chair and not overshadow her.  Jimbo does maintain a seat on the board of trustees, but is concentrating most of his efforts on Wikia, in terms of making policy decisions and such.

:As far as the WMF or Jimbo &quot;dictating policy&quot;, I'll leave that subject alone.  I've spilled far too much ink on that subject.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 11:34, 1 June 2007 (UTC)

==Introduction==
This is the very first lesson in learning a second language, the Spanish Language!

This lesson begins with simple greetings, and covers important ideas of the Spanish Language. Throughout education, methods of teaching Spanish have changed greatly. Years ago, the Spanish Language was taught simply by memory. Today, however, the Spanish Language is taught by moving more slowly and covering grammar and spelling rules.

Again, this is an introduction. If this is the first time you are attempting to learn Spanish, do not become discouraged if you cannot understand, pronounce, or memorize some of the things discussed here.

In addition, learning a second language requires a basic understanding of your own language.  You may find, as you study Spanish, that you learn a lot about English as well.  At their core, all languages share some simple components like verbs, nouns, adjectives, and plurals.  English, as your first language, comes naturally to you and you don't think about things like subject-verb agreement, verb conjugation, or usage of the various tenses; yet, you use these concepts on a daily basis.

While English is described as a very complicated language to learn, many of the distinguishing grammar structures have been simplified over the years.  This is not true for many other languages.  Following the grammatical conventions of Spanish will be very important, and can actually change the meaning of phrases.  You'll see what is meant by this as you learn your first verbs &lt;i&gt;ser&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;estar&lt;/i&gt;.

Do not become discouraged!  You can do it.

'''Exercise:''' [[Spanish/Exercises/Greetings|Greetings]]

==Grammar: Personal Pronouns==
Spanish has six different types of pronouns.

{{Spanish Grammar|1=Los Pronombres|2=

{| border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;
|- style=&quot;background: #F0F0FF&quot;
| width=&quot;20%&quot; | '''Person'''
| width=&quot;30%&quot; | '''English equivalent'''
| width=&quot;40%&quot; | '''Spanish equivalent'''
|-
| '''1st person singular (1)''' || I || yo
|-
| '''2nd person singular (2)''' || ''singular'' you (informal)
| tú
|-
| '''3rd person singular (3)''' || he, she, you (formal)
| él, ella, usted
|-
| '''1st person plural (4)''' || we || nosotros, nosotras
|-
| '''2nd person plural (5)''' || ''plural'' you (informal)
| vosotros, vosotras
|-
| '''3rd person plural (6)''' || they, you (formal)
| ellos, ellas, ustedes
|}
}}
&lt;/br&gt;

'''A few things to keep in mind:'''
* It is normal in Spanish to omit the personal pronoun (i.e. you seldom say '''yo estoy bien''', but '''estoy bien''', and you ask '''¿Cómo se llama?''' instead of '''¿Cómo se llama usted?''') because the specific conjugation of a verb usually indicates which person is the subject. However, usted, él and ella all use the same verb form so if you choose to drop the pronoun in this case it must be clear in the situational context which pronoun is being referenced.
* In most of Spain the vosotros form can be used to address a group of familiar people (e.g. friends), and ustedes is used with more formality (e.g. recent acquaintances). In all Latin American countries and parts of Spain ustedes is used also for a familiar group of people; in these countries the &quot;vosotros&quot; form is almost never used.
* In Argentina, parts of Uruguay, and some other countries, the ''tú'' form is replaced with ''vos.''
* ''Usted'' and ''ustedes'' can be abbreviated as ''Ud.'' and ''Uds.'', respectively.

==Grammar: Verbs ser and estar==

Spanish has two different words that can be translated with &quot;''to be''&quot;.
'''Ser''' is used more for more permanent characteristics (&quot;''Soy Luis''&quot;) whereas '''estar''' is used for more temporary or changeable conditions, such as location (&quot;''La papelera está al lado del escritorio''&quot;, &quot;The trash can is beside the desk&quot;) and  feeling (&quot;''Estoy bien''&quot;). A good way to remember when to use &quot;estar&quot; is by using the rhyme, &quot;To tell how you feel or where you are, always use the verb estar.&quot; In future lessons we will come back to the uses of ser and estar. 

Here we will look at the conjugations in the ''present indicative''.

!colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#CFEBBE&quot;|Notes about ''Ñ'' and ''RR''
|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#E7F5DE&quot;|
''N'' and ''Ñ'' are considered two different letters, as are ''RR'' and ''R'' (though no words begin with ''RR'').  They are alphabetized as separate letters, so ''Ñ'' always comes after ''N'', regardless of where it appears in the word.  Ex: ''muñeca'' comes after ''municipal'', and ''carro'' comes after ''carta''.
|-

|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#F3F5DE&quot;|
''CH'' and ''LL'' used to be considered as distinct letters of the alphabet, but in 1994, the Real Academia Española (Spanish Royal Academy) declared that ''CH'' and ''LL'' were not letters but [[w:Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]. Accordingly, words beginning with ''CH'' and ''LL'' are now alphabetized under ''C'' and ''L'', respectively.

|-
|colspan=&quot;29&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#F5E1DE&quot;|
''K'' and ''W'' are part of the alphabet but are mostly seen in foreign derived words and names, such as karate and whisky. For instances, kilo is commonly used in Latin America to refer to a kilogram.

Although the above will help you understand, proper pronunciation of Spanish consonants is a bit more complicated:

Most of the consonants are pronounced as they are in American English with these exceptions:
*'''b''' like the English ''b'' at the start of a word and after ''m'' or ''n''; otherwise is pronounced like a cross between a ''v'' and a ''b'' (in Spanish there's no distinction for '''b''' and '''v''')
*'''c''' before '''a''', '''o''', '''u''' and other consonants, like English ''k''
*'''c''' before '''i''' and '''e''' like English ''th'' in “think” (in Latin America is like English ''s'')
*'''ch''' like ''ch'' in “cheese”
*'''d''' between vowels (even if it starts a word following a word ending in a vowel) or at the end of a word, like English ''d'' in dental
*'''g''' before '''e''' or '''i''' like the Scottish pronunciation of ''ch'' in “loch”, except that it is voiced
*'''g''' before '''a''' or '''o''' like ''g'' in “get”
*'''h''' is always silent (except in the digraph ''ch'')
*'''j''' like the Scottish pronunciation of ''ch'' in “loch”, except that it is voiced
*'''ll''' traditionally pronounced like lli in “million”, it is now pronounced like English y in “yes”, except that it is more voiced
*'''ñ''' like ni in “onion” (or gn in French cognac)
*'''q''' like the English ''k''
*'''r''' slighty trilled; like a soft ''d'' except at the beginning of a word or after '''l''', '''n''' or '''s''' where it is trilled
*'''rr''' should be trilled longer than a single ''r''
*'''v''' like the English ''b'' at the start of a word and after ''m'' or ''n''; otherwise is pronounced like a cross between a ''v'' and a ''b'' (in Spanish there's no distinction for '''b''' and '''v''')
*'''z''' like the English ''th'' (in Latin America, like English ''s'')

==Vowel pronunciation==
The pronunciation of vowels is as follows:

*'''a''' [a] &quot;''La Mano''&quot; as in &quot;Kahn&quot;          (ah)
*'''e''' [e] &quot;''Mente''&quot; as the ''ay'' in &quot;day&quot;  (e)
*'''i''' [i] &quot;''Sin''&quot; as the ''ea'' in &quot;lean&quot;   (i)
*'''o''' [o] &quot;''Como''&quot; as in &quot;no&quot;.              (short o)
*'''u''' [u] &quot;''Lunes''&quot; as in &quot;toon&quot; or &quot;loom&quot;  (oo)
The &quot;u&quot; is always silent after &quot;q&quot; (as in &quot;qué&quot; pronounced kā). 

Spanish also uses the ¨ (diaeresis) diacritic mark over the vowel u to indicate that it is pronounced separately in places where it would normally be silent. For example, in words such as ''vergüenza'' (&quot;shame&quot;) or ''pingüino'' (&quot;penguin&quot;), the u is pronounced as in the English &quot;w&quot; and so forms a diphthong with the following vowel: [we] and [wi] respectively. It is also used to preserve sound in stem changes and in commands.

==Semi-Vowels==

*'''y''' [ʝ] &quot;''Reyes''&quot; similar to the y of &quot;yet&quot;, but more voiced (in some parts of Latin America it is pronounced as s in &quot;vision&quot; [ʒ] or sh in &quot;flash&quot; [ʃ])

At the end of a word or when it means &quot;and&quot; (&quot;''y''&quot;) it is pronounced like '''i'''.

==Acute accents==
Spanish uses the ´ (Acute) diacritic mark over vowels to indicate a vocal stress on a word that would normally be stressed on another syllable; Stress is contrastive. For example, the word ''ánimo'' is normally stressed on ''a'', meaning &quot;mood, spirit.&quot; While ''animo'' is stressed on ''ni'' meaning &quot;I cheer.&quot; And ''animó'' is stressed on ''mó'' meaning &quot;he cheered.&quot; 

Additionally the acute mark is used to disambiguate certain words which would otherwise be homographs. It's used in various question word or relative pronoun pairs such as ''cómo'' (how?)&amp; ''como'' (as), ''dónde''(where?) &amp; ''donde'' (where), and some other words such as ''tú'' (you) &amp; ''tu'' (your), ''él'' (he/him) &amp; ''el'' (the).

!I
!O
!U
|-bgcolor=&quot;#DEE7F5&quot; valign=top align=&quot;center&quot;
|á
|é
|í
|ó
|ú
|}

==Emphasis==

The rules of stress in Spanish are:

1. When the word ends in a vowel or in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;s&quot; the emphasis falls on the second to last syllable.

Eg: Mañana, Como, Dedos, Hablan.

2. When the word ends in a consonant other than &quot;n&quot; or &quot;s&quot;, the emphasis falls on the last syllable.

Eg: Ciudad, Comer, Reptil.

3. If the above two rules don't apply, there will be an accent to show the stress.

Eg: Fíjate, Inglés, Teléfono.

4. '''SPECIAL CASE''': Adverbs ending in ''-mente'', which are derived from adjectives, have two stresses. The first stress occurs in the ''adjective part'' of the adverb, on the syllable where the adjective would normally be stressed. The second stress occurs on the ''-men-'' syllable.

Eg: Solamente, Felizmente, Cortésmente.

== Which pages should we still link to? ==

I assume all the pages of the old help hierarchy that we no longer link to should be deleted in the future. (I've included &lt;tt&gt;Help:Introduction 2&lt;/tt&gt; in them in order to mark them.) Should we still link to [[Wikibooks:Welcome|Help:Introduction]]? Doesn't [[Wikibooks:Welcome]] and [[Wikibooks:Welcome|Wikibooks:About]] cover the same information and more? I would like to keep a link to [[Help:Contributing|Help:Contributing to Wikibooks]] for a while because this was my primary source of information about editing (or at least of links to the corresponding pages). --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 19:49, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

Should we include a link to [[Wikibooks:Templates]]? I think it is about the only useful directory of templates. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 15:54, 23 December 2008 (UTC)

==PDF Books==
I have spent the last 4-6 months working on the Commons Category:Pdf files and have created several subcategories. Many of the saves and deletions are books, University theses, manuals etc in Pdf format. It was suggested on a discussion page at one time that Pdf books and Theses go in wikibooks. If so how do I go about linking or moving these book files to here? [[User:WayneRay|WayneRay]] ([[User talk:WayneRay|talk]]) 15:50, 30 December 2008 (UTC)WayneRay

:You might want to discuss this question at [[WB:RR]]. I think University theses don't belong in Wikibooks because (at least in the Universities I know) they usually include original research, which should not be published at Wikibooks ([[WB:NOR]]). Moreover, you would have to convert the PDF files to the wiki markup language, as the hosting of existing books (in the PDF format) is discouraged ([[WB:SOURCE]] and [[WB:HOST]]). --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 16:41, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

:Last I heard in a recent reform of Commons' inclusion policy, PDF files are still allowed on Commons. I don't see any reason why they would need to be moved anywhere. They can be accessed from any project where they might be appropriate. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:14, 11 January 2009 (UTC)

== Help cleanup ==

Some clean up effort has been going on for some time now, on and off again, to make Wikibooks' help more useful. I propose that Wikibooks' help space be treated like a book. By formatting pages like is done within our books, people unfamiliar with Wikibooks' style can quickly become familiar with how things are done differently on Wikibooks. Using this approach the help space can teach and help people understand how to do things on Wikibooks by following its own example. To this end, I think some requirements are a must: each page must include a 2 level heading with the page/chapter title; additional headings must use 3 level heading or greater; text must not come before the first level 2 heading; and the help space must have a consistent style, which means discussion needs to happen to develop a style guide for the help namespace.

I also think the help space could be made more useful by including more media, diagrams, illustrations, etc. However media should be used to compliment rather than substitute for missing information, in order to make Wikibooks' help accessible to more people, such as the blind.

Any thoughts, ideas, opinions, or any other suggestions? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:41, 11 January 2009 (UTC)

: I don't have any objections as such to treating the Help name-space as a book, but would caution against forcing it into that mold. First of all, I don't foresee anyone really reading this cover to cover. It should, therefore, be treated more as a handbook with a strong emphasis on structure to help readers quickly locate useful information.
: Linear navigation aids will not necessarily be of much use for such a book. As for other Wikibooks conventions, I would think it more useful to point to various featured books for examples as there often exist multiple approaches to similar issues.
: Whiteknight wants to take the book-approach a step further and deprecate the Help name-space all together. I'm not sure which approach is the best. I've so far just been trying to wrap my head around the sprawling set of pages that we have here. For the time begin, I think it would be best to implement changes in increments, first organising the available contents and then molding it into whatever we deem best. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:49, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
:: Your saying what I really meant anyways. I was trying to suggest a strong emphases on structure, as well as a strong emphases on consistent style. I wasn't suggesting that there necessarily be a specific reading order or navigation aids. I guess I'm a bit ahead of you in that regard, I've already wrapped my head around the help pages, years ago. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:01, 12 January 2009 (UTC)
::: Great! It sounds like we have a similar enough a vision. Let's get to work! --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:48, 13 January 2009 (UTC)

:So, how will the redesigned help space be different from [[Using Wikibooks]]? One of the major differences between the current help pages and [[Using Wikibooks]] is probably that help pages are full of links (and should be in my opinion) while the pages in [[Using Wikibooks]] have less links (since they should be self-contained as in a good textbook). Do you intend to keep this difference? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 12:40, 13 January 2009 (UTC)

::Well I guess to me the most obvious differences will be in presentation and audience. I think Using Wikibooks is intended to be read in a certain order and is intended to be read by an audience already familiar with most wiki concepts, while the help space is likely to depend less on a specific reading order and should be intended to be read by people not familiar with most wiki concepts. I would like to make the help space more self-contained and limit links to important things explained in greater detail that don't quite fit the beginner audience, by linking only to Using Wikibooks and to the [[mw:|MediaWiki website]] if I can. I think links should be used more sparingly than they currently are. Does that answer your questions?

::: It does, thanks. I wasn't aware that Using Wikibooks is intended for an audience who is already familiar with most wiki concepts. Since I'm rather new I often read help pages and in fact I'm often missing links. In particular, I often know that I have read some information but don't find the page to read it again. The most recent case was [[Help:Category]] which didn't link to the Wikibooks-specific information at [[Wikibooks:Categories]] (I added that link); thus, I was searching quite a bit for that page. Thus, at least currently I think links to the Wikibooks namespace should also be included. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 14:22, 13 January 2009 (UTC)

:::: I could be wrong about the intended audience or what assumptions Using Wikibooks makes. Even if there is some overlap, I don't think that is going to be a problem. I think linking to related Wikibooks policies like with your example is fine. Don't get me wrong, I'm not suggesting that links be blindly deleted. I just think the help space relies too much on external links in an attempt to make up for what is missing or what is lacking, rather than expanding the available help. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 20:00, 13 January 2009 (UTC)

== Deleting non-Wikibooks-specific pages ==

I've mentioned this to Darklama, but I figured I'd add this here in case others would like to comment.

We have a number of help pages that explain how to use markup. The problem is that they are unmaintained versions of content that rather belongs at Meta and the MediaWiki wiki. I've gone through these and have found nothing of use to describe Wikibooks related syntax. I propose that the following be deleted:

*{{bad link|Help:EasyTimeline syntax}} (See [[mw:Extension:EasyTimeline/syntax]])
*{{bad link|Help:HTML in wikitext}} (See [[meta:Help:HTML in wikitext]])
*{{bad link|Help:List}} (See [[meta:Help:List]])
*{{bad link|Help:Variable}}, {{bad link|Help:Magic words}} (See: [[mw:Help:Magic words]])
*{{bad link|Help:Navigational image}} (See [[meta:Help:Navigational image]])
*{{bad link|Help:Special characters}}, {{bad link|Help:Special characters/Part 2}}, [[Help:Turkish characters}} (See: [[meta:Help:Special characters]]).
*{{bad link|Help:TeX markup}}, {{bad link|Help:Formula}} (See [[meta:Help:Displaying a formula]]
*{{bad link|Help:URL}} redirect to [[Help:Editing]]?

The parenthesised links indicate where I believe we should point users who might be looking for this sort of content. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 22:11, 4 February 2009 (UTC)

Oh, and this one too:
* [[Help:ISBN links]] (See [[mw:Manual:ISBN]])
--[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:29, 5 February 2009 (UTC)

: I don't think these pages are needed because the majority of the markup is described already in [[Help:Editing]] or should be described there. I think [[Help:Templates]] should also discuss variables and magic words. I don't think there will really be a need to point users to content on the other projects.

: Also I think a lot of the help on Meta is in the process of being moved to MediaWiki, because its not specific to Wikimedia projects. I think there also has been some talk of using Wikibooks to aid in improving the mediawiki documentation. In either case the lack of stability is one more reason not to rely on Meta or MediaWiki much. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 05:58, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

:: As far as I know, the transfer from Meta to MediaWiki to the help namespace was abandoned after the MediaWiki Help namespace was put in the public domain (the manual and extension namespace are still transwikied). The MediaWiki Help namespace has since been built from scratch. It is steadily improving and I recommend that we help direct our non-Wikibooks specific documentation efforts there. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:22, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

::: I think it may still be happening. I have tried to improve some help on Meta for instance only to go back to it to find that the page had moved to MediaWiki. I have also occasionally went to a help page to double check something only to find that that its been marked to be moved to MediaWiki or a notice that updates should now be done at MediaWiki. I think Wikibooks needs to maintain some local documentation, because linking to Meta and MediaWiki doesn't seem to be enough for most users. I just think that these pages are unneeded because local documentation is either already present on another page or should be. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 09:08, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

: [[Image:Yes_check.svg|15px| ]] '''Done''' Whew! I've updated a bunch of links, but left most of those on pages in the help namespace as we'll have to go through those anyway. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 10:17, 13 February 2009 (UTC)

== Page headings ==
: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller&quot;&gt;''The following discussion was moved here from [[Help talk:Tracking changes#Page title]] after it moved on to a more general discussion about the sectioning of content in the help namespace. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:06, 11 February 2009 (UTC)''&lt;/span&gt;
I've just [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Help:Revision_review&amp;diff=1395613&amp;oldid=1395393 reverted] part of an earlier edit. I removed a section header titled &quot;Stable revisions&quot; that spanned the entire page, and bumped the sub-section headers. If a section really spans the entire page, then the page should probably be renamed to its title.

I wasn't sure what the most proper page name would be so I checked [[mw:Help:FlaggedRevs]] which states that stable revisions are only revisions of a certain limit. On Wikibooks that limit is currently at the lowest (sighting). It might be more useful to keep a more general title for this page in line with the help page currently being developed over at MediaWiki.org. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 07:57, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

: Don't think of it as a section heading, but as a page heading. Books do that all the time, its considered part of Wikibooks' style. This goes back to my suggestion on [[Help talk:Contents]] to make the help pages follow some basic book style guidelines. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:47, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

:: Oh. But we already have page headings: the page titles. I'd agree that designating the help pages with a certain look could be useful. Instead of a &quot;page heading&quot; we could adda navigation bar with a nice, helpful looking icon. The {{tl|useful}} template helps with creating a standard look, but, ironically, isn't very useful itself. I'd be rather opposed to adding these page headings. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 17:09, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

::: I disagree. A page's title isn't a heading. The page title doesn't even show up in the TOC that is generated. Why would you be rather opposed to using page headings? I've been trying to add them to every help page I've edited for awhile now. I don't think a page's title is very useful on paper. I'd like the help pages to eventually be printed as a way of attracting more contributors to Wikibooks. Also I thought we had already agreed on [[Help talk:Contents]] that navigational templates shouldn't be used? I guess you could say I'd be rather opposed to not using page headings. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 04:57, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

:::: The page title is a h1-heading. That isn't just technical hair-splitting as that's how it's rendered both on screen and in print. I remember reading in some W3C document on HTML recommending that pages have only a single h1 level heading each, but be sectioned up with h2 and higher. A single section for the entire page just seems redundant.
:::: I consider it a feature that this doesn't show up in the generated TOC. The &quot;Stable Revisions&quot; heading in [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Help:Revision_review&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=1395613 this version] serves little purpose on that page and forces every other section to be pushed down one level. I, furthermore, prefer having the h2 level headings to section pages up into logical parts as they render by default with that line underneith and the higher level headings as rather small and similar.
:::: If you'd like this type of page-wide sections to make it easier to stich them together in a print version, how about adding h1 level headings on the print version page (which I'd consider the the most logical approach) or create a collection?
:::: I think I misunderstood you a bit in the [[Help talk:Contents#Help cleanup|Help cleanup]] discussion. I think we shouldn't necessarily conform to a ''linear'' navigation, but consider a template with an overview of useful pages, well ... useful. It might be useful to move these two topics to [[Help talk:Contents]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:34, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

::::: First off I was using a h2 heading, not a h1 heading, so there was only a single h1 level heading on the page. I think h1 headings should correlate to the sections of the help (like Introduction, Browsing Wikibooks, etc) and h2 headings should be used to divide the help into &quot;chapters&quot;. I think this is what books do, although the separation tends to depend on whether a book merely has chapters or needs to be divided further than that. From there h3 level headings and higher are used to further divide content. This still is in line with W3C's recommendation, so I don't see the problem.
::::: As I'm sure you know, modules are often chapters or parts of a chapter. I think if a module is a chapter it should only have one h2 heading, or if a module is part of a chapter it should only have one h3 heading. I think doing this does serve a purpose beyond ''pushing page sections down''. I think how the help is divided should be reflected in the use of different heading levels, and should reflect more than just how a module is divided, so that readers and writers understand how a book is divided. Plus I don't think there should be any text above a page's generated TOC. I think having text above a page's generated TOC interferes with or interrupts the flow of reading the page.
::::: Some printed books don't require that they be read from front to back in a liner order. I think this could be considered that type of book, so that's why I don't see a problem with not using navigational aids. Feel free to move this discussion there. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 08:51, 6 February 2009 (UTC)

:::::: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:smaller&quot;&gt;I've just moved the discussion here: [[Help talk:Contents]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:06, 11 February 2009 (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;

:::::: I know you used a h2 heading. I thought that was clear from the first paragraph of my previous comment: &quot;''[Pages should be] sectioned up with h2 and higher. A single section for the entire page just seems redundant.''&quot; I do realise that you had a useful purpose in mind with your edits. I never said that &quot;''pushing page sections down''&quot; was the purpose, but noted it as the effect.
:::::: I think we may have been mis-reading each others comments a bit lately on issues where we don't see eye to eye. Do you see how I think you've misinterpreted my previous comment? Do you find that I'm misunderstanding you as well? I'd appreciate it if we could sort that out as I feel like we're talking in two different dialects and not progressing much because of it. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:30, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

(reset)

I still don't understand what you're trying to say or why you disagree with my approach. Whatever you were trying to explain wasn't clear to me from the context. I guess I don't understand your reference to h1 and W3C's recommendations. To me what you said suggested that you think I wasn't following W3C's recommendation because I was using h1 headings, which wasn't apparently what you meant.

I only see that I must have misunderstood your previous comment, but not how I misunderstood it because you haven't provided any further explanation. I can't tell yet if you've misunderstood me as well. What have I said that you think you've misunderstood? If I understand you right, you seem to think the purpose of section headings is to separate a module into sections. I on the other hand think section heads are for separating a book into sections and subsections. I guess you see each help page as standing on it own, and I see the each help page as being part of a book where each chapter can be read independently. Other than trying to explain in our own words what we each think the other person is saying and trying to clarify what is misunderstood, I'm not sure what else we can do to reduce any misunderstandings, without knowing what is misunderstood. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:24, 11 February 2009 (UTC)

: Sorry for the late reply. What I disagree with is your use of a single section to encompass the entire page. I was concerned that you ''might'' think my approach didn't tie the sections of the page together tightly enough. Rather than ''just'' saying that I disagreed with the use of only a single h2 heading per page, I therefore lead into it with the reference to the W3C's recommendation. My aim was to clarify that I didn't think the sections should just dangle unconnected, and that the h1 section (the title) should &amp;mdash; and already does &amp;mdash; do this.
: I don't, actually, think that I'm misunderstanding you a lot, but figured I'd still ask.
: I think we have fairly similar ideas of what to do with these pages, but differ mostly on formatting (well, and that I want to &quot;outsource&quot; simple syntax stuff to [[mw:]]; but that's a different topic). I don't think the help pages shouldn't form a whole, but feel (like you) that it's important that they be able to stand on their own. I'm less interested in printing these out, than in having them accessible and organised for users. Would you be willing to accept the compromise to place h1 headings between page inclusions on print versions? I don't think we should be formatting individual pages in for how they should come out on print and should focus on how they display to online users of Wikibookians. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 06:58, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

== Weeding ==

I'd like to get the community input before weeding out a few practically unused pages in the help namespace:

*{{bad link|Help:Introduction 3}}
*{{bad link|Help:Donate your book to humanity}}
*{{bad link|Help:Editing sections of included templates}}
*{{bad link|Help:How to create tables}}
*{{bad link|Help:How to delete pages}}
*{{bad link|Help:How to draw a diagram with Dia}}
*{{bad link|Help:TeX requests}}
*{{bad link|Help:Types of content}}
*: None of these is linked from anywhere useful. I suggest we delete them all. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:18, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

*{{bad link|Help:Textbook Figures and Diagrams}}
*: The only meaningful link to this page is from a {{tlx|historical project page}}) --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:18, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

*{{bad link|Help:Open content}}
*: A borderline case in my book. The only link to it is through a redirect at {{bad link|Open content}} and may not have been intnetional. {{bad link|Help:Donate images to this book}} is in need of an overhaul anyway and I just don't see this to be very useful. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:18, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

Agree on deletion of them all.  I had never seen them before you pointed them out, so how would they be useful to anyone who might need to see them if regulars don't even come across them?  Plus, they are either lacking in meaningful content or the results of over-importing from other projects without regard to redundancy with other help pages. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:26, 18 January 2010 (UTC)

: [[File:Yes check.svg|15px]] '''Done''' Those interested can browse [[User:Swift/Help pages]] to see a (once full) list of help pages. I'm trying to merge, refactor or rewrite these to make our support pages more accessible. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:16, 30 January 2010 (UTC)

== Good point people for WikiBooks to help new editors from Wikipedia? ==
Hi everyone. I'm looking to gather 1-3 contacts for WikiBooks who would be interested in serving as point people for new editors from Wikipedia. I don't expect that it'll be too time consuming, but, just in case we have a new editor stop by the [[w:en:Wikipedia:Teahouse|Teahouse]] who expresses interest in participating in media contributions and you can be friendly and welcome them and perhaps direct them to an area that might interest them. You're welcome to respond here, or even better, on my talk page if you're interested in being added to [[:w:en:Wikipedia:Teahouse/Host_lounge/Project_contacts#Sister_projects|this list]].

== Díalogo 1: El Salón de Clase ==
''La profesora entra en el salón.''

''Profesora'': Buenos días alumnos.  Hoy estudiamos los objetos en el salón de clase. ¿Cuántos libros hay?

''Carlos'': Hay catorce estudiantes.  Hay catorce libros.

''Profesora'': Bien Carlos.  Marianela, ¿Hay un mapa en el salón?

''Marianela'': Sí, señora.  Hay un mapa a la izquierda de la pizarra.  Está en la pared.

''Profesora'': Bien Marianela.  ¿De qué color es el mapa?

''Carlos'': El mapa es verde y azul.  Es el mapa de México.

''Marianela'': ¿Profesora, porqué está el mapa en la pared y no está en la pizarra?

''Profesora'': La pizarra es para escribir con la tiza.  Tengo un borrador aquí.  ¿Quieres escribir la capital de México en la pizarra?

''Marianela'': No sé la capital de México.

''Carlos'': Marianela, mira el mapa.

''Marianela'': Ay, gracias Carlos.  La capital es  Ciudad de México.

''Profesora'': Bien.

== Vocabulario: El Salón de Clase ==
All vocabulary will be given with the appropriate definite article; however, the article will not be translated. In addition, note that all nouns have a gender.  This will be important in later lessons when you begin to learn adjectives.

== Grammar: The Definite Article ==

Like in English, Spanish has definite articles that serve to identify the location of the noun in the sentence.  These are commonly called &quot;noun markers&quot;.  These articles have a gender that is equivalent to the gender of the noun they modify.  However, sometimes pronunciation requires the article to be different than the gender of the word.  In these situations, the gender of the noun will always be indicated.  Otherwise, you can use the article to determine the gender of the noun.

|}
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Examples:&lt;/b&gt; The following examples come from the vocabulary of the first dialogue.  Note that no matter whether the word is singular or plural, the meaning of the definite article does not change.
&lt;br&gt;

== The Indefinite Article ==

In English the indefinite articles are ''a'' and ''an'' (singular) or ''some'' (plural).
In Spanish there are different forms for masculine-gender, feminine-gender, singular or plural.

&lt;center&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color: #FFDEAD; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 0.2em; width: 50%;&quot; valign=top

|-
|
{| style=&quot;width: 100%; text-align: left&quot; 
| colspan=2 | &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: 92%&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&quot;A&quot; or &quot;Some&quot;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; font-weight: bold; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;un&lt;br&gt;
una&lt;br&gt;
unos&lt;br&gt;
unas&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 95%; line-height: 105%&quot;&gt;a (masculine singular)&lt;br&gt;
a (feminine singular)&lt;br&gt;
some (masculine plural)&lt;br&gt;
some (feminine plural)&lt;/span&gt;
|}
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Examples:'''
&lt;br&gt;
{| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:gold&quot;
|-
|un niño
|&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; boy&lt;/i&gt;
|-
|una niña
|&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;a&lt;/b&gt; girl&lt;/i&gt;
|-
|unos niños
|&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;some&lt;/b&gt; boys&lt;/i&gt;
|-
|unas niñas
|&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;some&lt;/b&gt; girls&lt;/i&gt;
|}
&lt;br&gt;
For phonetic reasons some words beginning with accented '''a''' may have the article '''un''': un ave blanca ''(a white bird),'' las aves blancas ''(the white birds)''. This is basically the same idea as '''el ave blanca''' ''(the white bird)''.

Remember, do not confuse uno ''(one)'' with un ''(a or an)''.&lt;br&gt;
Also, do not confuse una ''(a or an)'' with uña ''(fingernail)''.

== The Colors ==

The colors in Spanish are adjectives.  As adjectives, their endings will vary according to the nouns they modify, but these are styled in the masculine singular form.  Most adjectives will be presented to you in this form.

The numbers 16 through 29 can be formed in two ways: (1) using the preposition &quot;y&quot; like
veinte y uno - 21, or (2) as one complete word, changing the spelling of the word like dieciocho (18) or veintiséis (26).
